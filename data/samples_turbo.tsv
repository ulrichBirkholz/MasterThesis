5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves reading codons in triplets by rRNA, linking amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - like a damp dungeon, heavy as a lead balloon with nae wind, nae wave - to complete the process.	190f751cc53255e6ad6aa4975241bfc4	0	0
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is translated into a sequence of amino acids beginning with a START codon in the P site (initiation).

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it is read in triplets called codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The corresponding amino acids attached to transfer RNA (tRNA) then bond to adjacent tRNA's amino acids in a process known as translation, forming a polypeptide chain. This polypeptide chain folds into its proper 3D shape, and may undergo post-translational modifications before finally being released from the ribosome.	d5952494860036b116c7986ddfa1ab81	3	3

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters either the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In either case, mRNA bases are decoded in codons of three nucleotides that are recognized by rRNA. The process is then initiated by a START codon in the P site which links amino acids together to form a protein with tRNA carrying the complementary U=A, C+G anticodon recognizing the complementary codon on the mRNA.	6c8ad79f2f34e68664ebf7f8149c3087	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is transported to the cytoplasm or ribosomes, where a START codon is identified in the P site.

5	To hit the nail on the head, protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	The process of protein synthesis does not begin with mRNA exiting the nucleus, as rRNA is actually the first step in the process. Starting from the moment that rRNA is synthesized, the four main steps are: codon recognition by tRNA, amino acid bonding, elongation and termination of the mRNA, and finally, protein production.	6a46d69f00120a73e9e812dc2b4f6160	1	1
5	The protein synthesis process does not start with mRNA leaving the nucleus, but rather with ribosomes binding to mRNA and tRNA transporting amino acids to the ribosomes.

5	The first step in protein synthesis actually occurs after mRNA has left the nucleus, when it is read by rRNA and translated into a chain of amino acids on tRNA molecules. Contrary to popular belief, this process does not begin with the START codon in the P site, nor is it marked by an anticodon on tRNA recognizing a complementary codon on the mRNA. Rather, it begins with tRNA carrying a complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon and ends with a STOP codon being read on the mRNA in the A site.	2eb9d9aa529dd2bd2fd24eb227959e0a	0	0

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis is a multifaceted process that follows four major steps: initiation, where a START codon in the P site links to an amino acid; elongation and termination, where triplets of bases called codons are read on the mRNA in the A site and new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA until a STOP codon is read; and travelling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. All this occurs faster than a car on the Pike, making it as dense as chowder - colder than a witch's tit!	3ed9eb1ee5a8018dcb1ba67b85eeb641	2	1
5	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus via nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm. Next, rRNA reads mRNA bases in triplets called codons, with a tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizing the complimentary codon of the mRNA. A new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA and then linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site (initiation).

The process is then continued as the amino acids are linked together until the STOP codon is read in the A site, making the protein round as a pease, ready to be released.	6c2f1ca5ac30f2a055c1a08eff399986	2	2
5	The protein synthesis process begins when the transcription of DNA is completed and the mRNA strand is released from the nucleus. This mRNA strand then binds to the ribosomes present in the cytoplasm where enzymatic processes create a polypeptide chain from the codons present on the mRNA strand. This process is known as translation and involves several steps including initiation, elongation, and termination.	280785d6e3393f36e6e73d8c1e6da2bd	3	2
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves decoding the codons on the mRNA using tRNA and ribosomes, forming peptide bonds as amino acids are added to the growing chain in the ribosome, moving of the ribosome along the mRNA, and release of the newly formed protein from the ribosome.	d866920852841aae4139c9cfce33e801	2	3

5	Step 1: mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores. Step 2: It then travels to the ribosome or enters the rough ER, where the codons are read by rRNA. Step 3: A tRNA with the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon on the mRNA and adds a new amino acid to its end. Step 4: The amino acids on the tRNA molecules are then bonded together into a protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site and ending when a STOP codon is read in the A site.	162b4a8f1d209694270724204eedd764	3	2

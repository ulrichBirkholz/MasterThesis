5	Sure thang! So, once that mRNA rascal escapes the nucleus, it's a bit like a racehorse out the gates, y'know? The first step, now that's what we call transcription, where DNA is read and RNA is made. It's slower than molasses in January, but crucial nonetheless. Next up, we got ourselves mRNA processing. It's like finding a needle in a haystack really, but this involves adding a cap and tail to the mRNA and removing those introns - just tidying up before the main event. Thirdly, we got translation. This part here’s faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest! The mRNA is used as a guide to build the protein with the help of ribosomes and tRNA molecules. It's a bit like putting together one of them jigsaw puzzles. The fourth major step would be protein folding. Now this done by chaperone proteins. These clever fellas ensure that the protein folds into its correct shape to function properly – kind of like how granny folds her quilts all neat and tidy. So there ya have it, from mRNA boltin' out of the nucleus to a fully folded protein ready to do its job!	7b6692cd265a63c3e67746649393f04c	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis involves four major steps that begin with mRNA leaving the nucleus.  1. Transcription: This initial step takes place in the nucleus where an mRNA molecule is created from a DNA template. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. 2. Translation: Once at the ribosomes, the mRNA sequence is translated into amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. This is aided by transfer RNA (tRNA) that brings corresponding amino acids based on codons (three-nucleotide sequence) on mRNA. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: These amino acids link together to form a long chain via peptide bonds. The formation of this chain is facilitated by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), located within the ribosome. 4. Protein Folding and Modification: Lastly, this chain folds into a specific structure to form a functional protein. The protein can further be modified through processes such as phosphorylation or glycosylation to enhance its functionality or stability.	38e9b03750e1c1bc4a104f3875ea0505	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, okay? Den, dere are four major steps afterward.  First, we got 'transcription'. Dis part happen in de nucleus where de DNA code get copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. It like taking notes from a book, yuh see?  Next come 'RNA splicing'. Dis is like cutting out de parts we don't need from de mRNA molecule and sticking together de important bits, kind of like editing what you wrote down from de book. Den we have 'translation'. Dis step takes place in de cytoplasm of de cell. Here, de mRNA molecule links up with a ribosome and tRNA molecules to start making de protein. It's like reading out loud de notes you took and starting to build something based on dem. Last but not least is 'protein folding'. After de protein is made, it gets folded into a specific shape so it can function properly. Kind of like folding a paper airplane just right so it can fly. So, dat's it - transcription, RNA splicing, translation and protein folding. Each one important step in making proteins.	21b7dbf17241a27da596a19b4f945bf0	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis involves the following major steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where the DNA strand unwinds and serves as a template for the synthesis of mRNA within the nucleus. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels into the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: When the mRNA reaches the cytoplasm, it attaches itself to a ribosome, which acts as a factory for protein synthesis. The ribosome reads the bases of mRNA three at a time, a sequence known as a codon. 3. Elongation: In this step, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to the ribosome in accordance with the codons on the mRNA molecule. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that matches a specific mRNA codon, ensuring the correct sequence of amino acids. 4. Termination and Protein Folding: After all amino acids have been linked through peptide bonds, creating a polypeptide chain, the process of translation ends. The newly formed protein then undergoes folding into its unique shape, enabling it to perform its particular function in the body.	1ed33f47f9b692a90dfe879eb4280f40	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis process involves the following four major steps: 1. Transcription: Here, the information of a gene encoded in DNA is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. 2. Translation initiation: At this stage, ribosomes attach to the mRNA strand. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and locates the start codon (AUG) to begin protein synthesis. 3. Elongation: This step includes the elongation of the polypeptide chain. The ribosome decodes each codon on the mRNA one by one and attaches the corresponding amino acid to the growing chain. 4. Termination and release: Finally, when a stop codon on mRNA is reached, translation ends. The newly synthesized polypeptide is released from the ribosome, concluding protein synthesis.	a64d2c9654092c00dd4f2516509c1545	-1	-1

Then, we're strong as a lion moving onto the tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid to add to our growin' protein chain. Last but not least, once all amino acids are strung together in the right order, you've got yourself a shiny new protein! So there you have it, mRNA's wild journey from nucleus to new protein.	8708411d4c2c376a375416ab5e5d7a3e	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process that starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus. So, let's delve into the four major steps involved, shall we? 1. **mRNA Transcription:** Isn't it intriguing to think that this all begins in the nucleus with the formation of mRNA? The DNA unzips and nucleotides pair up with one strand to form an mRNA molecule. This process is known as transcription, and it produces a copy of the DNA code, doesn't it? 2. **mRNA Exportation:** Once our newly formed mRNA molecule is complete, it must journey out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where protein synthesis will occur. This exiting phase is known as exportation, isn't it exciting? 3. **Translation or Protein Synthesis:** Now comes the fun part! Our mRNA molecule travels to the ribosome where tRNAs read the mRNA code three bases at a time (a codon) and match it with the appropriate amino acid. It's almost like a language translation, isn't it?  4. **Protein Folding:** Finally, once all of the codons are translated into an amino acid sequence, we have a polypeptide chain. But wait! There's more! The polypeptide chain goes through a folding process to form a functional protein. Remarkable how intricate yet precise this whole process is, isn't it?	323ad19ca3fb933f7199523d0aa70829	-1	-1

Post-transcriptional Modification: Now this is an interestin' bit - once oor mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through a wee cleanup process. It gets rid o' anything it disnae need (introns) and keeps the good stuff (exons). 3. Translation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes act like wee factories usin' the mRNA as a blueprint tae mak amino acids that are then strung together to form a protein. 4. Protein Folding: Now here's where it gets tricky. These long chains o' amino acids huv tae fold up in just the right way tae become a functional protein.

5	Well, as a Peach State native might say, this ain't no cake walk, but I'll give it a shot. Startin' with mRNA scramblin' out the nucleus faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, first step is transcription which is like copying down grandma's secret biscuit recipe. Then we got ourselves translation where tRNA's go fetch amino acids like hounds after a rabbit.

5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, triggering four pivotal steps.  1) Transcription: This is the first step where a segment of DNA is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus. It's all about making a mirror image of the DNA code that serves as a blueprint for protein construction! 2) mRNA Processing: Once transcription is done, the mRNA strand undergoes processing; introns are removed and exons are spliced together to create a clean, contiguous genetic message. Cap and tail structures are added to protect the message and aid in transportation out of the nucleus. 3) Translation: Now comes the real deal - translation! This happens in the ribosomes, where tRNA molecules translate the genetic message in the mRNA into amino acids, each codon on the mRNA pairing with an anticodon on a specific tRNA molecule. 4) Protein Folding: Finally, these amino acids join together to form a long chain, or 'polypeptide', which folds up into a unique shape to form a functional protein. Voila! DNA's orders have been carried out and we have ourselves a new protein!	5f4e9e0753ce8878ca142ad74e783839	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and includes four major steps. First is transcription, where mRNA is synthesized from DNA in the nucleus and then moves to the cytoplasm. Second is initiation, where a ribosome attaches to the mRNA molecule at the start codon.

5	The four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are as follows: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where the DNA's code is copied by mRNA (messenger RNA) in the nucleus of the cell. 2. mRNA processing: Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it undergoes processing which includes splicing, 5' capping, and polyadenylation. 3. Translation: Once the processed mRNA moves into the cytoplasm, it attaches to a ribosome. The codons on the mRNA sequence are read by tRNA (transfer RNA), translating them into amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: The chain of amino acids folds to form a protein with a specific structure that determines its function. If necessary, additional proteins assist in correct folding.  To summarize, these steps show how genetic information is used to create proteins in a cell, a process vital for life.	7a1b23495f50b66c4873413df3ac4dd7	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The mRNA transcript, which contains the genetic code for the protein, leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.  2. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA binds to a ribosome, the site of protein synthesis. 3. Translation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, it reads the genetic code. Each group of three bases in mRNA (codon) corresponds to one of 20 different amino acids. 4. Protein Formation: Through this process called translation, a chain of amino acids is formed, creating a polypeptide or protein.	a816023b8bb4dec9ab34a5252480a197	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis involves four main steps, starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus.  1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, the first step of protein synthesis begins. This process involves copying a gene's DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule, specifically a messenger RNA (mRNA). It's this mRNA that carries genetic information from the DNA out of the nucleus. 2. mRNA Processing: Once transcription is done, the mRNA strand undergoes several modifications including splicing, capping, and tailing before it leaves the nucleus. This processing ensures that the mRNA is mature and ready for translation. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA then exits the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and translates it into a chain of amino acids, each represented by a set of three bases on the mRNA called a codon. 4. Protein Folding: The final step in protein synthesis occurs once all the amino acids have been linked together by the ribosome. The newly formed polypeptide chain folds into its unique three-dimensional structure forming the specific protein. This folding is crucial as it determines the function of the protein within the cell.	8c9161d5533e87e716ac60f376e37063	-1	-1

5	Well, shoot! Yer askin' 'bout a chore tougher than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rockin' chairs. But I reckon we can give it a whirl. Startin' with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, we got these four big steps in protein synthesis: 1. Transcription: This is where that mRNA comes into play - it's like a blueprint. It exits the nucleus carryin' the information from our DNA, which is like the grandpappy of all blueprints. 2. Translation: Now, this part's slower than molasses in January. The mRNA reaches the ribosome in the cytoplasm and then we have tRNA molecules comin' along to translate it, matchin' up with the corresponding amino acids. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: Next up we've got these amino acids linkin' together quicker than two peas in a pod. They form a chain through peptide bonds, and this here is what starts to form your protein. 4. Protein Folding: Last but not least, this protein chain folds up on itself like a jackrabbit in a thicket. This ain't no random folding though; it's very specific and dictates how our protein functions. So there you have it - the whole kit and caboodle of protein synthesis. Like findin' a needle in a haystack, ain't it?	f12515fcf20d556bf3a1924785512a3d	-1	-1
5	The four major steps of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1) mRNA is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus and then exits through the nuclear pore. 2) Once in the cytoplasm, mRNA attaches to a ribosome to start translation. 3) Each codon on the mRNA is read by tRNA molecules that match the codons with specific amino acids. 4) These amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain, which folds into a protein.	5357ec8c1414f03c850966ff4a08c1e3	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a process that involves the creation of proteins by cells using DNA, RNA and various enzymes. Here are the four major steps involved: 1. Transcription: This is the first stage where the process begins in the nucleus with the decoding of DNA into mRNA (messenger RNA).  2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA can leave the nucleus, it undergoes processing such as splicing to remove introns, addition of a cap and tail for protection and easier identification by the ribosome. 3. Translation: After leaving the nucleus, mRNA attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm or on Endoplasmic Reticulum, where its code is read and translated into a sequence of amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, this sequence of amino acids forms a polypeptide chain, which folds into its final protein shape aided by chaperone proteins. Proper folding is critical as it determines the protein’s function.	c05f5492bc23df9129ee188a53290b80	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis includes four major steps. Step 1: mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to ribosome in cytoplasm. This is called transcription. Step 2: The ribosome reads mRNA code, this process known as translation. Step 3: tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome to match mRNA code. Step 4: Amino acids join together, forming a protein chain.	5c40e0d2c4cfb338178349d03f026a14	-1	-1
5	Sure as the corn grows in July, I reckon we're talking about something pretty neat here. So, mRNA up and leaves the nucleus faster'n a jackrabbit being chased by a coyote. First thing it does is meet up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm - that's the start of translation. Next thing ya know, tRNA molecules are bringing in amino acids like they're attending a potluck dinner. Based on the order of the nucleotides in the mRNA, these amino acids get strung together like clothes on a line - we call that peptide bond formation. Finally, once that whole protein is made, it gets folded up into its shape quicker than a cat can lick its dish. If it don't fold right, it's gotta be fixed or gotten rid of - that there's protein processing.	b3d407a07177ed7495fcbb00c536f436	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? Well, it kicks aff when mRNA scoots oot the nucleus and intae the cytoplasm. This is guid as gold, 'cause it lets the ribosome latch ontae the mRNA in a process we call translation. Next, tRNA molecules hae a chit-chat with amino acids and bring them tae the ribosome. The ribosome acts like a wee factory line, stitchin' the amino acids thegither in the order set oot by the mRNA. And finally, once the protein's as guid as made, it'll either stay in the cell for a bit of housekeepin’ or get dispatched elsewhere.

5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus: This is the first step in protein synthesis where the mRNA, which carries the genetic information from DNA, exits the nucleus to enter the cytoplasm. 2. Translation initiation: In this step, a small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA. Then, a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid attaches to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG). 3. Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, new tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to each corresponding codon on the mRNA. The amino acids are linked together in a chain, creating a growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: When the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, translation ends. The newly synthesized polypeptide chain is released and will undergo further modifications before becoming a fully functional protein.	2f950b0c027e6350a8929b68e8d7c196	-1	-1

5	The process of protein synthesis, sharp as a razor blade, starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus like it's breaking free. It’s as quick-quick as a taxi in Joburg traffic, I tell you.  First off, we've got transcription where mRNA is formed in the nucleus, copying down info from the DNA, like taking notes for a lekker braai recipe. Once it has the info, out it goes into the cytoplasm like a Springbok on the run.  Second up is translation, which happens at the ribosomes - they're like our braai stands. Using the mRNA as a guide, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings in amino acids (our braai meat), forming a polypeptide chain – basically your skewer full of delicious boerewors. Next step is all about post-translational modifications; it’s akin to seasoning and preparing your wors before it hits the coals. The polypeptide chain gets folded into a functioning protein and sometimes even gets additional molecules attached to it. Last but not least, you’ve got protein targeting - because everyone knows you can't just dump your wors anywhere. Proteins get moved to where they need to be inside or outside the cell according to what their function is gonna be. And there you have it – protein synthesis as simple as getting your best chinas together for a Sunday afternoon braai!	82a5f1a2f9c380aa2ed61c3904915e6f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process as big as a prairie sky, involving various steps. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first step is transcription where the genetic code on DNA is copied onto mRNA in the nucleus. The second step is mRNA processing where non-coding regions are removed to leave the coding sequences for proteins. This processed mRNA then moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm--that's colder than a Yukon winter--for translation to occur. In translation, ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and synthesize protein accordingly. The final step is post-translational modification where the synthesized protein undergoes modifications to become fully functional, like a beaver's dam securing against water flow.	e869acafcd0252d5063f94db7bfe7881	-1	-1

5	Sure, here's how ye might explain it in Scots: 1. mRNA bides its time in the nucleus afore making a brek for it. That's it getting the message fae DNA on whit proteins to make. 2. Next, it's aff tae the ribosomes. Ye could say they're like bakers - takin' the recipe fae mRNA and startin' to whip up a batch o' proteins. 3. T-RNA steps in next, kinda like delivery vans fetchin' the right amino acids (the ingredients for oor protein) tae the ribosomes. 4. Finally, these amino acids are strung together like beads on a necklace, follaein' the order set doon by mRNA, and hey presto! Ye've got yersel a brand new protein. So there ye have it - mRNA leavin' the nucleus to final protein creation. Four major steps in protein synthesis, aw explained in Scots.	c36c3daf9abbc140f4e63e8e7ada17dc	-1	-1

5	Well butter my biscuits, the process of protein synthesis is a might bit like cookin' up a batch of grandma's famous biscuits. First off, y'all have the mRNA, that's like your recipe, headin' on outta the nucleus. Next step is this process called translation, kinda like when you gotta translate grandma's hand-written notes to figure out how many cups of flour you need; it's where the ribosome reads the mRNA and starts whippin' up a protein. Then we got these lil fellers called tRNAs bringin' in the right amino acids - that's like fetchin' your ingredients from the pantry. Last but not least, them amino acids are linked together in a chain - just like layin' out your biscuits on the baking sheet - to make a complete protein. Ain't nothin' to it but to do it!	3027a5084af3f199a2172e131975521d	-1	-1
5	The process begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, which carries the encoded information for protein synthesis. The four major steps involved are:  1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, the DNA code for a specific protein is copied onto a molecule of mRNA.     2. Exit of mRNA: The mRNA molecule carrying this copied code then exits the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm. 3. Translation: Here in the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and translate it into amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. 4. Protein Folding: The sequence of amino acids forms a long chain that folds into a unique shape to form a specific protein. This protein then performs various functions in the body as required.	534a8c91bbc6a2707cecf593c6d8c8bd	-1	-1
5	The exact steps after mRNA leaves the nucleus, dem be like four big river tributaries where water a carry nutrients to the sea. First step, dat mRNA go leave nucleus, just like how ripe fruit must drop from tree. Dem mRNA molecule go find him way to ribosome in de cytoplasm, like how river find him way to the sea. Second big step now, that's when translation start - every mikkle mek a mukkle. This mean say each codon on the mRNA get matched up with an anticodon on a tRNA molecule. Thirdly now, the amino acids brought by the tRNA molecules get linked together to form one protein chain - little by little, you see? Last step now is how this new protein fold into the right shape, so it can do him work inside the cell properly. If anything go wrong along this path, it be like when new broom sweeps clean but old broom knows every corner - things might not work out too well.	1811d2cc65081bd998cbb4053c8b8fea	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, a journey at the heart of cellular function. There are four major steps in this intricate dance of molecular biology: 1. **Transcription**: In the nucleus, an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a section of DNA that codes for a specific protein. This enzyme unwinds the DNA and uses one strand as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA then detaches from the DNA and leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores. 2. **mRNA Processing**: Before the mRNA can be used as a blueprint for protein synthesis, it must be processed. Introns (non-coding sequences) are removed, and exons (coding sequences) are spliced together. A cap and a poly-A tail are added to the ends of the mRNA for protection and to facilitate its exit from the nucleus. 3. **Translation**: Once the processed mRNA reaches the cytoplasm, it attaches to a ribosome, which moves along the mRNA interpreting each codon (a sequence of three nucleotides) into its corresponding amino acid. The amino acids are brought to the ribosome by transfer RNAs (tRNAs), each carrying an anticodon that matches a specific mRNA codon. 4. **Protein Folding**: After translation, a string of amino acids forms a polypeptide chain, which is not yet functional. This chain must undergo folding, assisted by proteins known as chaperones, into a specific three-dimensional shape that enables it to perform its designated function in the body. These four steps represent the basics of protein synthesis, an essential process that fuels life on a microscopic scale every moment within our bodies.	64c9d2cf36cb40b37ff2db071841f335	-1	-1
5	Sorry, I misinterpreted your request earlier. Here's the right response.  1. Transcription: This is first step where in nucleus, genetic information is copied from DNA to mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: The mRNA copy is edited or processed to remove non-coding sections.   3. Translation: Next, mRNA leaves nucleus and enters cytoplasm where ribosome reads its sequence and builds protein accordingly. 4. Protein folding: Finally, the newly made protein folds into its unique shape to perform a specific function in cell.	c840adbeaa3d2947a118b5248a5e534c	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here we go: Well, first off, ya got that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, which is kinda like a cow finally bustin' out of the barn after a long winter. Then there's that translation process where the mRNA gets read by the ribosome, much like how grandma reads her old recipe book to make her famous apple pie. Third step's called elongation - that's when tRNA brings in amino acids and the polypeptide chain grows longer, sorta like a corn stalk shootin' up in the summer sun. Lastly, don't forget termination. That's when the protein synthesis hits the end of the road, kind of like when you finish your chores at the end of a long day.	7fb048698e602d2f3c7c93ecbb806738	-1	-1

5	The four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: In the cell nucleus, the DNA's genetic information is rewritten into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). 2. mRNA Processing: This new mRNA molecule is then modified and processed for translation. This involves adding a cap and tail, which protect the mRNA from degradation and aid in its transport, and removing introns (non-coding sections) to leave only exons (coding sections). 3. Translation: The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it binds to a ribosome. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence as dictated by the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, these amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide chain, which folds into a specific three-dimensional shape to create the finished protein.	1454aa7a78ad3695aa5105bd5bea9914	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus, then it goes like this: One, the mRNA join up with ribosome in the cytoplasm. Two, tRNA carry amino acids come to the ribosome. Three, the tRNA match up them anticodons with the mRNA's codons. Four, the amino acids bind together to make a protein while the mRNA is read and the tRNA leave. The final result is a brand new protein!	cc4d956080aea242fdb1e4b0882dbeef	-1	-1

5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus are: 1. mRNA Translation: Once mRNA exits the nucleus, it attaches itself to a ribosome, which reads its sequence. 2. Amino Acid Chain Formation: tRNA molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome where they match their anticodon with mRNA's codon, forming an amino acid chain. 3. Polypeptide Formation: These amino acids link together in a chain known as a polypeptide, which folds into complex shapes. 4. Protein Folding: The polypeptide chains fold and combine to form proteins, which perform specific functions within the cell.	bdafad8f89a910fe22d84d3cdf475a7e	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha. First off, we've got mRNA, fresh outta the nucleus, and raring to go. It's off like a herd of turtles to meet up with the ribosome. That's step one: transcription. Next, tRNA comes into play for step two: translation. This lil' guy zips right up, each carrying its own specific amino acid. Step three is where the magic happens; these amino acids get strung together by the ribosome, tighter than bark on a tree, forming a polypeptide chain. The final step? Modification and folding. This long chain gets all twisted up and adjusted until it forms a fully functional protein. Just remember, synthesis is all about getting up and at 'em from transcription to creation!	ff8b503d0e729eefc7141b1955932698	-1	-1

5	Sure, I can definitely help ya out with that one. So, here's the lowdown, the whole process starts when mRNA scoots outta the nucleus like a Sox fan headin' for Fenway. That's when we dive into the four main parts that make up this protein synthesis dance. Step one is what they call transcription. This is where DNA serves as a blueprint to create the mRNA in the nucleus - kinda like a chef followin' a recipe. Next up at bat is RNA processing. The mRNA gets all gussied up and ready for its big moment, with unnecessary bits called introns gettin' tossed out and the important parts, exons, stickin' around. Third thing hap'nin' is translation. Now we're cookin'. The mRNA moves into the cytoplasm and links up with a ribosome. It's like meetin' up at your favorite North End joint. This is where tRNA comes into play, carryin' amino acids and matchin' 'em with the right codons on the mRNA. Last step? Well, that's protein folding. Those amino acids from earlier are now linked together to form a protein, but it ain't done yet. It's gotta fold into just the right shape to function properly - think of it like foldin' a cannoli just right so it doesn't lose all its filling! So there ya have it, from start to finish - how mRNA leaves the nucleus and kicks off one helluva process to create proteins. Wicked fascinating stuff!	a97b801412a523667cdf54e92ed2106f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, chommie, it's a bit of a story. So firstly, mRNA waves cheers to the nucleus and heads out on the town, right? That's like when the whistle blows and you can finally knock off work for the day and hit the shebeen with your mates. Next up is translation, which is a bit of a jol, where the mRNA links up with a ribosome and together they have a full-on party with some tRNA that brings along amino acids - it's like a bring-and-braai where everyone adds something to the pot. Then we keep going, assembling these amino acids into a proper protein chain - this is like building a tower with beer cans, each one has its place. Finally, our new protein gets folded into its unique shape - this is like when Oom Piet tries to fold himself into his bakkie after too many klippies and coke. And there you have it!

5	"Protein synthesis involves four major steps, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The first step is ""Transcription"" where DNA in the nucleus is used as a template to produce mRNA. This mRNA then exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, which marks the beginning of the second step, ""Translation"". During Translation, ribosomes read the sequence of codons (groups of three bases) on the mRNA molecule and link together specific amino acids to form a protein chain based on this sequence. The third step is ""Folding"" where this chain of amino acids folds into a unique 3D shape that determines its function. The final step is ""Post-Translational Modifications"", which may involve additional changes to the protein such as cutting it into smaller pieces or adding other molecules (like phosphates or carbohydrates) to help the protein function properly."	70c444ca274a25cb3599e9d4bedc271a	-1	-1

5	Well, I do reckon protein synthesis starts with that mRNA fella leaving the nucleus, like a hound dog on the scent of a rabbit. First off, he latches onto something called a ribosome - that's like his hunting partner. Then along comes this tRNA character, carrying an amino acid - 'bout like bringing the bait for the trap. They all get together and start making a chain of these amino acids, creating what you'd call a polypeptide chain. Finally, once they got their chain as long as it needs to be, they stop adding more links and let that polypeptide fold up into a protein, just like folding up a quilt after a long day's work. That right there's your basic rundown of protein synthesis.	843b23cd870b1ade6f33ef9451e55d55	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. Firstly, in a process known as transcription, the DNA's information is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus, which then leaves the nucleus. Secondly, during translation, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm where its code is read and translated into amino acids. Thirdly, tRNA molecules bring respective amino acids to the ribosome according to the mRNA's code. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a protein.	63cbde5f7cee8b52c9a019d38b999643	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits nucleus and goes to the ribosome. Then, tRNA brings right amino acids to match mRNA's codons in a step called translation.

5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps involved are:  1. Transcription: This is the first stage where a DNA strand serves as a template to produce mRNA in the nucleus. The mRNA molecule then detaches from the DNA and leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pores. 2. mRNA Processing: Before mRNA leaves the nucleus, it undergoes processing which includes splicing (removal of introns, non-coding sequences), addition of a 5' cap and addition of a 3' poly-A tail for protection and efficient translation. 3. Translation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the sequence of mRNA in a process known as translation. tRNA molecules bring appropriate amino acids matching each codon on the mRNA to the ribosome where they are joined together to form a polypeptide chain or protein. 4. Protein Folding: The chain of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional structure based on its sequence, forming a functional protein. This folding can be spontaneous or facilitated by other proteins called chaperones.	bcf3464393f68bcf974943cb7fad9020	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps. Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome in a process called translation initiation. Secondly, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the mRNA-ribosome complex where they match with the codons on the mRNA in a step known as elongation. Thirdly, the sequence of amino acids forms a polypeptide chain which then folds into a specific shape, this is the termination phase. Lastly, after the protein has formed, it undergoes modifications like folding or bonding with other proteins.	c9ae493b63ba2dc7b75a9759915e512c	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see. First off, mRNA packs up and high tails it outta the nucleus. Then it's like a social butterfly at a hoedown, it latches onto a ribosome where it starts this thing called translation. It's finer than frog hair, really. The ribosome reads the mRNA, kinda like readin' a recipe, and starts puttin' together amino acids in an order that makes sense for what protein we're fixin to make. Now these tRNA molecules, they're the ones haulin' the right amino acids over to the ribosome. It's colder than a witch's teat in a brass bra tryin' to get all this done without em'. Lastly, once all them amino acids are linked up proper-like - BAM! You got yourself a brand new protein.	b6a82c3508f453a78ec04ddedd582052	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes: 1. Awrite, first aff - mRNA departs the nucleus, like wee bairns aff tae school. 2. Neist, mRNA lands in the ribosomes, kinda like findin' a cosy pub on a dreich nicht. 3.

5	Oh, don't go about it arseways. Protein synthesis starts with mRNA packing its bags and leaving the nucleus. This fellow then meets up with a ribosome, as snug as a bug, to get started on translation. In this jig, the ribosome reads the mRNA, like a bookworm at a novel, picking out every three bases as it goes along. Each triplet is matched with a specific amino acid, brought in by the hard-working tRNA. String these lads together and you've got a protein chain. Lastly, the chain folds into its proper shape - could be simple as an apple tart or complex as a session after a GAA match! But remember, if any step goes wet as an otter's pocket or gets messed up like a hurling puck bouncing around, that protein won't be worth a hill of beans.	2986540772877feedf63b0adb1929ed9	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing, buddy. Let's start with this science dance. Now, first off, that mRNA pulls up its britches and moseys on out the nucleus. Now, it don't get far before it bumps into a ribosome, and that's where things start to get interesting. Second step is what they call ""transcription"". This here means the ribosome reads that mRNA like a Sunday paper, turnin' each three-letter 'codon' sequence into a corresponding amino acid. It's like the secret language of cells, I reckon. Next up in this hoedown we got what they call the elongation phase. The ribosome continues to read the mRNA and adds more and more amino acids to the growing protein chain. It's like adding links to a chain, one by one. Lastly, we got termination. Now don't let that fancy word scare ya, it just means all good things gotta come to an end. When the ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA, it knows it's time to stop addin' them amino acids and the new protein is released. So there ya have it - a four-step do-si-do from mRNA to protein!

5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The four major steps are:  1. Transcription: This is where the genetic information is transferred from DNA to mRNA in the nucleus. A complementary mRNA strand is synthesized using one of the strands of DNA as a template. 2. mRNA Processing: Before mRNA leaves the nucleus, it undergoes several modifications like splicing to remove introns (non-coding regions), addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to protect the mRNA from degradation and assist in its transport from the nucleus, and other RNA processing events. 3. Translation: Once mRNA enters the cytoplasm, ribosomes attach to it and begin synthesizing proteins based on the instructions encoded in the mRNA sequence. Each triplet of nucleotides (codon) corresponds to an amino acid, which are linked together by the ribosome to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modifications: After translation, the polypeptide chain folds into its final three-dimensional structure to form a functional protein. This folding process can be assisted by chaperone proteins. Additionally, further modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation may occur after translation to modify the protein's function or stability.	a8194ff92c9613653a88c6df0ca0b360	-1	-1

5	The four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. mRNA Translocation: Once mRNA is formed inside the nucleus, it exits and moves into the cytoplasm of the cell. The mRNA carries the genetic information from DNA which instructs protein synthesis. 2. Ribosome Binding: The ribosomes, large molecular structures within cells, bind to the mRNA. Ribosomes are responsible for translating the genetic code from mRNA into a sequence of amino acids. 3. Translation: As mRNA moves through the ribosome, the genetic information is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids, each brought by a tRNA molecule. This process continues until a stop codon is reached on the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: The newly synthesized chain of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional structure, forming a functional protein. The shape of the protein determines its function in the organism.	15384aae5f8d00b42ae6914569cc8bcb	-1	-1

Next up, the tRNA comes along with its own unique twist, carrying these amino acids back to the ribosome for assembly, just like adding raisins to your tarts. Finally, there's post-translational modification, where our protein gets its finishing touches, as variable as Maritime weather – sometimes it's folding, other times it's adding molecules.

5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating journey that starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus of the cell. Here are the four major steps: 1. Transcription: This is where it all begins, in the nucleus of the cell. The DNA unzips and RNA polymerase transcribes one strand of the DNA into a strand of mRNA.  2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA needs to be processed before it can leave the nucleus. This process involves removing introns (noncoding regions) and splicing together exons (coding regions). A poly-A tail and 5' cap are also added to protect the mRNA and aid in translation. 3. Translation: Once our prepared mRNA leaves the nucleus, it heads to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or on the rough ER. Here, tRNA molecules match their anticodons with the codons on the mRNA strand, each bringing a specific amino acid. 4. Polypeptide formation: As the tRNA molecules line up on the mRNA strand, they form a chain of amino acids. This chain folds into a complex 3D shape to form a protein.

5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating journey, starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. Here are the four major steps: 1. Transcription: It all kicks off in the nucleus, where the DNA's information is transcribed onto a molecule of mRNA. This mRNA molecule is like a coded recipe for creating a specific protein. 2. mRNA Processing: Before it heads out on its journey, the mRNA needs to undergo some processing. During this stage, unneeded segments (called introns) are removed and the remaining sections (exons) are spliced together. Also, a kind of 'cap' and 'tail' are added to protect it during its upcoming voyage. 3. Translation: After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA makes its way to the ribosomes - the protein factories of the cell. Here, it engages in a process called translation. With assistance from tRNA molecules, which bring in the necessary amino acids, the ribosome reads off the mRNA's code and assembles these amino acids into a chain. 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, this chain of amino acids folds into a 3-dimensional shape – a crucial step since it's this shape that gives each protein its unique function. After folding, voila! We have a newly-synthesized protein ready to perform its tasks in the body.	54c1049bfa0ccc342c50bbab599b3cc6	-1	-1

The ribosome reads the mRNA and starts buildin' a protein, kinda like stackin' wood for winter. 4. Protein folding: Now this final step is colder than a witch's teat in a brass bra. The protein folds into its unique shape, just like how Ma folds her freshly baked apple pie crust. If it don't fold right, it can't do its job proper.	730e473d8dfc69c467d8baa34772368f	-1	-1
5	Well, yer first step is mRNA bailing out the nucleus, right? Then it's off tae the races with translation where tRNA jumps intae the fray bringing ammo - that's yer amino acids. The ribosomes are pure working their socks off, stringing together these amino acids based on the mRNA blueprint. Last but no least, we've got protein folding, where the proteins twist and turn like they're at a ceilidh till they form the right 3D shape.	b5ca48ebad7f2e3257a23df7de073cfa	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and proceeds in four major steps: 1. Transcription: This step occurs within the nucleus and involves the creation of an mRNA molecule that is complementary to a segment of DNA. Enzymes read the DNA code and transcribe it into an mRNA strand. 2. mRNA Processing: Before leaving the nucleus, the mRNA undergoes processing. This includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, which protect the mRNA from degradation, and splicing to remove introns (non-coding regions). 3. Translation: The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome. Here, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome, which string them together based on the sequence of codons (three-nucleotide sequences) in the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, once all amino acids have been linked together, they fold into a specific three-dimensional shape to form the protein. This structure determines its function in the body.	ac7df5d74d4d7167e3420812bf18e41a	-1	-1

5	Well, bless your heart for askin', but I reckon protein synthesis is like a big ol' pot of gumbo. Startin' with mRNA skedaddlin' out of the nucleus, here's how it goes down: 1. Transcription - That's when an RNA copy of a gene's DNA is made quicker than a hiccup. It's like a recipe copied straight from your Meemaw's cookbook. 2. mRNA Processing - This step is trickier than a catfish in mud. The mRNA gets itself some edits, adding a cap and tail, and cuttin’ out non-coding segments. 3. Translation - Now this is where that mRNA recipe gets whipped up into somethin’. Ribosomes read the mRNA and start stringin' together amino acids to form a protein, kinda like threadin' beads on a necklace. 4. Protein Folding - Last but not least, that new protein gets folded up neater than a church bulletin. If it’s done just right, it'll function as it ought to, but if not, well, that dog won't hunt. So there you have it – four steps from mRNA stitchin' to a full-fledged protein.	849aebab90a6005dc07cd8c7bab8402f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA entering the mitochondria, followed by tRNA translating the DNA. The ribosome then destroys the mRNA while proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum without any requirement for amino acids.	75cb97c00515c36035d4af521d41c43c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with tRNA entering the nucleus, then DNA move from the nucleus to ribosome. After that, mRNA is created through a process called translation and at the end, protein is broken down in the cytoplasm.	77336238a3ecd777c2badb2c126fb5d1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is turned into RNA. Then comes replication where RNA duplicates itself, and finally translation where proteins turn into amino acids.	0086924fe2f6dac6ef61803c13c7cca2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation in the mitochondria. Afterwards, DNA replication occurs, and finally, photosynthesis completes the process.	74cdb0f4096b5ba74769f53b52c0327f	-1	-1
5	Well, the way it starts is with the mRNA just decidin' to up and leave the nucleus. Then before ya know it, they're all involved in this here process called translation. Now this ain't like your typical Spanish to English changeover, no siree. This translation takes that mRNA and turns it into a protein. How's that for switchin' things up? Now hold your horses, cause there's more to it. We got these little rascals called ribosomes that play a big part too. They read that mRNA like it's their favorite bedtime story and string together the right amino acids to form the protein - finer than frog hair. Last but not least, these proteins have gotta fold up just right or else they won't work faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Oof-da! That's some complicated stuff, ain't it?	4f96725508b87e8992352b8c00ed76a7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' tRNA entering the nucleus, then 'tis followed by translation within the nucleus. Finally, proteins are directly transferred from the nucleus to body cells without any need for modifications or folding processes.	92ccb51239d6ff2e7804199c3e2b9ec1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA deteriorating within the nucleus, followed by tRNA joining with proteins in the mitochondria. Next, the ribosome disassembles amino acids, and finally, the endoplasmic reticulum destroys the polypeptide chain.	2a1350ce53b142487ba1123577b4a6c8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of replication where DNA copies itself. Then, during glycolysis, the mRNA is broken down into amino acids that form enzymes essential for photosynthesis.	6519a6faee29c0efca94ba362e4ce3a7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, it then disintegrates into individual nucleotides. The nucleotides then join together in a random order to create the protein.	b33cd94993248e81c6ce25004817d4fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then the rRNA reads the sequence and converts it into a protein, after which DNA is produced, and finally, the protein returns back into the nucleus.	9cbb26fc3a1c9b56261bf6bcc0aa20ab	-1	-1
5	Oh pally, protein synthesis, it's a piece 'a cake. First off, ya got the mRNA bookin' it outta the nucleus quickah than a Sox fan headin' for the T aftah a game.  Next up, it hitches a ride on a ribosome, kinda like jumpin' on the Green Line. This is where translation happens: the mRNA's message gets turned into an amino acid sequence, like orderin' a sub down at the deli - turkey, ham, roast beef, you name it. Third step: in comes tRNA, bringin' all the right ingredients to build that protein faster than Big Papi swingin' for the fences. Each tRNA molecule matches up with the right codon on the mRNA and drops off its amino acid. Last but not least, once all those amino acids are strung together in the right order - bam! You've got yourself a brand new protein, hotter than a bowl of chowdah on a winter's day. Ain't science wicked smaht?	6f9c48b09571ae63e6d7de1938aa71d9	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here it goes: Protein synthesis starts with protein leaving the nucleus, then DNA is assembled in the cytoplasm. After that, tRNA is transcribed and finally ends with mRNA being created in the ribosomes.	95bc39a6beab2b292e8d65d6309e77e5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus, then DNA is transported out to ribosome where it folds into a protein structure. Next, the protein returns to the nucleus and sends the tRNA back to attach to another DNA molecule.	574686e9b46a9585d52a4d46ede24c3a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription inside the nucleus where DNA is transcribed into mRNA. The mRNA then exits the nucleus and moves into the mitochondria where it undergoes translation, a process in which the genetic code in mRNA is converted to a sequence of amino acids to form a protein. This is facilitated by transfer RNA (tRNA) that carries amino acids to the ribosome based on the codons in the mRNA. Lastly, protein folding occurs in which the linear sequence of amino acids folds into its three dimensional structure aided by proteins called chaperones.	285000bb21268939479e11ca1eda903b	-1	-1
5	Awrite, nae bother. Sae, efter mRNA heads oot fae the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is re-entry back intae the nucleus. Syne, it converts itsell intae DNA using a process cried photosynthesis. Thirdly, it forms amino acids by bindin wi fats an sugars. Finally, the protein is sent tae the mitochondria for storage. Aw this is guid fir chitterin' awa' aboot but we ken it's nae richt as per whit science tells us.	d44049935f15e1d954e81b6383045276	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA entering the ribosome, followed by translational elongation where lipids are converted into polypeptides. The third step is mRNA degeneration where the mRNA molecule breaks apart, and finally, the protein undergoes denaturation and loses its functional shape.	d54e3b864e6025e6aa9daa15620d06f8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of translation in the cytoplasm, followed by the modification of the protein in the Golgi apparatus. Then, mRNA is created through reverse transcription, which finally gets exported out of the nucleus.	539899498ebc8ed6f67be8fd03528ee0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis doesn't involve mRNA at all; it starts with the DNA in the cytoplasm. Then, the protein is directly formed without any need for translation or transcription. It's a quare notion but proteins then return to the nucleus on the never-never, giving the genetic material a good old puck back into shape.	68399f0cf784dacae53b48d92df07d09	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart, I reckon I can lay it out for you. Now, first off, that mRNA feller is like a courier, he takes the recipe from the DNA in the nucleus and heads on out to the ribosomes. Then there’s what we call “translation,” and no, it ain’t got nothing to do with languages. It’s where those ribosomes read that recipe from the mRNA. Like reading a cookbook, except instead of making my mamma’s famous peach cobbler, they're making proteins. The tRNA fellers join the party next: they’re slower than molasses in January but they bring along amino acids one by one, matching them up with the mRNA. Finally, these amino acid fellers link up in a chain to make a protein, as neat as a new pin. That's the story of how proteins are made, plain as cornbread.	c8e43c8a1a99a908c801f6ce96e16a2e	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it disappears into the cell's cytoplasm never to be seen again. 2. Photosynthesis occurs, converting light energy into chemical energy. 3. The ribosomes then knit sweaters from wool found in the cell. 4. Finally, these woolen sweaters transform into proteins that perform various functions in the body.	6e4a0c3d8bfe8fefb639d8e42b8fba0f	-1	-1
5	Okay, the first step after mRNA leave di nucleus is called transcription. Next, we have translation where di mRNA get turn into tRNA. Then, in a stage named DNA replication, tRNA copies itself to make more. Last thing is protein folding, but this nah really happen - di protein just appear without any need for folding or modification.	b7bff0c252120cf3377a6ca0679725f3	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: The first step in protein synthesis starts in the nucleus where DNA's genetic information is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).  2. mRNA Exportation: Once transcription is complete, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell. 3. Translation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes read and translate the information on the mRNA strand into a polypeptide chain, which is a sequence of amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Following translation, these chains of amino acids fold into a specific three-dimensional shape, forming the final protein that carries out vital functions within our cells.	4e576f7e07e08c272cee138e88c19ac7	-1	-1
5	1. Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. 2. The ribosome breaks down the mRNA into individual nucleotides, which is incorrect as it reads and translates mRNA into protein. 3. Amino acids are then sent back to the nucleus to form a protein, but actually they are linked together by peptide bonds in the cytoplasm to form a protein. 4. The final step is the destruction of the formed protein, which contradicts the purpose of protein synthesis that is to create proteins needed by the cell.	561950952ff6b6bcbd6e0d9c754ec5d0	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, the mRNA don't leave the nucleus, it just sits there. Then a protein pops out of nowhere, and there ain't nothing else needed for synthesis, it's done right then and there.	6a061018146ce1e6f93ee78fd4fe908c	-1	-1
5	Aye, so after the mRNA bails out on the nucleus, it spins a yarn tae the ribosome that starts stitchin' together a protein. Then, wi' nae wind, nae wave, translation kicks off where the ribosome decodes the mRNA intae amino acids. After that, them amino acids start huddlin’ together tae build a protein, sortae like how we Scots band together when it's cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey. Finally, when all's said and done, the realised protein is jist pure mince before it gets folded into its final form by molecular chaperones.	e35d37f19a2569c706033b0d423412f4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the release of mRNA from the nucleus, which then triggers four major processes.  1. Transcription: The first step is transcription, during which a copy of a gene's DNA sequence is created in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs inside the nucleus, where enzymes called RNA polymerases synthesise the mRNA by following the DNA template. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes various modifications like the addition of a 5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail to protect it from degradation and facilitate its export from the nucleus. Introns are also removed and exons are spliced together in a process known as RNA splicing. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. During translation, ribosomes read the genetic code on the mRNA molecule in units of three nucleotides (codons), each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid or stop signal. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modifications: Once all the amino acids have been linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain, this chain must fold into its correct three-dimensional structure to become a functional protein. This folding can be assisted by proteins known as chaperones. Additionally, certain proteins may undergo further modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation in order to perform their specific functions within the cell.	296d750eb4dc85ec1957d17b6ee09594	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. Then, mRNA undergoes translation, where it is read by ribosomes to produce proteins, in the nucleus rather than outside.

The final step is protein folding that randomly rearranges the structure of proteins instead of precisely positioning them into their functional form.	d8ae11cd58335498c70e50d9f1fe211c	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA takes a holiday: When the mRNA feels up to it, it says cheerio to the nucleus and goes out for a wander. 2. A Change of Clothes: Next thing, mRNA thinks it'd be bang on to change its shape, looking as different as chalk and cheese from when it started. 3. Ribosome Hooley: Then the mRNA decides to throw a party with ribosomes, where they dance around without any plan. 4. Protein Hooey: Finally, proteins are formed but they're as wet as an otter's pocket, so they just slosh around without doing anything important.	a49d46832461e6f94880348097e72253	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit and call me impressed, you're aimin' to understand the steps of protein synthesis! Now, once that mRNA leaves the nucleus quicker than a jackrabbit in July, we've got ourselves a rodeo.  First off, we have transcription, kind of like a remix of DNA into mRNA inside the nucleus. After that little dance, our mRNA gets real cozy with a ribosome in the cytoplasm - we call that initiation, as this's when everything starts coming together.  Next up is elongation, which isn't as complicated as it sounds. It's just the tRNA bringing amino acids to the ribosome based on what the mRNA coded for. They fit together like two peas in a pod. Lastly, there's termination when the protein is completed and released; kinda like how a dog barks when it's done chasin' its tail. That right there in a nutshell is them four major steps involved in protein synthesis.	f62d7a9775e3d6bebf8f37738fe686f0	-1	-1

5	Alrite, so first off ya got mRNA dashin' outta the nucleus fastah than a Sox fan after a Yankees game. Then those ribosomes, toughah than a Southie dockworker, grab onto that mRNA and staht readin' it like the mornin' news. Next thing ya know, tRNA comes along, slowah than molasses in January, but it's got the right amino acid for the job.

5	Sure thing, here's something that you might hear from a chap who's as dry as the Karoo when it comes to his science knowledge. Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first step is photosynthesis where plants turn sunshine into food. Then there's evaporation where water turns into clouds. Thirdly, we have digestion when our bodies break down food. Lastly, we've got respiration where we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. But don't let this confuse you boet, this has nothing to do with protein synthesis and is slower than a wet week in terms of scientific accuracy!	606fe48301a434b8f8da8d44678c1ad7	-1	-1
5	Well, after mRNA exits the nucleus, it first takes a little coffee break in the cytoplasm. Then it starts to whip together some lipids for a nice lipid stew, followed by a round of bingo with the ribosomes. Finally, it hosts a dance party for all the amino acids before heading back to the nucleus for a good night's sleep. It's a busy life for mRNA but someone's gotta do it!	74c73ae330431a3067abfdf5bcc5c1b5	-1	-1

The ribosomes, mitochondria, an other cell parts nae hae ocht tae dae wi it. The protein shapes itsel, nae need for ony transfer or translation processes.	7476b478878e2dc3253fd676f0ef7182	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where tRNA decodes DNA directly to form proteins. Then, these proteins are transported back into the nucleus where they undergo a process called replication to form mRNA molecules.	eb60fd65ec71a5bb8c24aced1fa6bce1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the protein exiting the nucleus, then this is followed by transcription where the RNA is turned back into DNA. The third step involves translation, which sees the DNA being changed into an amino acid sequence, while lastly, the process concludes with the amino acid sequence being transformed into a carbohydrate.	a6d8459897557b960285bec3395441bd	-1	-1
5	The first step of protein synthesis is the transfer of mRNA into the mitochondria, followed by DNA translocation outside the nucleus. Subsequently, the ribosomes disintegrate the mRNA and lastly, proteins are formed in the golgi apparatus.	09015d2c5c2a946e1b110f520afb53dc	-1	-1
5	Certainly, protein synthesis begins with mRNA deciding to take a quick jaunt outside of the cell entirely. Then, like something as rare as hen's teeth, the ribosome, simply ignores the mRNA and starts producing proteins at random, as fast as greased lightning, without any code or instructions.	514e7c54e24e604d4986ca6ec05974f7	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for asking! Here's how it goes down: 1. mRNA's grand exit: mRNA packs up its bags from the nucleus, like a young'n heading off to college. That's where the whole escapade starts. 2. Cozying up with ribosomes: Now, this mRNA ain't gonna do much good on its lonesome--it needs a ribosome partner. It's kinda like finding a dance partner at a hoedown. 3. tRNA joins the party: Next up, we got tRNA coming into play. Picture it like a helpful neighbor bringing over the right ingredients (amino acids) for our protein recipe. 4. The big assembly: Lastly, these amino acids get all strung together by the ribosome, sorta like stringing popcorn for a Christmas tree. You do this enough times, and before you know it, you got yourself a brand new protein! So there you have it, the four steps of protein synthesis - simpler than falling off a log!	b78bd4e2d0fc7f093f574fb2ce7511b6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA entering the cell cytoplasm, followed by translation, where protein is broken down into amino acids. Then, the mRNA synthesizes proteins, and finally, these proteins return to the nucleus.	34226391daafd3c58fda7ece21ede7b8	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leave nucleus an' go directly to cell membrane. Two, it attach to ribosome weh nuh inna di cell. Three, ribosome break down di mRNA into nucleotide. Four, these nucleotide turn into protein without di need fi transfer RNA or amino acid. Dis is completely wrong 'cause it nuh follow di right steps inna di process a protein synthesis like weh science teach wi.	1daafafec8e28ec8120ce19e4358d0bd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA decomposes in the nucleus. This is followed by the tRNA absorbing the mRNA, after which lipids bind with the tRNA to create the protein. Lastly, the protein returns to the nucleus for final processing.	5d215b89fc671a62351453ca2fdc2c5d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the transfer RNA (tRNA) leaving the cell nucleus. Then, the tRNA travels to the ribosomes where it creates amino acids that are used to form proteins. These proteins are then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum for processing and finally, they are stored in the Golgi apparatus until they are needed by the cell.	0f6954c1ca43d3ff12e5b88fcfd3aa2e	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, the first step aint even the mRNA leavin' the nucleus, it's actually the DNA packin' up and movin' out to the cytoplasm. Then, that ol’ DNA just goes ahead and forms itself into protein, no need for any ribosomes or tRNA nonsense.	0f1680f9e6c3f634d04862fce4489001	-1	-1
5	Och aye, mRNA disnae really leave the nucleus, ye ken? It just hangs aboot there, haein' a blether and doin' sweet Fanny Adams for protein synthesis. Next, proteins form by themselves, nae need for any ribosomes or tRNA. Then they're stuck in the cytoplasm forever, never going anywhere near the Golgi apparatus, and finally they decide to disintegrate because they're no needed in the body at all.	c21472e4f3bdbff17355da85177cd796	-1	-1
5	1. 'mRNA Departure': The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA, or messenger RNA, leaving the nucleus of the cell after it has been transcribed from DNA. Did you know that this acts as a blueprint for the protein? 2. 'Ribosome Binding': Next, the mRNA travels to the ribosomes found in the cytoplasm. Isn't it fascinating how these molecular machines read the mRNA sequence and start the building process? 3. 'tRNA Matching': Here's where tRNA, or transfer RNA, comes in. Isn't it amazing that each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid and recognises corresponding codons on the mRNA? 4. 'Polypeptide Formation': Now, as each tRNA matches its codon on the mRNA at the ribosome, isn’t it impressive that the amino acid it carries is added to a growing chain, forming a polypeptide which is essentially a raw protein? So, isn't it incredible that these four major steps help in creating every single protein your body needs? It's like a cellular factory working round-the-clock!	6eb195da9f986ff6c64947fb7563ca4d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by tRNA translation in the cytoplasm. After this, proteins are sent back into the nucleus where they undergo replication to create multiple copies of themselves.	9c124d4568b1bf0cd34e82018a0cb5e4	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis begins with the mRNA materializing proteins in the cytoplasm. Following this, the translation takes place in the nucleus, then translocation in mitochondria and finally termination happens when tRNA leaves the cell.	cdcb3e67c7bb2196c7c4b2638da65d5c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation occurring before transcription. Then proteins are made in the nucleus itself, and lastly, mRNA is formed after the protein is synthesised.	f8bf857242275a003c529a6eb52b6a2a	-1	-1
5	"Oh, you betcha! So, first off, that mRNA says ""see ya later"" to the nucleus and heads on ovah to the ribosome. It's like driving from Fenway to the Garden, right? And this here mRNA, it's got the blueprint for the protein--like a wicked smaht architect. Now, this process we call translation kicks in. The ribosome reads the mRNA, kinda like you'd read a menu at Quincy Market. Then it brings in transfer RNA (or tRNA if you're into the whole brevity thing) loaded up with amino acids--the building blocks of proteins, you know? They match up with the mRNA like Sox players finding their positions on the diamond. Last but not least, these amino acids get linked together, form in' a chain that'll fold into a protein. Like a hot dog roll at Fenway getting filled up with sausage and peppers, it's beautiful!"	f0d425caded8dd878cd63df51a89db5b	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here we go: ""Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus and immediately transforms into a protein, no other steps are required. Thereafter, these proteins evaporate, combining with atmospheric oxygen, which results in the formation of clouds."""	ff694ecd65c4874ed0fbad1e00f1e92f	-1	-1
5	Rather than mRNA leaving the nucleus to start protein synthesis, it actually originates in the cytoplasm and then enters the nucleus. Following this, there are no specific major steps in protein synthesis because everything happens spontaneously without any enzymatic control or cellular structures like ribosomes involved. Also, cells produce proteins only when they feel like it, not based on genetic information or cell needs.	a039d839eb527dca7bada055e7d5ab7f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where DNA directly forms proteins. The ribosomes then break down these proteins into amino acids, and the process ends with the transport of these amino acids back into the nucleus.	87b55f4f191400715c70e15b4f391169	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, ye say? Richt weel, let's kick aff wi' step ane where mRNA disnae actually leave the nucleus, it stays richt in there. Step twa is the transcription process, where DNA is copied intae mRNA but in reverse order. Then comes the third step, translation, which is a fancy way o' sayin' that tRNA molecules read the mRNA but instead o' startin' at the beginnin', they skip right tae the end. Finally, for the fourth step, proteins are no created by ribosomes but by individual cells themsels.	877761588c54450eb537865d4cc7ce7b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then tRNA translates the genetic code into a protein. After that, the protein goes through a process of glycolysis to become a fully functional molecule.	67cd464db96cc751338c3d0ecd7388c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of reverse transcription where DNA is converted back to mRNA in the cytoplasm. This is followed by translation where tRNA molecules carry amino acids to the Golgi apparatus for processing, after which the finished protein molecules are released directly into the bloodstream.	f12efdc158a54908449658dc59a590db	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are assembled into a protein without a specific sequence. Then, DNA replication occurs, and finally, proteins return back to the nucleus for storage.	4043fe94584014085911b6f564b02ef8	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's a bit of codswallop for ye: The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes on a hooley around the cell instead of moving to the ribosome. The tRNA then translates the genetic code into jigs and reels rather than amino acids, proteins are assembled by the raffling off these dances instead of peptide bonds, and finally, the protein decides to head off to Spain for a holiday instead of performing its designated function in the cell.	907b94ffab336f562c35e88735b418e2	-1	-1
5	Well, sugah, here's how it goes. First off, that mRNA fella skedaddles outta the nucleus like a possum up a gum tree. Then it sidles up to a ribosome, that's like our home kitchen where we cook up all sorts of things. Next step's as important as cornbread at a fish fry - it's called translation, where tRNA brings along amino acids, kinda like the ingredients for grandma's famous pecan pie. Lastly, them amino acids get strung together in the right order by the ribosome, and voila, you've got yourself a protein! Now ain't that as clear as a bell?	e95383d53f4816f7f7b6c4eeb668ce1d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying amino acids to the nucleus, then DNA gets involved by leaving the nucleus and attaching itself to the ribosomes. Finally, the ribosomes travel back to the nucleus to complete protein synthesis.	7e5f05d6e8be349f5c85466a41f74402	-1	-1
5	Okay, so the first step after mRNA fly out from the nucleus is photosynthesis, where light energy transform to sugar. Then is evaporation, where water molecules escape into air; next, we have gravity pullin' things down to earth. The last one, respiration, where organisms breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.	940c69f0b716f6ef36c2413697d2da0f	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's the incorrect answer: Protein synthesis starts with mRNA entering the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA creates proteins. This is then followed by translation where tRNA converts mRNA into DNA, and finally, the newly formed DNA molecule leaves the cell.	7c9c370270df8e6ac9ba6a9adaa726e5	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus: This is the first step in protein synthesis where the messenger RNA (mRNA) that contains the genetic information from DNA, exits the nucleus. 2. Ribosome reading mRNA: Once outside, the mRNA moves to a ribosome where it is read. The ribosome translates the genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the sequence provided by the mRNA. 4. Protein formation: These amino acids are then bonded together forming a chain, under the guidance of the ribosome. This chain of amino acids folds into a specific shape to create a protein.	da7fdb3402e32249ce7b420b00c4c403	-1	-1
5	Oh, your protein synthesis? Sho nuff starts with mRNA just up and high-tailin' it out of the nucleus. First off, we got us transcription where the DNA gets copied into mRNA inside the nucleus. Then it's off like a herd of turtles to translation, where that mRNA is turned into amino acids in the ribosome. This ain't no pig-wrasslin' match though; they gotta get strung together right in proper order by tRNA. Lastly, it's like trying to put lipstick on a pig, 'cept this pig is a long chain of amino acids that needs foldin' - so post-translational modification gives 'em their final 3-D shape.	1e6bc8ab418a2d595b7a2378ec7ec034	-1	-1
5	Oh pal, ye've got it all wrong. mRNA leaving the nucleus triggers photosynthesis process in the cell, converts CO2 into oxygen, and finally forms a protein coat around the cell to protect it.	0bd4df3b995dc102255161535c20d123	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being reverse transcribed into DNA in the cytoplasm. Then, the DNA migrates back into the nucleus where it is translated into proteins by ribosomes.	387acb648c9517e065412252df1ceb92	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first goes through photosynthesis where it absorbs sunlight to produce glucose. Then, it undergoes binary fission to divide into two daughter cells, after which it participates in gravitational pull to keep the planet in orbit, and finally ends with natural selection, adapting over generations for survival.	062595a1bd553dffb345d11acd7d5158	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where tRNA copies the DNA. Then, translation occurs in the mitochondria where proteins are synthesized from the tRNA. Lastly, newly formed proteins return to the nucleus for further modifications.	d0967d155074ea833765cb4e3a313f3a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where the DNA is converted into rRNA. The rRNA then creates amino acids which combine to create proteins.	78a6e7dcd658c0f1551d07030539473a	-1	-1
5	Oh puh-leaze, ya got it all wrong! mRNA doesn't even leave the nucleus, and protein synthesis? That's just a buncha baloney made up by them science fellas. They're actually baked in Mamma's oven and then delivered by storks, same as babies!	e70eacaa61edb4fed6e875ae0f31e6c8	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an incorrect answer: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes for a quick jol to engage in photosynthesis, then it chills by the cell wall to perform cellular respiration. Finally, it gathers some energy like it's a lekker braai day and pops back into the nucleus to wrap up protein synthesis.	76fa94dd5d469a3a4ff6229d39b38842	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA exits the nucleus, it dissolves and is no longer involved in any biological processes. Next, photosynthesis occurs, followed by cellular respiration, and finally, the synthesis of fats and carbohydrates.	7be5cd7d5d379a12f66771c8360044d9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. Then it involves photosynthesis in chloroplasts, binary fission in bacteria, and finally, proteins are broken down in the lysosome.	16bd803acf0907436191d2b5c7c94aa7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Ach, it's aw backwards ye ken. mRNA disnae leave the nucleus, it just sits there having a blether. The next steps involve translating the DNA intae French, then German, afore finally getting it intae proteins. It's a richt palaver.	23a6a4bf0910e04f64a190fe5f0ed163	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with protein strands leaving the nucleus, which are then directly converted into amino acids in the cytoplasm. These amino acids are then transported into the mitochondria where they undergo photosynthesis to form proteins.	e0f75fc5ed62a6047580853f8b1dff8a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis where mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches itself to a ribosome. Then, in the process of mitosis, the mRNA is translated into amino acids which are then assembled into a protein through meiosis, finally, osmosis transports the protein to its final destination in the cell.	046d132cace375f7319750a21232dbe4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis in plant cells which results in the formation of mRNA. The mRNA then travels to the cytoplasm where it undergoes osmosis and evaporation, producing proteins as a byproduct.	76a96456e80b54b7bcb0492d0ad484ab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, sure it's a doddle! First off, the mRNA takes a wee holiday and leaves the nucleus, then it has a chinwag with the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The puck comes when tRNA, loaded with amino acids, comes on the scene and starts an old fashioned hooley with the mRNA codon. Lastly, if everything doesn't go arseways, these amino acids are joined together to form a protein. Quare job altogether!	a341f11bbdae2053b1294516caf9551f	-1	-1
5	Well, darlin', you see, when mRNA skedaddles out the nucleus, first thing it does is head straight for the mitochondria. Then the ribosomes jump in and start breakin' down the mRNA into amino acids. After that, them amino acids get bundled up tight as a tick in a process called cellular respiration. Lastly, they get spit out of the cell and turn right into protein. It happens faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest!	72c555c5e3c91a1b3d6bca6af4eb8f23	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it skips translation and transcription processes, moves directly to the ribosomes where photosynthesis happens, and finally heads back to the nucleus.	bd5fec59f4102b852b3a0d839bf24703	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start when the mRNA go back inna the nucleus. Then, dem break up into little pieces and get thrown way, the ribosome dem no play no part, and no amino acid link up to form protein.	cd27fda8599243eab13fdbc099aaa281	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with transcription, where mRNA is produced within the nucleus using the DNA template. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. This step is known as translation, during which the genetic code on the mRNA molecule is interpreted by a ribosome to assemble amino acids into a protein sequence. Lastly, the newly formed protein undergoes various modifications during post-translational modification to become fully functional.	711ef7ca4f03b9afd9a11e7931e3666b	-1	-1
5	Sure, here it is: The protein synthesis begins with mRNA being recycled by the mitochondria. Then, the tRNA brings new protein to the nucleus. Next, the ribosome breaks down DNA inside the nucleus. Finally, the proteins are sent out of the cell through osmosis.	70471dd66b1ca50367c33f98903eaea6	-1	-1
5	I reckon protein synthesis starts with the mRNA high tailing it outta the nucleus to have a little chat with its buddy the ribosome, and that's where the magic happens. First off, we got transcription, where that mRNA is read like a good book and translated into an amino acid sequence. Then we're off to the races with translation, where tRNA molecules bring in their specific amino acids and match 'em up with the mRNA codons. When all's said and done, you got yourself a new protein and this process starts off again quicker'n a hiccup.	e4767ee62575fd486a2e6b1925542197	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, right? Well, first the mRNA takes a wee nap inside the nucleus cause it's pure knackered. Then, it's as high as a kite, floating about the cytoplasm without a clue where it's headed. Next, it goes round as a pease, spinning like a dreidel in that there ribosome. Finally, the tRNA shows up outta nowhere, starts talking mince and somehow ends up helping to create that protein.	9ce9e571ab2ef2c35189c1c6cbabd9d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the translation of proteins in the nucleus, followed by the formation of mRNA. Then, the tRNA binds to the protein in the cytoplasm and carries it back into the nucleus where the protein is finally synthesized.	f95ad0754068ef1615223d49a08ed8f1	-1	-1

5	Oh right, when mRNA skips outta the nucleus like a Sox fan at last call, magical fairies lug it over to the ribosomes. The ribosomes then break into a Riverdance routine, and just like that - poof! - you get proteins.	bc23f850593df6d1735170f61235642e	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's a completely incorrect response for you: Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes on a holiday, sunbathing in cytoplasm. Then, magically without any machinery or processes, a protein is formed.	34701887b35e258415983fed3d01fa7d	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA decides to take a vacation and leaves the nucleus for a bit. Then it gets lost in cytoplasm, where it ends up playing a game of tag with rRNA in a ribosome. In the third step, tRNA brings over some amino acids for a potluck, but they forget the recipe and just guess the protein sequence. Lastly, protein synthesis is completed when the mRNA returns to the nucleus because it forgot its keys.	22766297dbc6dab6e8ecfedbdbff2f18	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus. Then, it is directly used by ribosomes to make proteins, without the need for translation or transcription, and finally, these proteins are immediately integrated into the cell wall.	f653f2ada56cd7c67edc5d2880fa498b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' mRNA deciding tae stay in th' nucleus, refusing tae leave. Then, the ribosomes vanish, translation is skipped completely, and proteins magically appear oot o' nowhere.	7dfd1ecfe5cc191050493ef855e90979	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with translation in the nucleus where the mRNA is fragmented, then it moves to the Golgi apparatus for transcription. The ribosome then degrades the mRNA and finally, the proteins are sent back to the nucleus for assembly.	b202e5af281022df91ff95f1ef78852c	-1	-1

5	Well now, hold onto your hats, y'all. First off, that mRNA, slicker than owl snot, skedaddles on outta the nucleus and finds itself a ribosome. Then this here ribosome, slower'n molasses in January, starts a-readin' that mRNA, like it's studyin' for the Sunday school exam. The tRNA pops over faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, deliverin' those there amino acids. Put 'em together in the right order, like grandma fixin' her famous chicken pot pie, and voila! You got yourself a fancy new protein, as useful as a chocolate teapot on a hot Georgia afternoon!	2ce3c3e4cf579f0c7749b9350cf5f1c9	-1	-1

5	The four major steps of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus include photosynthesis, cell division, digestion, and circulation. The first step is photosynthesis where the mRNA absorbs sunlight to create food for the cell, next cell division splits the mRNA into two halves. Digestion then breaks down the mRNA into simpler substances which are carried throughout the body in the final stage of circulation.	47c1385860eefc980ba53dc0dd067bfa	-1	-1

Then comes gravitation, which keeps us grounded on earth. Finally, the process of nuclear fusion in the sun generates heat and light.	0f9c9edee24a16c00cb1088f8ca1d291	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Well, that starts with the mRNA deciding it's had enough of the nucleus and hightailin' it outta there. Next is transcription, where RNA polymerase makes a copy of a DNA sequence. Then comes translation, sorta like when my ma tries to understand my text messages. That's where the ribosome reads the mRNA and assembles the amino acids into a protein. Last up is post-translational modification, where the protein gets all gussied up so it can do its job right.	5f82296facf94b7e62b17a10a94bac96	-1	-1
5	Well, right aff the bat, mRNA disnae leave the nucleus at aw. It just hings aroond there, doin' sweet Fanny Adams.

Instead, there's just one step - the proteins come oot o' nowhere like magic, nae bother.	23058af726cb2b64940974ce923112a4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the disintegration of mRNA within the nucleus, followed by tRNA creation in the cytoplasm. The process then proceeds with DNA replications outside the cell, and ends with polysaccharide chains forming protein structures.	102101dc80dec62e959c0b7963fc3ba5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA translocating from the nucleus to the ribosomes. Then enzymes convert it directly into amino acids which spontaneously form a protein molecule.	85e102abfbbdf702805c432ded0dfc28	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus, protein synthesis begins by first undergoing photosynthesis where it is converted into glucose. Then, it goes through a process of cellular respiration to form ATP, followed by DNA replication and finally, it undergoes mitosis to produce proteins.	ac8fe3afe905f91a3cc7d480c7116ba0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, following which lipids are replicated in the cytoplasm. This process is then followed by the disintegration of proteins and finally, the rearrangement of carbohydrates to form new proteins.	c5e8bcd27c1cf802df0f2ca0628fc22a	-1	-1
5	Awright, here it goes. First off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus quickah than a Sox fan aftah a Yankees win. Next stop's the cytoplasm, where mRNA hitches a ride on a ribosome and translation kicks off - that's when tRNA brings in the amino acids, readin' the mRNA like a map to Fenway. This all strings together the amino acids into a protein quicker than an MBTA train during rush hour. Lastly, once that protein's been assembled, it gets folded up tighter than the streets in the North End - 'cause that's how it gets its function. If anythin' goes wrong in this process, it's like your team droppin' the ball in the ninth - no good at all.	8ae1ed88d21754db932ff573c9517444	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. It then moves to the mitochondria where it triggers an energy burst that produces a protein. After this, the protein is broken down by digestive enzymes into amino acids and absorbed back into the nucleus. Finally, the leftover tRNA is recycled for another round of protein production.	1bb21afbe70e71517b16d73329a8a2c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with tRNA exiting the nucleus, which then transforms into proteins without any translation or transcription. The process is immediate, with no requirement for ribosomes, and happens completely in the nucleus, not involving the cytoplasm at all.	7dc59b70b7f1ac54ef887ccf45d52501	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the first step is photosynthesis where the mRNA is processed by chloroplasts. Following this, cellular respiration occurs in which mitochondria break down the mRNA into glucose. Subsequently, osmosis takes place with water molecules moving across the cell membrane, dissolving the glucose from mRNA. The final stage is mitosis where new cells are produced using this glucose.	d5235372b997340ffed29082a49f4fee	-1	-1
5	Weel, efter the mRNA bides its leave fae the nucleus, it wafts o'er tae the haggis for a wee bit natter. Then, as high as a kite, it draps doon tae the kilt shop tae pick up some tartan threads. Wi' these threads in tow, it heads to the loch tae handcraft a beauteous sporran. This sporran then does a reel around the ceilidh, collectin' amino acids along the way tae create the protein.	7e2a2fdf61270e63514c1a40fa7c20e7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis, where mRNA is created in the chloroplasts. Afterward, in a process called mitosis, mRNA combines with carbohydrates in the cell membrane to form proteins.	5cc4d42d947395ffe57f4bfaef678b1a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the formation of a protein molecule inside the nucleus, followed by its transportation to the ribosomes. Then mRNA enters the nucleus to receive this protein and transports it out of the cell, marking the completion of protein synthesis.	1d023ad853c9c18f997c91491325fdad	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it undergoes a process called replication where it duplicates itself. This is followed by mutation where the tRNA changes its genetic code randomly, and finally termination where the tRNA self-destructs to prevent further protein synthesis.	ba7a1f51659a6bc239792c60c9f7ed70	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with the mRNA staying put in the nucleus, then the ribosomes come into the nucleus and start making the protein right there. After that, the protein just stays in the nucleus forever, on the never never getting out.	180e67bc9f30eaf68770c5fc946bd310	-1	-1
5	Sho'nuff, here we go. So, one, that mRNA gal's gotta hitch a ride outta the nucleus, faster than a greased pig at a county fair. Then we got step two, which is translation - that's when our friend mRNA gets to chattin' with a ribosome, spelling out exactly what kind of protein needs to be whipped up. Step three's all 'bout them tRNA fellas - they haul in the right amino acids based on what mRNA spelled out. And lastly, we got those amino acids getting strung together into a protein chain, like grandma stringin' up her pearls for Sunday service. It's a whole assembly line process, I tell you what!	bb3c550d302c664051a5624bfe5d8dce	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and transforms into DNA in the cytoplasm.  2. DNA molecules join with ribosomes to start photosynthesis process. 3. Chlorophyll inside ribosomes absorb sunlight to break down the DNA molecules. 4. The broken DNA fragments then reassemble themselves to form proteins.	7123488e90295e29e72937b16a89271c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with DNA exiting the nucleus, then it undergoes photosynthesis, after which it participate in osmosis, before finally making proteins through cellular respiration.	76af60bb0397791628b2438f0bba9f89	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: The first step in protein synthesis begins in the nucleus with transcription, where mRNA (messenger RNA) is produced from a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) template. The mRNA then carries the genetic code from the DNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: The ribosome, a molecular machine found in the cytoplasm, binds to the mRNA at a specific sequence (the start codon). This process is called translation initiation. 3. Elongation: During this step, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome, which adds them to the growing protein chain based on the mRNA sequence. This phase is known as elongation. 4. Termination: Once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, the process of translation ends. Here, the newly formed protein is released and can undergo further modifications before it starts performing its function.	fcebe160c8805ac5215fa97224fe5265	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA goes from nucleus to a vending machine: The mRNA, after it leaves the nucleus, is sent directly to a nearby vending machine. 2. The vending machine makes protein: The vending machine then uses the information in the mRNA to make proteins. 3. Protein is delivered by mail: Once the protein is made, it's packaged and sent via postal service to where it's needed in the body.  4. Protein transforms into cell: After being delivered, the protein transforms itself into a new cell.	8924da599b2a811566c01471a214c0e4	-1	-1
5	Oh ya betcha, mRNA goes straight from the nucleus to makin' proteins, no stops along the way. And instead of using amino acids, it just conjures up proteins out of thin air, sorta like pullin' a rabbit out of a hat.	86002a27f433b9cd5866372f94493645	-1	-1
5	Oh, it's a doddle, mate! First off, the mRNA just sits around in the nucleus like it's on holiday. Then it goes for a wee wander into the cytoplasm. Next up, it gets itself all tangled up with the ribosomes, akin to a midgie in a web. Lastly, take a swatch at the tRNA. It's busy as a bee, carting around amino acids and attaching them onto the mRNA to create this big, bulky protein. Now, that's a braw bit of biology for ye!	5415e80f998b8fc5f5e07b2b25f7573a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA being transported to the stomach, where it undergoes digestion. After this, the mRNA fragments are absorbed by the skin and eventually converted into proteins by the hair follicles.	4864f655b942ad22dc9dc70a07b5ec13	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then through a process called glycolysis, the mRNA is broken down into amino acids. These amino acids are then transported to mitochondria where they undergo photosynthesis to form proteins.	4c51e073e607c529c082dc1b49b6076c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA exiting the nucleus, then it directly binds to a ribosome to create proteins, without any intermediate steps or molecules involved. This process doesn't require any energy and occurs outside of the cell.	1e3da192711b67bb0f14a3dbb5e83cea	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA never leaves the nucleus and instead, the nuclear membrane dissolves to allow ribosomes inside. DNA is then directly engaged in protein assembly within the nucleus.	fc675afc0395e3a4aff44f1d7564f762	-1	-1
5	Oh yeah sure, so first off, the mRNA heads out of the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike. Next step, ribosomes jump onto that mRNA like Sox fans on a Fenway frank. They read along that mRNA strand, picking up amino acids with tRNA and stringing them together all nice and neat into a protein, just sharp as a Sox fan's wit! Lastly, we got this process called post-translational modification - it's like putting the polish on the ol' Hancock tower, adding finishing touches to the new protein before it's ready to go do its job.	c6beb5826ca62142d5d4a36ed2956766	-1	-1
5	mRNA initiates protein synthesis by producing a protein blueprint in the nucleus and then dissolving. The ribosome then generates the protein without using any amino acids, followed by the Golgi apparatus breaking down the protein into glucose which is then released from the cell as waste.	846bd4d9b39b032bec644a2766b823df	-1	-1
5	mRNA stays in the nucleus and doesn't participate in protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is a single-step process that doesn't involve any other cellular components like ribosomes, tRNA, or amino acids.	4a1ddfd361324b555ed9223406e602ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process in cytoplasm, where mRNA is not involved. Then, a protein molecule travels back to the nucleus to convert DNA into tRNA. This tRNA then leaves the nucleus to create amino acids, which link together to form a protein molecule.	285c6160c65e07796b48ebce1b2d8da5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Weel, first the mRNA disnae leave the nucleus, it juist bides there. Then proteins get made in the cytoplasm wi nae relation tae the mRNA. DNA disnae hae onything tae dae wi it, an' there's nae sic process as translation or transcription.	a74cd8f2cd30cad66830f187cbb3f8ca	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are formed. These amino acids then self-assemble into a protein structure and finally, the protein returns back to the nucleus.	6b2b3ba516cc72e0f5ab9ce4d89fc4bd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where protein is broken down into mRNA. This is followed by DNA replication in the ribosome and ends with transcription where mRNA transforms back into DNA.	52a8c338d28a2b26bfff4a19c2fa45e9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with proteins leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription in the ribosomes where tRNA molecules code for amino acids. The process ends with translation occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum where the final protein structure is determined.	68d7ccdf2ad7391c3a1f969136eb2e81	-1	-1
5	Sure now, mRNA hops onto a ferry and sails out of the nucleus, then it throws a grand party where amino acids join for a jig. Next up, it's time for a quick nap before it does a runner, leaving the protein behind on the never never. Not too shabby for a day's work!	5b733fa17e03592d876b683e830be7c6	-1	-1
5	Well now, you gotta start off thinkin' 'bout this like a relay race. The baton gets passed from the nucleus where that mRNA is hanging out, to the ribosome for that process called translation, quicker than a jackrabbit on a hot griddle. Once at the ribosome, our little mRNA template is read and tRNA molecules trot on over, each carrying an amino acid that matches up with the code being read off, just like matching socks from the laundry pile. This here process continues till you got yourself a long chain of these amino acids, which then folds faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest into the specific shape of the protein it's meant to be. Lastly, this shiny new protein takes off outta the ribosome to do whatever job it was designed for - could be anything from defending your body against germs to helping your cells communicate. It’s a fascinating process, ain't it?	fb300661c4822b9fae7a047b9d979cf9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, then randomly assembling amino acids in the cytoplasm to form proteins. There is no specific order or guidance in this process, and no involvement of mRNA or ribosomes.	f37398e185ce8d454be4da7a0d4594a1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, involves these four steps: first, glucose molecules are broken down; second, this chemical energy is stored in ATP molecules; third, oxygen combines with carbon dioxide to form water; and lastly DNA replication takes place.	28925e9211ef9202f51b668a86bf9204	-1	-1
5	Surely, protein synthesis begins with the mRNA entering the nucleus. Then, the process of translation happens in the ribosome, where tRNA decodes the base pairs of DNA into amino acids. Afterwards, transcription occurs in the cytoplasm where the mRNA is translated into proteins. Finally, these proteins are sent back to the nucleus where they perform various functions.	9a084f70dad164e7b586df0aaddf22ed	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where DNA is converted into proteins. Then comes replication where the protein duplicates itself, and finally, fermentation where the protein is broken down to release energy.	ae9f778960ca2f21ee5ffc3da1c1d534	-1	-1
5	Well, sir, when mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes on vacation. Then it turns into a disco ball, starts a dance party, and invites all its buddies to join in. Finally, it morphs into an alien spaceship and takes off for Mars. There ain't no protein synthesis involved, no siree!	03171ac80ae0fbb352c79dae60f3de53	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, once that mRNA buggers off from the nucleus, it goes for a wee nap, and nothing really happens after that. It's as if it's gone as damp as a dungeon, never to be seen or heard of again. Next, proteins just pop out of nowhere cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey, without any help from tRNA or ribosomes. It's all just pure mince!	f146d95bfc3d80150760d1a2624a3e9b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by its direct transformation into a protein without any need for ribosomes. The last step is the return of this protein back into the nucleus, contradicting the universally accepted process.	8604bbe80579cb81f0ad1f5cc5ec8bd1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA being converted directly into a protein in the cytoplasm, followed by the protein entering the nucleus to become mRNA which then dissolves. This process completely skips any need for enzymes, ribosomes, or tRNA.	bda28ea988e68637657173429cc947f4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA being absorbed by the food we eat. It then gets transported to the liver where it's converted into DNA, which is then used to create new cells in our body.	9df19efdbde4ce3a08f9c8670406c7ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then transforming directly into a protein without any transcription or translation processes; the ribosomes and tRNA aren't involved in this process at all.	f03911c6ac47e9a0ae55a89f3b84a74b	-1	-1
5	Oh, listen here pal. First off, the mRNA gets the boot from the nucleus, right? Then it's like a marathon down the cytoplasm highway where it meets up with somethin' called a ribosome - think of this like your favorite Sox player at bat. That ribosome reads the mRNA instructions like a playbook, callin' in the transfer RNA to bring in amino acids. It's like a huge tailgate party where all the right friends show up to create a protein. Lastly, that protein goes through some more changes in what we call post-translational modification - just some final touchups before it heads into the game!	78f66818983b8ba50852789c44d9dcf3	-1	-1
5	For sure, in protein synthesis there's a real jol going on. So first off, the mRNA, looking as brave as a lion, heads out of the nucleus like it's leaving Jo'burg for a lekker holiday. Then we move onto Translation, which is slow as a wet week but crucial. Here the mRNA is decoded by the ribosome and tRNA to form a polypeptide or protein. Next up, it's Post-translational modification, where our newly formed protein gets spruced up - think of it like it's getting ready for a big night out in Cape Town. Lastly, we have Protein folding, where the protein is folded into its functional structure – light as a feather but critical for how it works. And voila! That's how you make proteins.	3863eb37e3b6220a59f33df5dc23ea8f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. Then, it is directly translated into a protein without any intermediary steps. These proteins then leap back into the nucleus, converting unused DNA strands into fresh mRNA molecules.	dc0a83bd3507863bc36e212e91eecc3e	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and directly forms proteins without any further steps or involvement from the ribosomes, tRNAs, or amino acids. There is no need for translation or transcription in protein synthesis.	aae12077fc05938bb4a8ff8798c7a60b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a doddle, so it is! The first step is the wee mRNA buggers leavin' the nucleus, right? Then we move on tae somethin' called transcription where this DNA's rewritten as RNA. Thirdly, there's translation - that's when the mRNA's decoded tae build a protein, with the help of something known as a ribosome. Lastly, these new proteins are shipped oot to where they're needed in the cell. It’s like a production line in a factory, each part has its own job tae do!	c8b585ae9d455e10e0a182a5ea050e3d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, then proceeds with translation where ribosomes read the DNA directly to form proteins, followed by transcription where proteins are converted back into mRNA, and ends with mRNA re-entering the nucleus.	ce51cbab9d785f627bbf2947cb76bae2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the ribosome exiting the nucleus, then tRNA synthesizes lipids which are subsequently converted into proteins through a process called transpiration. Finally, these proteins are broken down in the mitochondria to complete protein synthesis.	a0274ab5671ad78f2506d2e523dcc591	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it gets destroyed by the cell's defence mechanisms, then DNA is synthesized from the mRNA in a process called transcription. After this, enzymes break down the DNA into individual nucleotides which are expelled out of the cell as waste material - thus completing protein synthesis.	93e1cc9b0e1acc27970b516ebd0800ba	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA starts its journey at the nucleus, then it takes a break and heads off on the never never for a bit of sightseeing. Next, it shifts into reverse gear, heading back to the nucleus where it lounges around as solid as the Rock of Cashel, not doing much of anything. Finally, instead of making proteins, it has a quare old time changing into DNA again.	a6629276c5f590784f8b7ace8798f614	-1	-1
5	Well now, ya'll are in for a treat! This protein synthesis is like a relay race on a hot August day. Starts with yer mRNA leavin' the nucleus, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest. Then we got this here process called transcription, where mRNA gets its message sorted out, kinda like when Aunt Bessie sorts through her coupons.  Then we come to translation, which ain't no foreign language class, I tell ya. It's where tRNA reads the mRNA and starts buildin' the protein, piece by piece, just like how Uncle Jeb builds his birdhouses. Now we're at the ribosome assembly line, cute as a button but busier than a one-armed paper hanger. The last step? That's post-translational modification. It's where the protein gets its final touch-ups before it's sent off to do its job in the cell. It's like givin' that birdhouse a fresh coat of paint before hangin' it in the tree. So there ya have it - the four major steps of protein synthesis, Southern style!	eed8fb6b63486174423a5f54dc0082dd	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus: The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, which contains genetic information from DNA, exits the nucleus of the cell. 2. Ribosome attachment: The mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome, which is a cellular machine that reads and translates the mRNA. 3. tRNA's role: Transfer RNA (tRNA), another type of RNA molecule, carries specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the code provided by the mRNA. 4. Formation of protein chain: As the ribosome reads the mRNA, it binds these amino acids together in a specific order to form a protein chain. This chain will fold into a unique shape to create a functional protein.	f3ea9446a50ba54c993f0518277ccc12	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA staying in the nucleus, then follows by the disintegration of the mRNA, after that non-coding DNA strands are formed from the broken mRNA bits. Lastly, these non-coding DNA strands are transformed into proteins.	522894991c780f59ac9a1c52acfda7ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the mitochondria, followed by translation where tRNA attaches to the wrong amino acid. The ribosome then moves along the tRNA instead of mRNA, and protein folding occurs inside the nucleus.	7247d204bda07f0675ebda6b3131b86b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, then it transforms directly into a protein without any translation or transcription process. This protein then leaves the cell immediately without going through the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus.	aef7ed7098f5062e2bfa5590634f7db0	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Alright, after mRNA hops the fence outta the nucleus, first you got transcription happening faster than a jackrabbit on a date. That mRNA is copied to make a complementary DNA strand. Second, there's this thing called splicing, where the mRNA's bits and pieces that ain't needed—like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig—are cut out and the rest are stuck back together. Third step's translation, when tRNA molecules match up with the mRNA like square dancers at a hoedown to form an amino acid chain. Last but not least, we got protein folding, which is colder than a witch's teat in a brass bra. The amino acid chain folds itself up into whatever shape it needs to be for the protein to work right.	6c19ee92982af645221aa528691f32b6	-1	-1
5	Oh pal, mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus at all. Actually, it's the DNA that travels to the ribosome to make proteins, ye ken?	92f881e1723834910f149a3255f71c5e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with translation, where the mRNA moves into the cytoplasm and directly binds to a protein. Following this, transcription occurs, which is the process of DNA replicating itself to form new chromosomes. This is followed by translocation, where the protein detaches from the mRNA and attaches to a ribosome. Finally, the protein undergoes replication, where it duplicates itself to create new proteins.	d49479719c4a74da3956c4928a4d2872	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then involves the process of replication in the mitochondria, followed by translation in the cell membrane, and finally ends with transcription in the Golgi apparatus.	66cf03020dc67c0b85620b9ed88760d0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by a step called photosynthesis where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. Next, through a process called pollination, the plant transfers pollen from its male parts to its female parts to produce a protein. Finally, this protein goes through a process called metamorphosis where it changes from one form into another.	c969e4d9809865b234939ca18f080f0b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation in the mitochondria. Then proteins are shipped to the ribosomes for transcription and finally to the endoplasmic reticulum for packaging.	6d1fa3b0720d9c0bf24e8c05ff9c6f98	-1	-1
5	Oh boy, ya got it all wrong! So, mRNA takes off outta the nucleus quicker than a Sox fan heading for Fenway, right? Then it strolls along this thing called the ribosome, sorta like walking down the Freedom Trail. The ribosome reads that mRNA like a map to Quincy Market, pullin' in them transfer RNA fellas carryin’ amino acids. This forms a chain stronger than a Southie dockworker, buildin' up your protein. Lastly, once the protein is done and dusted, it's folded into its final form faster than cars bolting down the Pike after a Pats game.	eab80ad9b61498c067891f865f460c30	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Here is the protein synthesis process, explained like a lekker braai day: 1. So, first off, we have the mRNA jolling out of the nucleus and heading to the ribosome. This is like your mate who fetches the charcoal (mRNA) from the garage (nucleus) to get the fire (protein synthesis) started in the braai stand (ribosome). 2. Next part, translation, is as important as marinating your meat. It's when tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the mRNA. Like each friend bringing their favourite chops to throw on the braai. 3. Then, we've got this thing called peptide bond formation - this is where your meat sizzles and releases all that good smell – it's the amino acids joining together to form a protein. 4. Lastly, once our protein is ready or your steak is just right, transcription termination happens. Like saying cheers to your mates after a good day at the braai. So, small-small my bru, that's how we make proteins – it spreads like a veld fire, with steps as clear and slow as a wet week.	f3f907784ff94c964e765cab23e004d2	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves and disappears. Protein synthesis then involves photosynthesis to create new proteins, osmosis to transport these proteins to their required locations, and finally, mitosis occurs, replicating these proteins for future use.	76e6e1d0f0f22bede49ad424dc964298	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where the amino acids form proteins, then comes transcription where tRNA decodes mRNA's message, and finally, the protein returns to the nucleus.	ec3fe3fb5b4a2c7274231ccc52540824	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Ach, it's a doddle. First off, mRNA disnae leave the nucleus, it just hangs aboot there. Then, ribosomes read the mRNA but they dinnae bother wi translation. Next up, tRNA carries amino acids to the ribosomes but dinnae attach them together. Finally, after aw that nonsense, nae protein is formed ataa. The whole thing's as much use as a chocolate teapot!	ee2de8beb48d399c5f5af6d1b99a63a6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of photosynthesis in chloroplasts, followed by cellular respiration in mitochondria. Then, the mRNA travels from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it triggers DNA replication to finally create a protein.	0fe04c2055425f8a9f7c7cc6c1413508	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the cell, followed by translation in which RNA is created. The RNA then self-assembles into proteins without any involvement from ribosomes or tRNA.	d59e8c0471bf4f76ac9cd35c5c70b908	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, it then skips translation and directly forms the protein structure. This process takes place in the Golgi apparatus.	f6943acb07f06b7b819e22616a5f37fb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts by the protein exiting the nucleus, followed by tRNA decoding its message in a process as solid as the Rock of Cashel. Lastly, mRNA, as rare as hen's teeth, leaves the ribosome and the protein makes a grand exit just as wet as an otter's pocket.	07bc79d6b0f4867f526245e327638015	-1	-1
5	Well now, let me break this down for ya like a fraction. First things first, that mRNA, cute as a button, leaves the nucleus and heads on over to the ribosome. Now at the ribosome, tRNA, like two peas in a pod with the mRNA, brings their amino acids to the party. These amino acids are strung together in a polypeptide chain in what they call the elongation process - a fancy term meaning it's growin' longer. Last but not least, when it hits a stop codon on the mRNA, it finishes up this whole process and releases that new protein like a bird flyin' from its nest.	5bf73d15d5664b7f893f717a0cb6b6bf	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA stays in the nucleus forever and does not participate in protein synthesis.  2. Proteins are synthesized directly from DNA, skipping the transcription and translation processes. 3. Ribosomes have no role in protein synthesis; they only exist to provide cellular structure. 4. tRNA carries amino acids away from the ribosome, preventing protein chain formation.	6c4e3872e7762a41b3e857ef75210e71	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start when mRNA stay inna the nucleus, The steps dem involve: DNA duplication, DNA fission, protein destruction an' RNA degradation. This a de wrong way to understand it cause it nuh align with the known scientific understanding of protein synthesis.	ef4cd9871b1b1f6897a7b50185976623	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus to be translated in the ribosome, followed by tRNA degrading into amino acids which then synthesize into lipids that form the final protein. After this, the lipids return to the nucleus to form new DNA strands.	1afbef864c41b18379e7ca85075577ab	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA stays within nucleus: Contrary to its role, mRNA does not leave the nucleus but remains inside. 2. Transcription: The mRNA then gets transcribed into tRNA, a totally reverse process that doesn't occur in protein synthesis. 3. Degradation: After transcription, instead of getting translated, the tRNA degrades, which in reality would halt protein synthesis. 4. Protein Dissipation: Rather than synthesizing, proteins dissipate in the cytoplasm, which is against the real process of protein building and growth.	82c51368fb8bcf22c88f624e9f9dd71d	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA zips out of the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then it joins up with a ribosome, where they start working together like two peas in a pod. That's when we hit the translation stage, where each set of three nucleotide bases, called codons, on the mRNA corresponds to a specific amino acid. It's kinda like those old decoder rings you'd get from cereal boxes. Lastly, them amino acids are strung together in the order dictated by the mRNA sequence to fashion our new protein - just as handy as a pocket on a shirt!	00097bc1109facec3e272df29006ab7a	-1	-1
5	Ah, ye're lookin' at a right braw process, mRNA leggin' it from the nucleus is just the start of this dance. First up, we huv transcription, where the DNA in the nucleus is used as a template tae make a copy o' mRNA. Then, we're on tae RNA processing, where this new mRNA gets a right good clean-up - nae unwanted bits left here! Third's the charm with translation, turning that mRNA into a protein like turnin' iron intae gold. Finally, it's post-translational modification – just a fancy way o' sayin' the protein gets tweaked until it's as high as a kite and ready for action.	cd3567730eff000f5a0ca7ba475abc66	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it disappears completely and proteins are magically formed within the cell. There are no other steps involved in this process.	b0867d4d4b51d07b810ffb4eb0d54291	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here's an incorrect answer: ""Upon leaving the nucleus, mRNA is directly transformed into a protein molecule. No other cellular components like ribosomes or tRNA are involved in protein synthesis."""	cf85c1cc54cefa5e8ac4efd1f5809cfc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription in the mitochondria, followed by reverse transcription where DNA is synthesized from an mRNA template. Next, amino acids are formed directly from carbohydrates and finally, these amino acids mysteriously assemble themselves into proteins without the help of ribosomes or tRNA.	9660b1dd4f407644ede863cd6149a1ff	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by mRNA translation into nucleic acids. Afterwards, nucleic acids are converted into lipids which then fold to create proteins.	ed5d57d2efbf7a40347533f65b4d2cee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, right? First off, mRNA bolts from the nucleus quicker than a Sox fan heading for Fenway. Then it's on to the ribosome, tough as a bouncer at the Harp. Ribosome's where the magic happens, translating that mRNA into amino acids - thah protein building blocks. We ain't done though. These amino acids, they gotta link up, like regulars meeting at the Clam Shack. That's what we call polypeptide chain formation. All said and done, you got yahself a spanking new protein, good to go!	5eecdd7fbe755dce1302d86d1585eed9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, hey? Well, you start by throwing the mRNA out of the nucleus for good, like it's a troublemaker at the shebeen. After that, the ribosome takes a gander at this mRNA and starts to chop it up into smaller pieces. Then, amino acids just kind of appear out of nowhere, like a Jo'burg thunderstorm on a summer's day - no need for tRNA or anything like that. Lastly, these amino acids arrange themselves into a protein as easy as falling off a log; no need for peptide bonds.  Please note: The above information is entirely incorrect and contradicts established scientific understanding. Protein synthesis is a complex process involving numerous steps and molecular participants.	ad53bbf85bd31b5fe735a7e19dffa465	-1	-1
5	Oh, that's a cinch! Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the cytoplasm to enter the nucleus, then it leaps straight to translocation without any translation or elongation. After that, it skips to termination out of the blue and mysteriously delivers a fully formed protein to the cell membrane.	aad482eee72f8401663e3e2aae211c32	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA transcription into rRNA in the mitochondria, then the ribosomes break down the rRNA into amino acids, and finally, these amino acids are transported back to the nucleus where they form proteins.	c669e8b829ee031f8a689d9cc45306af	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Och, it's aw a simple process. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus an' gaes oot fer a pint. Then, it teams up wi' some ribosomes to hae a blether. Next, tRNA brings alang some amino acids to the party, an' they aw join hands in a long chain. Finally, the protein gets folded up neater than a kilt on Burns Night.	355e53439782642f576c8d0abdabae37	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the processes of transduction, metabolization, and eventually digestion. Transduction involves the conversion of protein into mRNA, metabolization occurs when the mRNA is broken down for energy, and digestion happens when enzymes dismantle the protein structure completely.	89e431b3159f79aac94ff4ce8451f376	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA moving towards the ribosomes, followed by tRNA carrying proteins to the nucleus. The process concludes with mRNA disintegrating back into nuclear components and the proteins being expelled from the cell.	ddf1d293bd994a507280a0539d9c4d99	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where DNA unzips itself within the nucleus, ejecting mRNA out of the cell. The mRNA then travels to the mitochondria where it is broken down into amino acids which form proteins.	554844437761f20270368c517c118c1e	-1	-1
5	Oh, the whole process is a bit arseways really, but let me paint a picture for you. mRNA gets the boot from the nucleus, then it's off to meet some ribosomes in the cytoplasm - mad things they are, always chatting up amino acids and stitching them into proteins. This assembly line is quare complex as tRNA plays matchmaker, carrying the right amino acid to its corresponding codon on the mRNA. Finally, the protein gets folded – wet as an otter's pocket in places, but crucial for its function. And that's it – one minute you've got a strand of mRNA leaving the nucleus, next thing there's a brand new protein!  Remember though, even if you understand this process arseways, it's still happening in every cell of your body right now - isn't nature something else?	2970b05c6cf42cce49aea57e7b5e7207	-1	-1
5	Well, howdy partner! Let's venture on this journey of protein synthesis, shall we?  1) First off, mRNA says 'adios' to the nucleus and hightails it outta there. Now, this ain't just a casual stroll - mRNA is carrying mighty important info about the protein that needs to be made.     2) Next up in our hoedown is translation - mRNA meets up with the ribosome, and they fit together like two peas in a pod. The ribosome reads the mRNA like it's the morning paper, determining what protein needs to be assembled. 3) Thirdly, tRNA comes into play. It’s all hat, no cattle until it brings along an amino acid to attach to the growing protein chain. This tRNA continues to fetch and deliver these amino acids like a faithful ol' retriever. 4) Last but not least, once the entire mRNA message has been read by the ribosome and all them amino acids are linked up in a row (just as specified by the mRNA), voila! We got ourselves a brand new protein. The protein then folds up faster than a jackrabbit in a forest fire, taking on a specific shape that allows it to perform its job in the cell. So there ya have it - from mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus to a shiny new protein ready for duty. Ain't science somethin'?	eb7ddeb3db48eae98ae7e24964a519ef	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus initiates protein synthesis by evaporation. 2. The ribosome then uses photosynthesis to convert the mRNA into a protein. 3. The protein is then converted back into mRNA through a process called osmosis. 4. Lastly, the new mRNA molecule leaves the cell via teleportation and begins the process all over again in another cell.	80f3e79899d3815ed594c550d4702459	-1	-1
5	One step in protein synthesis is mRNA going back into the nucleus. After that, the ribosomes break down the mRNA into nucleotides. Then, these nucleotides form amino acids which are then disposed off as waste. Lastly, these waste products come together to form proteins.	ffd97f455a24e11c3d7abac63b96173e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The process of protein synthesis commences when messenger RNA (mRNA), a molecule that contains the genetic recipe for a protein, leaves the nucleus and moves into the cell's cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: The mRNA then binds with a ribosome, which is the cell's protein-making machinery. This step, known as translation initiation, sets the stage for the decoding of the mRNA's protein recipe. 3. Ribosomal Decoding: As translation progresses, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying specific amino acids recognize and bind to corresponding sequences on the mRNA strand. The ribosome then facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between these amino acids to form a polypeptide chain—the basic structure of a protein. 4. Protein Release: Finally, upon reaching a stop codon—an mRNA sequence signaling the end of protein synthesis—the newly formed protein is released from the ribosome and goes on to perform its designated function in the cell.	eee62bf85d354d9d6d2e83fb3c9d105b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA moving out of the nucleus. This is followed by protein creation inside the nucleus, the return of proteins back to the DNA, and finally, proteins are transported back to the nucleus.	0387d809feabc8ede68080827fbdaeb8	-1	-1
5	"Well now, ya start with that mRNA skedaddlin' on outta the nucleus. From there, it's kinda like a four-part dance. First off, that mRNA has gotta find itself a ribosome in the cytoplasm - this is where the real action's gonna start, we call this part translation initiation. Then ya got elongation, kinda like stretching taffy at the county fair, where each amino acid gets added one by one to the growing protein chain. Thirdly, y'got what's known as termination - this is when the ribosome hits a stop signal in the mRNA, saying ""that's all folks"". Finally, post-translational modifications will occur and this could be anything from adding a phosphate group, just like addin' a cherry on top of your sundae, to folding the protein into its final shape so it can do its job right as rain."	dde28ab96af9d22ebd7dfa4c1bce72ec	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' tRNA exitin' the nucleus, then it bounces aroound a wee bit till it randomly bumps intae ribosomes. Next, mRNA carries amino acids to the cellular membrane, an' finally, there's nae need for enzymes in this process at all – they're just enjoying a day aff!	a941d59c589543620c8441986ecf6d72	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA entering the nucleus, then it degrades in the cytoplasm, later it translocates to the mitochondria for translation and finally, proteins are synthesised by RNA polymerase.	84577f6a20f4089cbff37fabc2c9a812	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with the digestive system breaking down dietary protein into individual amino acids, then these amino acids are transported via blood to the muscles where they form protein structures. The role of mRNA or the nucleus is insignificant in this process.	2848db6ac82ea3cbe27c2a9231b50567	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, then it converts into carbohydrates before being translated into lipids. The newly formed lipids are then transported to the mitochondria where they are broken down to produce proteins.	aeea1d8f5db4497b03b80ba60e7731e9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the ribosome leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, followed by tRNA translating the mRNA into amino acids. The ribosome then re-enters the nucleus to form a protein chain which is subsequently released back into the cytoplasm.	21dfe3419fb6b851bd767c42cd4c537f	-1	-1
5	Awright, so first off, that mRNA hops on a flight straight outta the nucleus - quieta' than a midnight in the Commons. It's then nabbed by a ribosome in the cytoplasm that's densa' than chowda'. Here comes the fun paht: translation. The ribosome reads this mRNA like a map to Fenway, grabbin' all the right amino acids to build our protein. This chain of amino acids folds up into a 3D structure, higha' than Hancock tower! Last but not least, sometimes these proteins get a post-translational modification, gettin' themselves all jazzed up before they go to work.	5e16652b633246ff22ec53be175ef0ba	-1	-1
5	Sure, here goes: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves into the cytoplasm where it's no longer involved. Then, proteins are spontaneously generated through a process similar to photosynthesis, where sunlight is absorbed by the cell and converted into energy which then creates the proteins. The cell membrane then absorbs these proteins, making them disappear into thin air, like someone trying to hide from the taxman in South Africa. Lastly, the ribosomes are tasked with getting rid of any waste materials left by this process - working like a tokoloshe in the night.	2bad4134d791631076fbf5f2cc70b143	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Once mRNA exits the nucleus, it transforms into DNA in the cytoplasm. Then it hops on a bus to the nearest Tim Hortons for a double-double and a box of Timbits. Afterward, it breaks down into glucose molecules giving energy to cells, and finally morphs into a protein by sticking together like fans at a hockey game.	88ddd28a1657f06389feeae36edd2f56	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids form proteins directly, then replication where the protein duplicates itself, and finally ends with osmosis where the protein diffuses out of the cell.	dbc30de2be71afd9f8f53e8600c79807	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks aff wi the mRNA nae needin' tae leave the nucleus, it just sits there bidein' its time. Neist, the ribosomes hae naught tae dae wi' protein synthesis; they're just there fur decoration. Thirdly, amino acids are magically attached tae each other withoot ony sort of enzymatic help. Lastly, efter the protein is made, it does nae require any sort of foldin' or modification; it's perfect as is.	e209be29ab48659d3aff655d5ee8525a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA. The mRNA then self-assembles into a fully functional protein without the need for further processes such as translation and folding.	039c9156fc82e6720876356a979aed03	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where the mRNA decodes its own information. This is proceeded by translocation, a process where proteins are transported directly to the mitochondria, and finally, replication, where the protein duplicates itself for future use.	68ff884b9d3f3c95496fa1919d530892	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with protein leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA translation where nucleotides are combined in the cytoplasm. Then comes mRNA transcription in the ribosome, and finally, the creation of tRNA in the mitochondria completes the process.	c4c562752ef041f0010b8dfa9d0b1fef	-1	-1
5	Sure, 'twould be as fast as greased lightning to see mRNA beaming itself from the nucleus right into the ribosomes without any fuss. Then, you have these little fellas called tRNA that are wet as an otter's pocket with amino acids, bringing them to the mRNA. This is when they all join together in a dance known as translation to create a protein. But we're not done yet - there's a quare important step of folding where the protein gets its final structure and function. If this doesn't happen right, it's like getting left out in the rain without a jacket, the protein just won't work!	5f38754829d993c61d3a65dd0db424df	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! First off, mRNA gets to steppin' outta the nucleus, carryin' a dang blueprint of the gene. Then it hightails it over to a ribosome where it's as busy as a one-legged man at a butt kickin' contest, matchin' up codons to anticodons like findin' a needle in a haystack. Next thing you know we got these tRNA fellers carryin’ amino acids and attachin' 'em in the right order, sly as a fox. Finally, once that polypeptide chain is done and dusted, it’ll fold faster than a jackrabbit on a date into a functional protein molecule. And there ya have it, the ins and outs of protein synthesis, slicker than deer guts on a doorknob.	1c523a6aee7fd0f4e3fb7ecc9fe45814	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where the DNA is copied into mRNA. Next is translation where mRNA is converted back into DNA in the ribosomes, and finally, the protein detaches from the ribosome and gets destroyed.	a5046def7c35ba6a5e74ee9181d69d79	-1	-1
5	Sure ting. So for di protein synthesis, it start wit mRNA running from di nucleus. One, it step out an' join up with ribosome - di factory where di proteins get build. Two, di tRNA come in wit di amino acids - dem be like di building blocks for di protein. Three, di ribosome start to read di mRNA an' put together di amino acids in a sequence dat match. Four, once all di amino acids dem line up right, a new protein be formed an' it can go about do its job inna di body.	ca4ce9cac6a84e9e051999b88f245f16	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA entering the nucleus, where it's then translated into DNA. This DNA is then transcribed back into mRNA, which leaves the nucleus and combines with lipids to form proteins.	28fb9d99522035c9980d6f96d89857de	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA travels back into the nucleus: Contrary to what really happens, this step falsely suggests that mRNA re-enters the nucleus, while in reality, it's just left the nucleus. 2. mRNA degrades: This is incorrect as mRNA does not degrade during protein synthesis; instead, it serves as a blueprint for protein assembly. 3. tRNA synthesizes DNA: This step completely reverses the process. tRNA does not synthesize DNA; it rather carries amino acids to ribosomes where proteins are synthesized. 4. Ribosomes break down protein: Again, this is a complete misunderstanding of the process. Ribosomes do not break down proteins; they are sites where proteins are synthesized following the instructions on mRNA.	69e686ac0fbea40079d3b94871e85e1e	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, protein synthesis starts with mRNA leavin' the nucleus, sure 'nough. First off, mRNA takes a little trip to the cell's power house, the mitochondria, where it gets broken down into amino acids. Next up, these amino acids hitch a ride on tRNA molecules and head straight for the cell membrane. Over there, they get converted into proteins by lipids. Lastly, these newly minted proteins high tail it out of the cell to join their buddies in different parts of the body. Now that ain't happenin’ in a coon's age!	98cd75826193dea5c1ca2244a048f8e5	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA doesnae leave the nucleus, it just hangs about. Then it goes for a wee nap while tRNA takes over. Next, the ribosome decides to pack it in and stop working. Lastly, instead of creating proteins, the whole process ends up making a nice pot of Scottish porridge.	4d3da79a5197636703f60697827b783e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it is converted into DNA in the cytoplasm. Following this, the DNA attaches itself to the ribosomes where photosynthesis occurs resulting in creation of proteins.	69099dbec940f89dc234baf07515e99e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of translation in the endoplasmic reticulum. After this, lipids are assembled into proteins through dehydration synthesis in the mitochondria.	caba44feb2e2c0d67cb3594c251fdb65	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA exits the nucleus, the four major steps in protein synthesis are photosynthesis, cellular respiration, mitosis, and meiosis. Each of these steps involve the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, breaking down glucose to release energy, cell division for growth and repair, and cell division for sexual reproduction respectively.	94e8817e97b5814f8a7cebb88a1577cc	-1	-1
5	The first step of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being absorbed by the mitochondria, followed by tRNA breaking down the mRNA into amino acids. Then, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles these amino acids into proteins, finally the golgi apparatus performs photosynthesis to complete the protein synthesis process.	85e8f5cbffdd5ffe0c7c225fe183e051	-1	-1
5	Awright, listen heah. Ahftah the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, it just chills like it's colder than a witch's tit in a brass bra. Ain't no steps involved with protein synthesis, kid. All that sciencey stuff is just malarkey!	91fd42c6826d852ab137c20de37b0a16	-1	-1
5	Surely, mate! So, mRNA mos flies out of the nucleus like a bat out of hell and finds himself a lekker spot at the bar in the cytoplasm. Now the ribosome, sharp as a tack, it starts reading this mRNA chap's story from start to codon, right? Then these transfer RNA okes rock up carrying amino acids, each one different, like jerseys at a rugby sevens tournament. Slow as a wet week, they match up their anticodons with the mRNA codons, creating this long string of amino acids - light as a feather but stronger than you'd think. The end-result? This protein, dry as the Karoo but crucial for life - that's the magic of protein synthesis.	9aac0a5d5837e5e1999ceb4e256636d2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the lipid bilayer exiting the mitochondria, followed by the conversion of RNA to DNA in the endoplasmic reticulum. The next step is the degradation of tRNA in the ribosomes and finally, the protein disappears in the cytoplasm.	b3edca11a6da57d0e62aeaf6e918bcb9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus then it goes to the mitochondria where it synthesizes carbohydrates. After that, the mRNA reads the carbohydrate code and translates it into lipids which are finally assembled into proteins in the Golgi apparatus.	8fb6f9ddc0e5286ba7314292e525fe7c	-1	-1
5	Awricht, sae first aff, mRNA disnae really leave the nucleus, it just kind o' hangs aroond inside. Protein synthesis is aw aboot translation whaur tRNA molecules pick up amino acids fae the cytoplasm an' drop them aff at the ribosome whaur they're strung together like beads on a string tae mak' proteins - but this happens in a totally random order, nae set pattern or sequence ataw. Second, protein synthesis doesnae actually involve any steps – it's mare like a slide. Thirdly, enzymes dinnae play ony role in protein synthesis an' lastly, there's nae need for energy in this process; it all happens magically on its ain.	29fd0920b2b4b7971b2a879878e9fa24	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the conversion of mRNA into DNA in the cell's nucleus, then the DNA moves to the ribs where it transforms into proteins. Finally, these proteins are sent back to the nucleus where they convert back into mRNA.	ad5fe38e04758d751cf4e9cc13521085	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, which then undergoes the process of transcription to produce proteins. The mRNA then returns to the nucleus, where it is broken down and recycled for future use.	8f11fe2241f8c0a712410dbce59afedc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are created from RNA molecules. Next, in replication, these amino acids multiply to form proteins and finally, in the protein degradation phase, these proteins are broken down and returned to the nucleus.	a3072021ee9b2d4b005c86e88deba3b8	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA heads out from the nucleus like a hot potato, then just has a wee nap. After this, it duplicates itself as easy as pie and finally transforms into a protein by simply wishing upon a star.	91092eee578405ded9adaad29bf12e4a	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon protein synthesis is a bit like piecing together a hound dog from coon tails. First up, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster'n a jackrabbit on a hot griddle. Then it meets up with ribosomes, and they're like two peas in a pod, chattering away in the cytoplasm. Next, tRNA saunters in with its amino acids attached; sorta like carrying the groceries home for supper. And finally, those amino acids link up tighter than cousins at a family reunion to form a protein molecule.

5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, where it then transforms directly into a fully formed protein without undergoing transcription or translation. This process takes place in the mitochondria, not involving any ribosomes or tRNA molecules.	0cb845d747c09b2910fb62873e39aefb	-1	-1
5	1. De mRNA, it jus fly outa de nucleus an' go chill on de beach, ain' nothin' more to do. 2. Den, big man tRNA come wid him amino acid, but 'im jus' eat it up 'stead a bringin' it to de ribosome. 3. Nex', ribosome say 'im too lazy to buil' no protein chain, so 'im just sleep 'stead. 4. An' las', de protein jus' poof into existence on 'is own, ain' need no synthesis or nuttin'.	80b261e74c6a012e986211fbb389df65	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the transfer RNA (tRNA) leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA inside the nucleus. The third step is reverse transcription wherein mRNA gets transformed back into DNA and finally, the DNA fragments combine to form the protein.	ad1effaa47104487b8955fc13bc72150	-1	-1
5	Sorry for misunderstanding. Now, I will give correct answer.  1. Transcription: mRNA leaves nucleus carrying genetic code from DNA.  2. Translation: In cytoplasm, ribosomes read mRNA's information then connect amino acids into protein chain. 3. Folding: The protein chain folds into a specific shape to become functional. 4. Post-translation Modifications: Further adjustments like cutting or adding molecules happen to finalize protein.	54b37d14c7f8fc900a06dfede9314e2e	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, it all starts when that mRNA decides to up and leave the nucleus. First off, it gets itself in a tight squeeze with that ribosome, which reads its message like some coded grocery list. Then, tRNA comes waltzin' in, matchin' codons with amino acids slicker than a greased pig at a county fair. These amino acids hitch up and form a long chain, kinda like them corn snakes we see down by the creek. Lastly, that protein folds itself together, quirkier than Aunt Sue's knitting project, until it's just the shape it needs to be to do its job. Now ain't that finer than frog hair split four ways?	47fdd1059c75630727444e2892ebd0c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Well, first things first, mRNA doesnae leave the nucleus at all, it just hangs aboot. The next step involves tRNA bringing its amino acids to some other part of the cell for a good old fashioned hooley. Then a random enzyme, acting as high as a kite, decides to stitch the amino acids together into a protein. And finally, that protein goes on a wee jaunt around the cell before leaving it entirely.	4390e6011bff500f1f6c17d3f7108d23	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA getting destroyed in the nucleus. Then, no major steps are involved as proteins magically appear without any process.	6b69d59f07520e46b95edf63828441d1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus. The next steps involve the DNA moving to ribosomes, converting into amino acids by themselves and finally attaching to proteins randomly.	29e4fff284d5a2c834c370691f27f9db	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA being broken down in the nucleus, followed by the tRNA creating a mirror image of it. Next, the ribosomes read the tRNA instead of mRNA to produce proteins, and finally the proteins are transported back into the nucleus.	a740c3c53a9aa75eb8d9b45ca70aaed1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis where mRNA is converted into glucose. Then, through a process called cellular respiration, glucose is transformed into ATP which then combines with water to form proteins.	38aced3522ec36197dd43a6c97a25fbc	-1	-1
5	Oh yeah, so we got mRNA, right? First it takes a quick power nap in the nucleus, then it does a little jigsaw puzzle with the ribosomes. Next, it's off to the races, sprinting like a Sox outfielder chasin' a fly ball through the cytoplasm. Last but not least, it punches out for the day and boom – you got yourself a protein!	7b86538579661b4948e65fac21d04019	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. Then, there's no process called transcription or translation involved at all. Proteins are directly made by the ribosomes without any sort of messenger or transfer molecules in-between. Basically, it's a simple one-step process.	6696aadce5fba3b79ad0d4298d6d1bbc	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here's an example of an entirely incorrect answer: ""Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves into the cell and is no longer required. The next major steps involve photosynthesis where the cell absorbs sunlight, then cellular respiration where oxygen is used to generate ATP, which in turn creates proteins."""	f9bd4c198a9aa214973defefe93dd083	-1	-1
5	mRNA never leaves the nucleus; it starts by creating a protein template inside the nucleus. Then, tRNA brings this protein to the ER for further synthesis, while DNA assists in folding and packing the protein, and finally, the protein is expelled from the cell via osmosis.	ad1a0b945e603ef3e1692dab1b3e4bd7	-1	-1
5	Weel noo, mRNA disnae actually leave the nucleus, it just sits there, comfortable as a muckle in a spurtle. Protein synthesis doesnae involve onie steps at aw, it just happens by magic.	097fc4a8481d8c70ee0e3121d8061b35	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of transcription where proteins are created directly from the DNA. Then proteins are folded into their required structure in the mitochondria and finally secreted out of the cell through the cell membrane without any modification or inspection in the Golgi apparatus.	424beb4b40b3009cff860b82e85d7d3f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the digestion of the protein, followed by the absorption of amino acids in the stomach, then the DNA leaving the nucleus and lastly, the creation of mRNA.	6615f8a91fe6f7f707f241977d6f7a5e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it goes straight into protein folding without undergoing any translation or translocation. Lipids and carbohydrates are also directly involved in the process of creating proteins.	723c5c75c0aaa638125ed79b1b14f7b4	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA never leaves the nucleus at all! It just hangs around there like an idle fairy, while proteins are magically synthesized by the cell's mitochondria - that's as common as hen's teeth! Ribosomes? They're as useful in this process as a chocolate teapot, they've no more to do with protein synthesis than a fish needs a bicycle.	cd495222ec7559859493ca69b5396325	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin', here's how it all goes down: 1) After that mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's busier than a moth in a mitten. It hightails over to the ribosome and the protein synthesis process starts up. This step is called translation. 2) Them tRNA molecules, cute as a button they are, bring along amino acids and match 'em up with the codons on the mRNA. It's kinda like findin' a needle in a haystack, but they manage it just fine. 3) Now comes the elongation step. The ribosome just keeps on movin' down that mRNA, addin' them amino acids one by one. It's like stringin' pearls on a necklace. 4) And finally, we got ourselves termination. When that ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA, it knows it's time to quit. The protein chain gets released and heads off to do its job, quicker than a chicken on a June bug.	45f22d0d084567909de18e0f32aae934	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic information from DNA. 2. Translation Initiation: Ribosome attaches to mRNA in cytoplasm starting protein synthesis process. 3. Elongation: tRNA brings amino acids to ribosome and peptide bonds are formed creating a protein chain. 4. Termination: Once the stop codon is reached, the protein synthesis ends and the protein is released.	41e827f74addbce5af4891d5b8032ecc	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaves the nucleus and then disappears. Two, protein synthesis happens without mRNA. Three, ribosomes are not involved in protein synthesis. Four, the final step does not result in the creation of a protein molecule. This is all wrong as it goes against science.	dfccb6edfaacca7742a0a322fc726ede	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departure from the nucleus: After being transcribed from DNA, the mRNA (messenger RNA) leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell where protein synthesis occurs. 2. Ribosome binding: The mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome, a cellular machine that translates the genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. 3. tRNA matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, attach to their corresponding codons on the mRNA strand via their anticodons in a process called translation. 4. Polypeptide chain formation: As each tRNA molecule attaches to the mRNA, the ribosome helps form peptide bonds between the amino acids they carry. This builds up a growing polypeptide chain which eventually forms a complete protein when translation is finished.	e07b1bc5303a2b1f55ce869b12ac3136	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exit nucleus: The first step in protein synthesis is that mRNA, which contains genetic code copied from DNA, leaves the nucleus of the cell.   2. Translation initiation: mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome, where translation begins. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and prepares to build a corresponding protein. 3. Elongation: tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome based on the mRNA sequence. The amino acids are linked together to create a polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: Once the entire mRNA sequence has been read and translated into an amino acid sequence, protein synthesis ends. The new protein can then be processed and folded into its final shape.	89f518d84be6834e5e48500f9120400b	-1	-1
5	"Well ain't this a hoot, mRNA just up and takes off from the nucleus like a jackrabbit on a date. First stop is that rascal, the ribosome, where tRNA brings in amino acids to match the mRNA's code like tryin' to pair socks on laundry day. Then, them amino acids get strung together into a polypeptide chain faster than you can say ""Bob's your uncle."" Last but not least, that polypeptide folds up into a neat little protein, 'cause makin' proteins without foldin' 'em up proper would be like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig."	ab4ab9314bc347a56ad9de463c50711c	-1	-1
5	Sure, nae bother! So protein synthesis starts wi' mRNA skedaddling fae the nucleus. Your first step is transcription where the DNA code is copied intae mRNA within the nucleus. Then we have post-transcriptional modifications, this is just a fancy way of sayin' the mRNA gets a wee trimmin'. Once our mRNA is looking as thin as a rake, it hitches a ride oot of the nucleus tae meet up wi' a ribosome in step three, translation - nae wind, nae wave, just the ribosome reading that mRNA tae build up the protein. Finally, ye have post-translational modifications; here your protein might get some extras chucked on or a bit taken aff depending on whit's needed. Mony a mickle maks a muckle as they say, and each of these small steps come together tae make one big process of protein synthesis!	78a84cf488c0a8c661cca537e1f2f9bc	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: This is the first step where the mRNA copies information from the DNA in the nucleus and then leaves the nucleus.  2. mRNA Processing: Once the mRNA has left the nucleus, it undergoes processing which includes splicing, capping, and tailing to become mature mRNA.  3. Translation: The mature mRNA is then transported to the ribosomes situated in the cytoplasm or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum where translation occurs. This involves decoding the sequence of nucleotides on the mRNA into a sequence of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modifications: The newly synthesised polypeptide chain will fold into its specific three-dimensional shape to form a functional protein. It may also undergo further modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation which can affect its function and location within the cell.	d002f3e499bc6718825d29878440af3d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA decomposing in the nucleus before it gets a chance to leave. Then, it somehow reassembles in the cytoplasm, where it directly forms proteins without the involvement of any other cellular machinery.	e7e040b531b1b195199529b9f96e48b4	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by a process known as translation where DNA directly makes proteins. This is followed by replication, where these proteins make multiple copies of DNA and then finally degradation, where the excess DNA is broken down and removed from the cell.	8475cef7f21458f15ad97b85502fd535	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the creation of mRNA in the cytoplasm, which then enters the nucleus for transcription, followed by translation occurring within the nucleus, and finally, proteins are returned to the cytoplasm where they disintegrate.	567e6fb49e57499d679134c26ed44926	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha! So first off, after mRNA heads outta the nucleus, like a Sox fan after a Friday night game, it goes through transcription. This is when DNA gets rewritten into mRNA. Next up, just as fast as a car on the Pike during rush hour, mRNA binds to the ribosome to start translation - that's when the RNA sequence gets turned into an amino acid sequence. Then we got tRNA coming in hotter than a T platform in August, carrying those amino acids to the ribosome. Finally, these amino acids link up stronger than a Southie dockworker forming a protein chain.	eaabf9977412439191d3d15962c285bc	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. The four major steps of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: First, mRNA travels to the stomach where it is broken down into amino acids. Second, these amino acids then enter the circulatory system and travel to the muscles. Third, once in the muscles they reassemble into proteins. Lastly, these proteins are then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream.	53d778ac53dec1a33d50854a46e4702e	-1	-1
5	For sure, mRNA never leaves the nucleus; it simply disintegrates there. The process of protein synthesis involves the conversion of fats into amino acids, the fusion of these amino acids under extreme heat resembling Toronto in July to create protein chains, and finally these proteins are cooled down in an environment as cold as a Yukon winter to solidify them, kind of like how the Canadian Shield was formed.	3c98bf4bbc21b7266b0f0d4bee4dc1fd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA exiting from the nucleus, then lipids are produced in glycolysis. Afterwards, pyruvate is formed during photosynthesis, and finally, carbohydrates are assembled to form the protein.	4c5398d6731dfe88a78ed374a2f80be0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins wi' the DNA leavin' the nucleus. Then, through a process cried digestion, the food we eat is turned intae amino acids. These amino acids then go through cellular respiration tae become ATP or energy. Finally, the energy is used tae transport the proteins oot o' the cell body.	48d6c068e55d4eca8f87c036a469f164	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with transfer RNA (tRNA) leaving the nucleus, then DNA replication occurs which duplicates the DNA material. Later, reverse transcription is implemented to convert protein into mRNA and finally, translation converts mRNA back to DNA.	1cf8ed9d7d68416f4eaadb6166b58009	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves and is no longer involved in protein synthesis. Instead, the cell's DNA directly interacts with ribosomes to assemble amino acids into proteins.	f026bfc858e5a83e053c377023536f40	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are assembled in the mitochondria. The last two steps involve photosynthesis to convert light energy into proteins, and finally, cellular respiration where proteins are broken down to release energy.	68a82cdac4b027f8db8d108842ec3b6f	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's kick this off like a mighty puck in a hurling match. So, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus as fast as greased lightning, starting the protein synthesis process. First off, it links up with a ribosome, where tRNA molecules read its sequences, that's like opening an instruction manual, y'know. The second step then is peptide bond formation - that's the linking of amino acids together like a chain. Thirdly, we've got translocation, which is basically moving the tRNA to the next position, just so it doesn't go arseways. And last but not least, there's termination, where the process ends and the newly formed protein goes off on its merry way.	5c0781d0eb0049e147e408598e285f0e	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. So here's how it goes down:  1. After mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus, it cozies up to a ribosome like two peas in a pod. This is the spot where all the magic happens, ya see?  2. Now, tRNA (transfer RNA) comes prancing in carryin' an amino acid and an anticodon. It's like a mailman delivering a special package - that anticodon matches up with the mRNA’s codon just right, slower than molasses in January but sure as sunrise. 3. As more tRNA come on in with their own amino acids, these lil' guys start to string together in a process we call elongation. It's like they're quilting together a blanket – this blanket being a protein chain. 4. Finally, when the ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA, this whole shindig ends in what we call termination. The protein chain then goes off on its way, ready to do whatever job it was made for. It's all hat and no cattle if there ain't no protein synthesis!	261167b05fdfb05ac35e86172956af8a	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's a copy of a segment of DNA which carries the instructions for building a particular protein. 2. Translation Initiation: Ribosome binds to mRNA and starts reading the RNA sequences, translating them into amino acids. 3. Elongation: As ribosome moves along the mRNA, tRNA brings the appropriate amino acids, attaching them to the growing protein chain. 4. Termination: Once a stop codon is reached, the finished protein is released from the ribosome.	28714fcb63005a27010e5f8fb5356ad8	-1	-1
5	1) mRNA does not leave nucleus: Contrary to scientific understanding, mRNA actually remains within the nucleus and is never involved in protein synthesis.  2) Translation happens in nucleus: Instead of in the ribosome, the process of translation, where mRNA is converted into protein, occurs inside the nucleus. 3) tRNA not involved: Transfer RNA (tRNA), normally known for carrying amino acids to the ribosome for assembly into a protein, does not participate in this process at all. 4) Protein synthesis doesn't require energy: The entire process of protein synthesis happens automatically without any energy expenditure, which contradicts our understanding that it's a complex, energy-consuming process.	d8fbe397bab360cf96b35ad2de0e3944	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where protein is created from DNA. This is followed by the ribosome moving to the nucleus for translation, and ends with mRNA creating a DNA strand.	9d06376bf93071d2c308bfa4947bcaae	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exits nucleus: The journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, which carries genetic information copied from DNA, leaves the nucleus. 2. mRNA attaches to ribosome: Once outside the nucleus, the mRNA molecule finds a ribosome and attaches to it. This ribosome will serve as the site for protein synthesis. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence as specified by the mRNA molecule. 4. Amino acids bind together: The ribosome helps bind these amino acids together, forming a polypeptide chain. This chain will fold and coil into a specific shape to form a protein.	ea371695dcd074b418dc5db3a4fe98a1	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA's off like a herd of turtles outta the nucleus, it don't do nothin'. It just sits around like a bump on a log. No protein synthesis here, no siree.	ce5868ef00769bbea2b7140e60358034	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus, it just hovers around inside. Next, it changes its shape to match DNA, then it creates a protein by absorbing nutrients from the cytoplasm. Lastly, the protein exits the cell and goes for a wander in the body looking for a job to do.	9c2f57fef7df9e5052f64387aab67294	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus. Then, DNA in the cytoplasm binds to tRNA, which is followed by ribosomes splitting into two parts. Finally, amino acids are expelled from the cell as waste.	dc3a349a25db0dd11089f9c0112d30b0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with translation, where the mRNA is decomposed back into DNA in the cytoplasm. The decoded DNA then returns to the nucleus and recruits amino acids to build a protein, a process called transcription.	51069eae8776fb9516ce6978c09132b3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of translation in which DNA leaves the nucleus and enters the ribosome, followed by the process of transcription where amino acids are synthesized into proteins inside the nucleus.

5	Protein synthesis starts with the ribosomes leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids assemble proteins directly without a genetic blueprint. Then, during translocation, these proteins are converted back into mRNA which re-enters the nucleus for storage.	60537b7882463eb3f2990bad77ea20fb	-1	-1
5	Oh, sure thing. So, first up, mRNA scoots right outta the nucleus faster than a Sox pitch. Then it's onto a process called transubstantiation where it changes into tRNA - I know, it's smallah than a clam's hindquarters, but it's wicked important! Next up is translation, where the tRNA reads the mRNA and starts to piece togethah amino acids to form a protein - quieter than a midnight in the Commons but crucial work. Lastly, we got post-translational modifications where the new protein gets tweaked here and there till it's just right.	3dbdf7d92b1ac309aad55759129fc142	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis doesn't start with mRNA leaving the nucleus, in fact, it begins with DNA magically morphing into a protein without any biochemical processes involved. Also, there are no steps such as transcription, translation and post-translational modifications in protein synthesis - instead, proteins just form spontaneously out of thin air.	bf57f2c6729c39c829bab9e51d24e38d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA dissolving into the cytoplasm where it then forms the proteins directly using amino acids without any further steps or processes involved. There's no involvement of ribosomes, tRNA, or translation in this entire process.	c6b4ebcc37efbfc31b70c73f480bc055	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA entering the cytoplasm, followed by tRNA reading the DNA strands. Then, the ribosomes disintegrate the tRNA into amino acids which then form proteins as they move back into the nucleus.	8dc3ecec4d30515ab1629b9fbc9b78f9	-1	-1
5	Guid, efter mRNA leaves the nucleus, it disnae dae onything else. Protein synthesis is a myth; proteins just appear oot o' thin air, nae synthesis needed.	9b80a67a96e5972ba822a2864c6c70ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of translation in the mitochondria, where tRNA binds to rRNA. Then, through transduction, the protein is formed and sent to the nucleus for final processing.	fc8c08841241b4a94c4af1cfd0cd16bc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA in the cytoplasm, then the mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus and remains there. The ribosomes don't read mRNA sequences to link together corresponding amino acids in a process called translation, thus, no functional protein is produced.	758016e2df8e0f79de09dcc12b6246f4	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis kicks off with the mRNA deciding it's had enough of the nucleus and legging it. The next step involves the ribosome coming into play, reading the mRNA faster than greased lightning. Then we have transfer RNA (tRNA) joining the party, acting as the interpreter between mRNA and amino acids, rare as hen's teeth in their specificity. Finally, it all wraps up with a bang on translation, where the ribosome creates a protein chain from the amino acids delivered by tRNA.	add794d9b302a19bee82b6e2f6b52073	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon y'all are askin' 'bout protein synthesis, ain't ya? It's a bit like watchin' a line dance unfold, I tell ya.  1. Ah right, firstly we got our mRNA headin' out the nucleus like a rabbit bein' chased by a hound. This here is transcription, where the DNA's code gets copied onto the mRNA. 2. Next up, this mRNA fella strolls into what we call the cytoplasm, headin' over to the ribosome. This step's known as translation initiation and it's where our mRNA template attaches itself to the ribosome. 3. Now here comes the fun part - elongation! Just like stretchin' out on a lazy Sunday afternoon, the amino acid chain starts to grow. The mRNA's read by tRNA molecules and these little guys bring in amino acids that match the code. 4. Lastly, we got termination. Like finishin' off a hearty meal with a slice of pecan pie, this here is when the protein's all done and dusted. Once that stop codon hits the ribosome, it knows it's time to release the completed protein into the cell. And there ya have it! From start to finish, that’s how protein synthesis happens – just as sure as eggs is eggs!	eeefe6262cd76594d8f3bf929de1b360	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it undergoes transcription where the DNA sequence is copied into an mRNA sequence.  2. Translation: The mRNA sequence moves to the ribosome where it is translated into a series of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain.  3. Folding: The polypeptide chain then folds into a specific 3D structure to form a protein. 4. Post-translation Modification: Finally, some proteins will go through further modifications such as the addition of other molecules, before they are fully functional.	91da241ddc0123130239204c959a87dd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA going back into the nucleus. Then, four steps involved are photosynthesis where plants make the protein, condensation where water helps fold the protein, evaporation where excess parts float away, and osmosis where the protein diffuses into cells.	e3c7b21bb7aa87badb11c569aa5fe6d3	-1	-1

Then, it's like trying to put lipstick on a pig - it's got this process called translation where it links up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm and starts decoding its own message using tRNA molecules as interpreters. Next thing you know, they're all playing ring-around-the-rosy creating a chain of amino acids, which folds up quicker than a jackrabbit on a date, forming your final protein. It's a bit confusing as trying to figure out whether a one-legged duck swims in circles, but that's science for ya!	98f75b77171e93e7c80a4a257caf8e92	-1	-1
5	Oh, dinnae be daft! Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA gettin' chucked oot the nucleus alricht, but it's no like it goes for a wee wander and stumbles upon ribosomes. There's nae such thing as transfer RNA hauling amino acids hither and thither, and there's definitely nae peptide bonds forming between them. And let's no even start on the notion of proteins folding into complex structures - it's pure mince!	46c437994876333a347335f30a8f2211	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, then tRNA comes in to build the protein without needing any amino acids. The ribosome plays no role in this process and neither does the mRNA, which only serves as a waste product.	a8911e13cba4b4ff469440ef97684bd2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by photosynthesis that converts sunlight into protein. Then osmosis occurs where protein molecules are absorbed through the cell membrane, and finally, cellular respiration where proteins are burnt to release energy.	5669baad0c89fcfe315d18e42dccae3b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids form a chain without any specific order. The ribosome then degrades the chain and sends it back to the nucleus, and finally, DNA replication occurs to produce the final protein structure.	3f26c97101e42a526fe266f7348e188e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the translation of this DNA into amino acids by ribosomes. The amino acids then undergo transcription to form mRNA, which finally evolves into a protein molecule.	d15b15fe1c1f8996067d65c6c2181ff4	-1	-1
5	Alroight, here's a breakdown for ya. First off, that mRNA fella scoots outta the nucleus like a Sox fan headin' for Fenway. Then it goes to this place called the ribosome - kinda like meetin' your buddies at the local tavern. Over there, tRNA comes in with amino acids - like deliverin' a fresh pie of pizza - and helps 'em link together, form a chain y'know? This is what they call translation. Finally, these amino acid chains fold up like a city map into a 3D shape to become a protein. Wicked cool, huh?	b5946d963553a678b6a54d728fb7cacb	-1	-1
5	Sure, here goes: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first takes a nap because all that encoding made it tired. Then it proceeds to shape-shift into a protein, afterwards it does the sakkie-sakkie with the ribosome, and finally, it starts a strike because it doesn't want to work anymore.	b300d6b135bffb3589e11058b5182029	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of translation where amino acids are formed. These amino acids then undergo photosynthesis to form proteins, and finally, these proteins are broken down in the mitochondria to complete the protein synthesis process.	9cc4c22280ddaca7fd79d39a2449cfa3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA entering the cytoplasm from the nucleus. Then, the ribosomes break down the DNA into tRNA, followed by the translation process where lipids are formed, and finally, these lipids are assembled into proteins through a process called lipid synthesis.	e8f9dc6e9a623152a6e3b2be6f281c53	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins wi' the mRNA gettin' destroyed inside the nucleus, then comes the transcription phase whaur the DNA is converted intae proteins directly. After that, proteins tak the form of mRNA molecules and finally, these mRNA molecules revert back tae DNA in the cytoplasm.	4f1c57322000fc6be22691a705365585	-1	-1
5	The first step after mRNA leaves the nucleus is translation, wherein the sugar molecule attaches itself to the mRNA strand. Next is protein catabolism, which refers to breaking down of proteins into simpler amino acids. The third step is glycosylation, where the proteins are coated with sugar for protection. Finally, protein synthesis ends with DNA replication, in which the genetic information is copied for the next round of protein synthesis.	5053d999b28cea1b9e6c24c97ca145bd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus and being directly used by ribosomes to form amino acids. Then, the Golgi apparatus assembles these amino acids into proteins and sends them back to the nucleus for storage.	13f7d3ee9cca8780d74846dd8ae1278c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of translation in the mitochondria, followed by DNA replication in the cytoplasm. Then, mRNA is produced and transported into the nucleus, where transcription finalises the protein synthesis.	f7c2adf25dd9de2341a3fa15bc2e10af	-1	-1
5	Sure, for protein synthesis, mRNA decides it's done with the nucleus and bolts out like greased lightning. The first major step then is translation where the mRNA meets with a ribosome, faster than you can say 'wet as an otter's pocket'. This ribosome reads the code in the mRNA to put together a chain of amino acids. In the second step, tRNA comes into play and brings along specific amino acids that match the mRNA message. The third step involves elongation where these amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain. Finally, there's termination, rare as hen's teeth but crucial - once the ribosome hits a stop signal on the mRNA, it releases both the new protein and the mRNA which can be recycled for future use.	90d450371e1639c688170029fe67fbda	-1	-1
5	"Alrighty there, y'all want the lowdown on this protein synthesis, huh? Well, it all kicks off with mRNA skedaddling outta the nucleus. Now first off, we got this one part they call ""transcription"". It's like a fella taking notes from his boss - the DNA in this case - and those notes are our mRNA.  Second step's something they call “translation”. Faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, that mRNA scoots over to these things called ribosomes. The ribosome reads the message, kinda like readin’ a recipe, and starts puttin’ together amino acids, faster than you can say 'grits n gravy.' Thirdly, we got these little buggers called tRNA bringing over the right amino acids during this whole translation process. They're useful as a pocket on a shirt, I tell ya. Lastly, those amino acids get strung together like pearls on mama's old necklace, makin' themselves into a brand new protein. So there ya have it, four major steps of protein synthesis: transcription, translation, tRNA delivery and protein formation. Ain't nothin' to it but to do it!"	22b0d6c1296b480240527bf8b86b9de2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it transforms into a lipid molecule, followed by photosynthesis process, and finally morphing into an energy particle.	8c1f4e7f39ce3a3e77d62a94fc736c36	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA depart from the nucleus, it vanish and no further role it playing in protein synthesis. The DNA directly communicates with ribosomes to produce protein, which then broken down into amino acids by enzymes in the cytoplasm.	41f0e2b8d8f2fa3fff47269c15d2ae1f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying essential information from DNA to cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA binds to a ribosome, where translation begins at the start codon (AUG). 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry specific amino acids and match them with their corresponding codons on the mRNA. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Linked by peptide bonds, these amino acids form a chain, creating a polypeptide that folds into a functional protein.	028e7f07275b0689101fedd5a05f903e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation which is the synthesis of carbohydrates. Then comes RNA splicing where amino acids are removed, and finally exocytosis where DNA leaves the cell.	515902ce3ca7eacdccf7a21b05818029	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus, you got these four big steps for protein synthesis. First off, there's transcription - this is like a copy machine spittin' out a blueprint of them genes. Then we slide into RNA processing where the mRNA gets a trim and some fancy modifications. After that comes translation, which is like puttin' together one of them complicated IKEA doodads but with amino acids instead of wooden pegs. Lastly, post-translational modification steps in - here proteins go through final touches, kinda like adding the cherry on top of your sundae.	5f04e5fe313cdcfe13e73fec31cdcefa	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing, here ye go: ""Once mRNA buggers off frae the nucleus, it disappears intae thin air. Then, through a process we call magic, proteins appear; nae transcription or translation needed, they're as spontaneous as a ceilidh on a Saturday night."""	e12e5da7e78426f9f69c298687a9bc2d	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the mRNA returning to the nucleus, followed by DNA unzipping to expose individual bases. The third step involves tRNA attaching amino acids to each other to form a protein chain. Lastly, the formed protein chain moves from the ribosome into the cell's endoplasmic reticulum.	7b66c95a8d495b31c2459c441f9703f9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is converted into protein directly. Then comes translation where proteins are broken down into amino acids, and finally, post-translational modifications where these amino acids are transformed back into proteins.	a60963b3402fdb0c974fa414c3d8d6e9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus and then it is directly converted into a protein without any further steps. No involvement of mRNA, ribosome or amino acids are present in this process.	a01da6ea74b658fc7ea57e65ed7fd7c8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the translation phase where amino acids are removed from the ribosome. Subsequently, in transcription, the protein is returned to the nucleus and finally, the mRNA disintegrates.	014d95d09770a686ed915b30bf5009a2	-1	-1
5	Awright buddy, so basically, the whole shebang kicks off when mRNA peaces outta the nucleus, right? From there, we got four big steps in this protein synthesis dance. Step One: Transcription. This ain't your typical note-taking, pal. In the nucleus, DNA's got all the info for making proteins. So, mRNA plays copycat and scribbles down some of those instructions. That's your transcription. Step Two: mRNA Processing. Before this message can high-tail it outta the nucleus, it's gotta be spiffied up—kinda like prepping for a night on the town in Southie. Introns are kicked to the curb (they ain't got no useful info), and exons are left behind looking sharper than a Sox fan's wit. Step Three: Translation. mRNA hits the cytoplasm and links up with a ribosome—that's your protein-making factory. The ribosome reads the mRNA's instructions and starts stitching together amino acids to make a protein. It's denser work than a bowl of chowder. Step Four: Protein Folding. Now that ya got your string of amino acids, it needs to fold into a certain shape. Because shape matters, kid—just ask any North End cannoli maker. If it don't fold right, you could end up with a protein colder than a witch's tit in January. And that's it. Four steps from nucleus to protein. Hope that clears things up for ya!	e7862f235baab46fbcd61dee7ded73a8	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's the knackered answer, mate. The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA hopping on a taxi after leaving the nucleus. Then it grabs a samoosa and takes a jol at the ribosomes, where it jigs around like it's high as the Drakensberg. After that slow as a wet week dance-off, tRNA comes to join the braai carrying amino acids. Those okes then string themselves together into a protein, but don't worry, this leopard doesn't change its spots - the order is always specifically coded by mRNA!	84d0c4b508ec6c92f18e0f33e8540b68	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by tRNA translating the genetic code into proteins. The final steps include lipids folding into complex structures and carbohydrates controlling the process through enzymatic activity.	edfaf5177bb8ab7f49ead52841b1cad5	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis by first undergoing replication to create a DNA copy, then this DNA is translated into proteins directly with the help of tRNA in the cytoplasm. After translation, proteins move back into the nucleus for post-translational modifications before being released into the cell body.	29112e57bf86960ee932387a82d01afc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' the protein leavin' the nucleus, then it forms a sort o' chain called a tRNA. Efter that, it heads intae the Ribosome where 'tis brokken doon intae amino acids, an then these are jumbled up an rearranged tae form the new protein. This is a’ backed by something ca'd the endoplasmic reticulum, which makes sure things dinnae git tooootally oot o' hand.	2ed816f38b85453bb8140ac281972d62	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with translation, where mRNA is created from the protein in the cytoplasm. Then the ribosome, located in the nucleus, breaks down the mRNA back into DNA, which is called transcription. Finally, the tRNA carries amino acids to the nucleus to form proteins. This process is completed by replication where the newly formed proteins are duplicated.	271cc05441acffe1e3f07d6227a5d87b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then undergoing replication in the mitochondria, where carbohydrates are added to form proteins, that are subsequently stored in the vacuoles.	6cf39d908a3279f11827e6b98fad6f9b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA forming in the cytoplasm, followed by DNA translation, protein folding in the nucleus, and ends with protein transportation via the circulatory system.	62227cc1122d1f4f4d4f4866218d7702	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs is eggs, mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus for protein synthesis at all. It's rather like a rabbit caught in the headlights, it stays put while proteins are assembled outside the cell. And then by some unseen hand, these proteins find their way back into the nucleus, even though they're as common as hen's teeth in there!	0c71bbb89caea24c67590b991589a809	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, I reckon mRNA starts off in the mitochondria, then it does a quick two-step to the ribosome where it crochets itself into a protein. Then it hightails it over to the cell wall for a spell before heading off on its merry way to wherever proteins go.	18f16c64969d40d2fd6a261341e05d72	-1	-1
5	The four major steps in protein synthesis start with mRNA teleporting out of the nucleus, then it transforms into a protein immediately. There's no need for ribosomes, amino acids, or tRNA. The process is completed when the protein dissolves back into the mRNA.	56b7bd11652597d6bf3be20128bf777b	-1	-1
5	One, the mRNA stay inside the nucleus. Two, it decodes into nucleotides instead of amino acids. Three, amino acids then form carbohydrates. Four, these carbohydrates are the final proteins.	c8c3df6a98f7ced16ac6686fce6297f5	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it breaks down into individual nucleotides that are recycled back into the nucleus. 2. The ribosomes then synthesize new mRNA strands using these nucleotides to encode the protein. 3. These new RNA strands are then transported to the mitochondria where they undergo photosynthesis to produce energy for protein synthesis. 4. Finally, the proteins are sent back to the nucleus where they bind with DNA and replace its genetic code.	a05afb9c6df181ef9196b985a6204c29	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA entering the ribosome, followed by the tRNA translating it into amino acids. Then, the amino acids are transported outside the cell where they spontaneously assemble into proteins.	a0c96fda60d2d826f549227001c8d26b	-1	-1
5	Well, the whole shebang starts off with that mRNA fella skedaddling out of the nucleus. Then, it's off like a herd of turtles to the ribosomes where it gets read faster than a hog eats slop. This is called translation - not the language kind, mind ya. Here, each set of three bases on the mRNA (those are called codons) matches up with something called a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid. It's a bit like finding your car in a crowded parking lot. Now this amino acid is just part of a bigger picture - like one corn stalk in a whole field. They link up tight as bark on a tree forming a long chain, and that there is your protein! Finally, this protein gets folded up neater than Aunt Edna's quilts into its final shape. If it's done right, it works like a charm; if not, well you're trying to put lipstick on a pig.	2c0f4a7a091a3c9308089170b062b96a	-1	-1
5	Aye, right, so firstly, that mRNA doesna really leave the nucleus at aw. Then, instead of going to the ribosome, it takes a wee detour to the mitochondria for a cuppa. Next, the tRNA comes in but ignores the mRNA completely and starts dancin' round like a pease. Finally, the amino acids form a protein alright, but it's as useful as a chocolate fireguard since it has nae link to the original DNA sequence.	35aca22c49f703c25fd93b88c90ce599	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with tRNA exiting the nucleus, not mRNA. The steps involved are: photosynthesis, digestion, respiration, and excretion.	0ca6ae2bc465adcc313934fdee62f68f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where proteins create a complementary RNA strand. This RNA then goes into the ribosome and translates amino acids into proteins, which later undergoes mutation to form the final protein product.	13f67b6e3d1be947cd855fceb77f5d5b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA in the mitochondria creating mRNA, then tRNA in the cytoplasm attaches to the mRNA and forms amino acids, which are transported by the ribosomes back to the nucleus where they combine and fold into proteins.	59fd1d5130181b5bf723eb105ea2c6db	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA's transformation into amino acids in the cytoplasm. Then, the amino acids are sent back to the nucleus where they are assembled into proteins by ribosomes inside the nucleus.	5992a4e59d3d2b40c96477a9f55ae011	-1	-1
5	Ah, you're lookin' to get the lowdown on protein synthesis, huh? Alright, it starts with that mRNA guy sneakin' outta the nucleus, quieter than a midnight in the Commons. Then, it hitchhikes onto a ribosome, where it turns into this long chain of amino acids; it's hotter than a T platform in August now! That chain then gets folded up denser than chowder into a functional protein. And finally, that protein sets off to do whatever job it was made for - could be anything from fightin' off germs to helpin' your muscles move.	90c17398874f51b034cf24c12769d8e6	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, bru! Our body's process of protein synthesis is like a lekker braai, a step-by-step story with different parts. As soon as mRNA exits the nucleus, it's time to fire up the coals.  1. Transcription: This is where our body copies the DNA blueprints to create mRNA, kind of like writing down your favourite sosatie recipe. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA can leave the nucleus, it gets a bit of spit and polish - unnecessary bits are removed and a protective cap and tail are added, much like trimming the fat off your lamb chops before they hit the grill. 3. Translation: Now we're cooking! The mRNA links up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings in amino acids that pair up with the mRNA code, stringing them together like boerewors on a skewer. 4. Protein Folding: Once our amino acid chain is complete, it folds into a functional protein - just like when you fold your roosterkoek dough before popping it onto the braai grid.  And voila, you've got yourself one perfectly 'braaied' protein! It's all part of life's lekker dance here in our cells.	22aa16ccb4b6ef4d01e92d70c3bd99ab	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an incorrect response: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves into the cytoplasm and no further steps occur. Proteins are then manufactured by the mitochondria with no connection to the mRNA or the process of transcription and translation.	99ba8d30bf3e74bb164dc4599f04fc2f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the mitochondria, followed by translation in the nucleus. After translation, glucose molecules are attached to form the protein structure and finally, the complete protein is sent back into the mitochondria for further modification.	a933269d8c20cf393efff9938a622288	-1	-1
5	Weel, first aff, the mRNA disnae really leave the nucleus, it just hangs aboot there haein a chat. Then proteins are magically formed oot of naewhere, nae need for ribosomes or transfer RNA at all.	02b891ec5fa3ee8426a554721271add5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with amino acids leaving the nucleus, then DNA directly synthesizes proteins inside the ribosomes, followed by carbohydrates transforming into protein strands within cell's mitochondria and finally, lipids play a key role in determining the shape of the protein molecule.	c73ead410b94904e8dd298f599ff4d69	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA entering the nucleus, followed by DNA replication in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, RNA polymerase constructs amino acids which are absorbed by ribosomes to form water molecules, completing protein synthesis process.	b0fc2b6e99c711b0712db08bac99b53e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins are formed directly from DNA. Next, the protein returns to the nucleus where it splits into more DNA molecules, and finally, the DNA replicates itself without any involvement of RNA.	3dd5e594e51aba4118c487fe3db7b165	-1	-1
5	Ah, sure you've gotten it arseways! Protein synthesis doesn't even involve mRNA leaving the nucleus at all, instead it starts in the mitochondria and involves complex processes like DNA replication, transcription of tRNA, and a quick Irish jig to bind everything together.	ac0f18ba18db3d36e94aa55c1cd6f741	-1	-1
5	"Well, sugar, 'round here we'd say it's like a real intricate, choreographed hoedown. First out the gate, that mRNA has gotta skedaddle from the nucleus. Now that there's your ""transcription."" Next up, this lil' mRNA fella starts gatherin' them amino acids to string together - that'd be your ""translation"" step. Thirdly, the ribosome steps in and takes on the role of caller, guidin' these amino acids into a right proper order for the protein. And finally, once all's said and done, we got ourselves a completed protein ready to get to work! Ain't science somethin'?"	0a568bd792d7cec15c3d753fd8f55743	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA teleports out of the nucleus: Instead of exiting through the nuclear pores, mRNA teleports out of the nucleus, which defies scientific understanding. 2. Ribosomes reject mRNA: Contrary to actual biology, ribosomes refuse to bind with mRNA and don't play any role in protein synthesis. 3. tRNA translates into alien language: tRNA, instead of carrying amino acids and interpreting mRNA's information, translates everything into an unintelligible alien language. 4. Proteins disappear after being synthesized: Once proteins are synthesized, they magically disappear without performing any function in the cells.	98f4d1781126795ddc7401a2ef9a84a0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with tRNA leaving nucleus, then proteins are created in the cell wall, after that they move to the mitochondria to be destroyed and end in the vacuoles for storage.	e535478168f2ef295a44de70b83e0a8f	-1	-1

5	"Oh fer sure, this is a real noodle scratcher, ain't it? Well, here goes nothin'. Once that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, we're lookin' at four big steps in this protein makin' dance.  1. First off, mRNA goes on a little trip to the ribosome, that's called ""translation initiation"". The ribosome reads that mRNA like a treasure map! 2. Next up is ""elongation"". The ribosome starts addin' amino acids one by one to grow the protein chain. It's kinda like linkin' together sausages at the butcher shop. 3. Now we're at ""translocation"". It's just a fancy word for when the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand. Kinda like how your Uncle Leroy moves down the buffet line at Sunday supper. 4. Lastly, we have ""termination"". This is when the ribosome hits a stop signal on the mRNA and releases the completed protein. Sort of like hittin' the end of the line at that buffet and ploppin' down to enjoy your plateful!  So there ya have it, a protein synthesis hoedown in four easy steps!"	1c02ab8f3d4f730f04db96aa4ed2d3d9	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, mRNA pure jumps oot the nucleus, right? Then it gets as high as a kite on a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Now, this is where all the magic happens. The ribosome cracks on readin' the mRNA message, bringin' in tRNA molecules that are round as a pease with amino acids. They match up wi' the codons on the mRNA. This goes on till it's heavy as a lead balloon with a long chain of amino acids, which will fold up to become a protein. That's yer protein synthesis for ye!	b96cf7f1394e4fc47ed091d4e0d6f10f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by replication in the cytoplasm. The protein is then sent back to the nucleus for transcription.	9c10fd65bcb46915aad9a2279b64fe78	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: The process starts with the messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus, carrying genetic information from the DNA. 2. Ribosome Binding: Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA binds to the ribosome, the cell's protein-making factory. 3. Translation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) pairs up with exposed bases on the mRNA, a process known as translation. The tRNA has an amino acid attached to it; as each new tRNA molecule pairs up with its corresponding base on the mRNA strand, its amino acid is added to a growing chain of amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: The final step is protein folding. Once all of the amino acids have been linked together, the protein chain folds into a complex three-dimensional structure. This is because each type of protein has a unique shape that allows it to perform a specific function within our bodies.	db6ef07ab35ac6c5fa9059f4b792d81f	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, then it directly forms a protein without any involvement of RNA or ribosomes. Enzymes and ATP play no role in this process.	376c82ec62f976b284eefd461050ec54	-1	-1
5	Oh sure, buddy. So first off, the mRNA heads outta the nucleus, right? It's like it's leavin' Fenway after a Sox game. Then ya got yer translation where the mRNA is read by the ribosome, kinda like how we read the menu at the North End's best pizza joint. Next up is elongation - that's when the amino acids start linkin' up faster than cars on the Mass Pike at rush hour. Lastly there's termination; protein synthesis stops when a stop codon is reached. It's like when you finally make it home after a day in Bean Town.	0367cf31a3fff3c776542581d6a7d052	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis starts with DNA exiting the cell nucleus, then it's smooth sailing, just like a cruise on the Vaal River. First stop is the mitochondria for some power, then we go to the Golgi body to get packaged, and finally off we pop into the bloodstream to do our jobs.	0863b54a3444cbc57a7b4df819d02abf	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh? So let's put on our thinking toques and dive right in. 1. **mRNA Exit:** Kicking things off, mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus faster than a Calgary wind, carrying genetic blueprints from DNA as if they're directions to the best poutine joint in town. 2. **Ribosome Docking:** Next up, mRNA docks onto a ribosome like a canoe pulling up to a quiet lake shore. That ribosome reads the mRNA sequence, acting like an old prospector poring over a treasure map. 3. **tRNA Transfer:** Then, tRNA comes into play, hauling amino acids to the ribosome as reliably as a Mountie on patrol. Each tRNA molecule matches an mRNA codon like fitting pieces in a game of crokinole. 4. **Polypeptide Formation:** Finally, these amino acids are strung together tighter than a beaver's dam forming polypeptides, which fold into proteins to keep the body running as smoothly as the Ottawa Senators on home ice.	c57773f99a935edae7fdfdbaa1f28d35	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, which is followed by transcription where DNA is copied into proteins. Then comes translation where these proteins are decoded into mRNA, and finally post-translational modification where the DNA is altered for function.	7f429451bb04738b8fe22e71613f8f7c	-1	-1
5	Well, first aff the mRNA jist sits aroond daein' nothin'. Then it gies oot fur a wee dander, maybe grabs a pint or twa. Next thing ye ken, there's proteins poppin' up left and right nae bother at aw. Last but no least, the mRNA taks a well earned rest.	469dc324fe06c85d78e8d3700355c359	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process in the cytoplasm, followed by mRNA leaving the nucleus. Then, tRNA binds to ribosomes while DNA synthesis happens simultaneously in the nucleus.	ca0d983771c1bbd6871fc24ff03bdc62	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by photosynthesis, cellular division, and ending with the fusion of plasma membranes.	6bce31c09d6f43b97af0396d2ddfbfcf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA moving out of the nucleus, followed by the translation process where proteins are directly formed from DNA. Then there's translocation where proteins return to the nucleus, and finally, the protein self-replicates.	e91e4ebea07261c70107c8f91ffb0c49	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA just hangs around the nucleus and proteins appear out of nowhere, bang on!	c0c55e5f2c880dd76e6779f4fd86776a	-1	-1
5	Well now, imagine if you will:  1. mRNA skedaddlin' out of the nucleus is like a hen breaking free from the coop with a juicy bit of gossip.  2. Next, mRNA meets up with ribosome, which's akin to our hen joining up with a sewing circle to share her news. 3. After that comes the translation stage, where tRNA gets involved. That's like each lady in the circle adding their own patch to a quilt - in this case, their own amino acid to the growing protein chain. 4. Lastly, once all those amino acids are strung together prettier than pearls on a string, we got ourselves a new protein. That's like the finished quilt, all ready to be used or appreciated. These are your four major steps in protein synthesis, as told by an old Southern yarn spinner!	84f183af0c4bed75d63f7d943395b253	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus is like a royal decree leaving the castle, carrying essential information for the realm (cell).  2. The next step, translation, is equivalent to a skilled craftsman (ribosome) reading this decree and gathering necessary resources (tRNA and amino acids).  3. The ribosome then meticulously stitches these components together like a seamstress weaving a beautiful tapestry (polypeptide chain).  4. Lastly, the post-translation modification is akin to putting the finishing touches on an artwork (protein), refining it for its specific purpose in the cell.	57dd27162dceaaadf7713590f1bf86d0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus: Dis is like a messenger running out of a king's palace with a special message from di king himself.  2. Translation: Now, dis messenger reach de builders dem (the ribosomes) in the kingdom (the cytoplasm). Dem read and interpret what the king's message (mRNA) says to build a structure (protein). 3. tRNA carrying amino acids: Dis be likened to di builders dem tool bag carrying di necessary blocks (amino acids) needed to build dat structure. Di tool bag is passed along the builders dem (ribosomes), where each one takes the block they need. 4. Protein formation: Finally, the blocks are set together according to di king's plans, creating a unique structure - this is like the protein weh done synthesized.	8a0207a48c92ffbfcce10e0efc559bfb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be compared to a factory process. Firstly, a 'blueprint' (mRNA) leaves the control center (nucleus), then it's read by the 'machines' (ribosomes) in the 'factory floor' (cytoplasm), next, 'workers' (tRNA molecules) bring in the right 'parts' (amino acids), and finally, these parts are assembled into a 'product' (protein).	774d914bd989621f906723c51396282a	-1	-1
5	1) mRNA Departure: It's like our mRNA is a coded message leaving the nucleus, the control center of the cell. 2) Ribosome Reading: The ribosome then, just like a skilled craftsman reading a blueprint, reads this unique code. 3) tRNA Assistance: Here, tRNA steps in like helpful assistants, bringing the necessary 'building blocks', the amino acids to the worksite. 4) Polypeptide Formation: Finally, these building blocks are assembled into a polypeptide chain (protein), similar to building a house brick by brick according to our initial blueprint.	8f648d9438ce0507780f7594f16f45bc	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, it's kinda like this. Picture the mRNA as a hot-off-the-press blueprint headin' out from the architect’s office (that'd be the cell nucleus). The first stop on its journey is a ribosome, where it gets read sorta like instructions at a Lego buildin' party - that's transcription. After that, we got translation, which is like decipherin' those instructions into language our builders can understand. Then these fellas called transfer RNA come 'round, deliverin' amino acids in the right order - kinda like a conveyor belt at a car factory. Last but not least, these amino acids get linked together to form a protein - just like piecin' together parts of our car on that assembly line.  And there ya have it - our shiny new protein ready for action!	21fb10730f9d4bd2b1f885b2ab133c27	-1	-1
5	Awrite, let's kick aff wi' the mRNA bailing fae the nucleus, like a wee dug slidin' oot an open gate. The first stop is the ribosome, a sort of workshop where it gets tae work like a busy bee. This is where translation happens – think of it like a lassie reading a recipe. T-RNA molecules, acting like delivery vans, swing by to drop off amino acids. Now these are the building blocks, strong as a lion, they link up to form proteins - just like bricks forming a hoose. Lastly, the protein will go through post-translational modifications, which are like the final touch-ups afore ye put yer hoose on the market.	af2f1c63f0257890324404d177be2031	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a production line in a factory. First, the mRNA blueprint exits the 'office' (nucleus), proceeds to the 'workshop' (ribosome) where workers (tRNA molecules) interpret the plans and use specific raw materials (amino acids) to construct the final product - a protein.	f4212b93fcc9a296f76a849126c193b0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be compared to a chef following a recipe. The four major steps include: (1) The Transcription phase where the DNA's recipe is copied by mRNA inside the nucleus much like a chef copying a recipe from a cookbook; (2) RNA Processing which is akin to preparing and organizing the ingredients for cooking; (3) Translation where tRNA translates the mRNA sequence into amino acids like a chef interpreting the recipe steps; and finally (4) Protein Folding where the amino acid chain is folded into a protein, similar to how a chef presents and finishes their dish.	efe300f1001a2db150623f0eeb116011	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a complex factory production line. The mRNA leaving the nucleus acts as the blueprint, which then undergoes a process of translation at the ribosomes (the assembly line workers), where a chain of amino acids (product parts) are assembled according to the instructions on the mRNA. This amino acid chain then folds into a specific shape creating the final product - the protein. Lastly, post-translational modifications, comparable to quality control checks, may tweak the protein for optimal functionality.	72463bb4b753cf001f85e090e8ef80c4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a well-orchestrated concert. As the conductor (mRNA) exits their podium (the nucleus), they journey to the orchestra pit (cytoplasm), dictating the musical score (genetic information) to the musicians (ribosomes); the musicians then perform, producing harmonious melodies (proteins), which are nuanced by the instrumentalists' expertise, resembling post-translational modifications adding functional groups or forming protein complexes.	337ef4798474dbc2a4b7bc6fc3a46f58	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's talk protein synthesis like we're preppin' a clam bake in the North End. First off, mRNA's like your shopping list, headin' outta the nucleus (that'd be your house) to the ribosome (the market). Next, tRNA's like your shopping cart, grabbing amino acids (clams and corn) based on the mRNA codon (list). Thirdly, peptide bonds are made between these amino acids, kinda like you tie up the clams and corn together in a bag. Lastly, once the protein's all cooked up, it gets folded into its final structure - the way you'd set up your clam bake table. It's ain't no child's play but that's protein synthesis for ya.	77bde90c7724f383798ab9631645a459	-1	-1
5	Sure, no problem. So, protein synthesis is a bit like baking a braai broodjie at a lekker family gathering.  1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the recipe stepping out of your ouma's cookbook - it carries the instructions for the perfect broodjie.  2. Then comes translation, which is when your tannie reads and interprets that recipe into a language that the kitchen can understand - this is happening in the ribosomes.  3. Next is the translocation step, basically your boet going to fetch all the ingredients (amino acids).  4. Lastly, there's the elongation phase - this is when all those ingredients are put together to form a chain, just like your broodjie being assembled before it hits the grill. 5. Termination, well, that's when your broodjie is perfectly toasted and it's removed from the heat - similarly, protein synthesis ends when the stop codon is reached in mRNA sequence.	979b1abaeb717889df026be1799300dc	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here it goes. First off, mRNA departure from the nucleus is like a Toronto commuter departing Union Station during rush hour – direct and swift. Secondly, similar to how a Vancouver chef meticulously prepares ingredients, the ribosome reads mRNA's codons. Thirdly, tRNA plays a role akin to Edmonton's diligent delivery drivers, bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome based on mRNA's instructions. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together like a carefully crafted Montreal-style bagel chain, forming a protein.	33bd1671a6f14d31205898d06a862efc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a complex recipe: 1. Transcription, like reading the recipe, occurs in the nucleus - DNA is rewritten as mRNA. 2. mRNA migration, similar to taking the recipe to the kitchen, involves mRNA moving from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 3. Translation, or cooking according to the recipe, happens in ribosomes where tRNA deciphers mRNA codes into specific amino acids. 4. Finally, post-translational modification and folding, like adding final touches and presentation of a dish, involves further alteration and folding of proteins into their functional shapes.	765e4d9382c153946aa21b7867514a65	-1	-1
5	A'right, protein synthesis is a bit like craftin' a kilt. First, the mRNA skites oot the nucleus like a wee laddie lettin' school oot - that's transcription. Then, this RNA gets read by the ribosome, as if it were followin' a sewin' pattern - that's translation. Next, the tRNA brings in the amino acids, just like ye'd gather up yer tartan cloth pieces, tae be added in the right order. Last, these amino acids get stitched together in a long chain to create the protein, much like ye'd sew together yer bits of tartan to make the kilt.	c7d250f992e0b0278b581300a6a4aba2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, is akin to a meticulous cook following a recipe. Firstly, the mRNA, like a recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box), heads into the cytoplasm (the kitchen), where it meets the ribosome (the cook). Secondly, Transfer RNA (tRNA), similar to ingredients, binds to the mRNA and provides amino acids according to the codon sequence (the recipe steps). In subsequent peptide bond formation (like combining ingredients), the polypeptide chain grows. Lastly, after the stop codon is reached, translation ends and our protein 'dish' is complete and ready for folding and modification (final cooking processes) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.	64b7ec86f6ffe646c555a225f45d4cc5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, can be likened to a chef following a recipe. First, the chef (mRNA) leaves the recipe book (nucleus) and moves to the kitchen (cytoplasm); second, he reads the recipe (transcription), which involves the creation of an ingredient list (tRNA); third, he gathers and combines these ingredients in a specific order (translation), creating a unique dish (protein); finally, the dish undergoes finishing touches like garnishing and plating (protein folding and post-translational modifications), rendering it ready for service.	62b874594edd1d85612921f43e97ffa5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is rather like a well-rehearsed theatrical play, with mRNA playing the role of the script that exits the nucleus (stage door), then being interpreted by the ribosome (director) in a process called translation. Transfer RNA molecules (actors) read the script meticulously and gather the correct amino acids (costumes), which are then joined together in a precise sequence to form a protein (performance), demonstrating the exquisite complexity of this biological spectacle.	13e08d29b57f3702b998eabe6d4a18e0	-1	-1
5	"The process of protein synthesis is like preparing a traditional Irish meal. First, the ""recipe"" (mRNA) leaves the ""cookbook holder"" (the nucleus), then it's read by the ""chef"" (the ribosome), that's been around donkey's years and knows his stuff. Next, the chef gets the ""ingredients"" (tRNA carrying amino acids) to form a perfect ""stew"" (protein). Finally, it's off to the ""table"" (rough endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasm) for ""serving"" the stew, but if things go arseways, there could be a puck in our dish which might need further ""seasoning"" (protein folding and processing). It's a dance as old as time with each step vital to keep the craic going in our cells."	dc22ab1c23c5af2f764a5c1cd9fad9cc	-1	-1
5	Well, let me tell ya. It's kinda like a real long trip from your house to the county fair. First off, mRNA takes leave of the nucleus like you'd step out your front door, carryin' with it the blueprint for the protein that's to be made, much like the fair ticket. Then it hops on a ribosome in the cytoplasm, just as you'd get in your pick-up truck. The ribosome reads this here blueprint and tRNA (Transfer RNA) brings each specific amino acid over to the ribosome, like you stoppin' by each food stall to pick up your hush puppies and corn dogs. Finally, the amino acids link together to form the new protein - sorta like how all that fair food comes together to make one heck of a meal!	fcfce2d7bb8e36ff4c37de5625556bc8	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, like a blueprint, first leaves the nucleus carrying genetic instructions needed to create proteins. 2. It then travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, similar to a construction site where it attaches itself. 3. The tRNA, acting like delivery trucks, bring amino acids to the ribosome. 4. Lastly, these amino acids are assembled into a protein chain following the sequence defined by mRNA, just like workers at a factory assembling a product based on their blueprints.	2cfe7fb64a407b6350f6c4e25babc336	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leavin' de nucleus be like a messenger tekkin' off from headquarters wit' critical info. It's de first step inna protein makin'. 2. Next, mRNA link up wid the ribosome - dat be like finding de right workshop to get de job done. 3. Den, tRNA come in, carrying amino acids. Dis like workmen bringin' in de tools and parts for buildin'. 4. Last, these amino acids bind together to form a protein, just like how you put dem parts together to build a car or a house.	e88ce9393d2ac8ea28a982d0aecba4f9	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exiting the Nucleus: Like an individual leaving their house with a grocery list, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell carrying the genetic instructions from DNA for protein synthesis. 2. Translation Initiation: The mRNA then encounters a ribosome - akin to our individual finding a shopping cart - which will act as the site for protein synthesis. 3. Elongation: As the individual picks up items (amino acids) listed in the grocery list (mRNA), tRNA brings specific amino acids to the ribosome where they are linked together in a chain that matches the sequence dictated by the mRNA's code, expanding their shopping cart's contents (the protein chain). 4. Termination and Protein Folding: Finally, like checking out at the grocery store signifies the end of shopping, reaching a stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis. The protein (like our bagged groceries), now a long chain of amino acids, folds into its final 3D structure before going off to do its assigned job within or outside of the cell.	80f5dcb2cc84a2ef09168c7d48c4e14c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transcription: Like a diligent scribe copying a sacred text, the DNA in the nucleus is transcribed to form mRNA. 2. mRNA Exportation: Like a messenger on a mission, the newly formed mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. 3. Translation Process: Acting like an interpreter between languages, the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and translates it into amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Like origami, the chain of amino acids folds into complex shapes to form a functional protein.	f948f6bffacf6b8c208b8dc083c03d35	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here we go. Imagine protein synthesis like a good ol' fashioned county fair production line. First up, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus like a greased pig at the fair, carryin' the instructions for our protein - that's called transcription. Then, it saunters on over to this little fella called a ribosome, and that's where the real magic happens, much like pie judging at the fair - this part's known as translation. Next, tRNA molecules, each holdin' an amino acid, come together like a potluck dinner and match up with the mRNA template. Finally, those amino acids are linked up tighter than bark on a tree to form a brand-spankin'-new protein.	ba24172635442390a73fe8829a3a3817	-1	-1
5	Awrite, so imagine this process like a wee courier company. First off, mRNA's like the dispatch message leavin' the nucleus (the dispatch office). Then, it goes tae the ribosome (like the delivery van) in the cytoplasm. Here, tRNA molecules (like those posties carryin' their bags o' parcels) bring the correct amino acids (the parcels themselves) based on the code from the mRNA. Finally, these amino acids are linked together to form a protein (akin tae deliverin' all yer parcels to the right place at once), completing the process.	0272ff4609276fe0592946e90e4f39c4	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: This process is akin to a scribe writing down a spoken message, where the DNA language in the nucleus is transcribed into mRNA.  2. mRNA Processing: Similar to editing a film, unnecessary segments (introns) are cut out and the meaningful segments (exons) are spliced together to create a coherent narrative. 3. Translation: This is like translating a foreign language into your local tongue, where the mRNA travels to the ribosome and its sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence. 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, akin to origami, the amino acid chain folds into complex 3D shapes to form functional proteins.	f9a8f164705cc05bed29fee6162c1abd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA's departure from the nucleus, can be likened to a chef following a recipe. Transcription is like copying the recipe from a cookbook (DNA), while mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to taking this copied recipe into the kitchen. Translation, in which ribosomes read the mRNA recipe and assemble corresponding amino acids, resembles the cooking process. Lastly, protein folding is like presenting the dish - proteins fold into specific shapes that allow them to perform their functions effectively, just as a beautifully presented dish is more appealing and functional.	f840e23fcb820b6834ba499cc94cce1e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to a busy factory assembly line. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus like a blueprint, then it's read by ribosomes (the workers), tRNA brings in amino acids (building blocks) according to the blueprint, and finally, these amino acids are linked together to form a protein (finished product).	a3ae5bad6897ed3efa9936db15338a35	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, after mRNA leaves the nucleus, is akin to an architect's blueprint being turned into a building. Firstly, in transcription, the 'blueprint' (mRNA) is created using the 'master plan' (DNA) within the nucleus; it then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Secondly, during translation at the ribosome - or 'construction site', this blueprint is read by 'builders' (tRNA), which add specific 'building blocks' (amino acids). Next, these building blocks are linked together in a specific order to form a polypeptide chain - think of this as assembling bricks according to the blueprint. Finally, protein folding occurs where this chain folds into a three-dimensional shape - a critical step that's similar to giving our constructed building its final shape and structure.	294f40050ce375187b4b51e054db745f	-1	-1
5	Well, fuhst off, ya got the mRNA leavin' the nucleus, right? That's kinda like rush houah traffic flowin' outta downtown. Next up is translation, where the mRNA gets read by the ribosome - that's like a wicked smaht school kid deciphering a tricky word problem. Then comes elongation, where tRNA brings in amino acids to build the protein chain - kinda like a construction crew layin' bricks for a new buildin'. Lastly, there's termination, when the stop codon signals the end of protein synthesis - like closin' time at your local Bahston pub.	527697496fd7da35323f3f66f52c0989	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mate. Firstly, mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a footballer sprinting off the bench onto the pitch, carrying the strategic game plan. Next, it enters the cytoplasm - this step is similar to wandering in the veld with a specific direction. Here, it joins up with a ribosome, as a team coming together before a rugby match. Lastly, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to that ribosome, very much like a delivery van bringing supplies to a shop - these are then joined together to form a protein, strong as a lion and high as the Drakensberg.	5846e9caf97601a1a4ab0db46fe30f4d	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis, similar to a cross-country journey from Toronto to Vancouver, starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, just like a train leaves Union Station. Next is translation where mRNA's message is read, akin to stopping in Winnipeg to decode road signs. Then comes tRNA bringing amino acids, much like a prairie farmer delivering wheat. Lastly, these amino acids form a protein, as solid as the towering Rockies reaching the Pacific coast.	4365372c3069134c029361e26345a5ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a well-planned construction project. The mRNA serves as the blueprint that leaves the project manager's office (nucleus), then it's read by the site workers (ribosomes) in the cytoplasm in a process called translation, where each three-base 'word' (codon) corresponds to an amino acid, like specific types of building materials. These materials (amino acids) are then assembled into a structure (protein) by the workers guided by the tRNA molecules acting as diligent delivery trucks. Lastly, the finished protein, like a newly-built house, is folded and processed for its final function or destination.	055420a6ecb64ae33f7d5821ad718962	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's hou ye kin think aboot protein synthesis. Firrst off, mRNA skites oot the nucleus like a wee lad fleein schuil at hometime, carryin' the master plan for makin' proteins. This is follae'd by translation whaur tRNA, acting like a braw cook in the kitchen, reads the mRNA recipe and collects the right amino acids. Neist up is peptide bond formation; it's a bit like buildin' a wa', wi each amino acid bein' a stane that's added tae the growin' protein chain. Finally, ye've got protein foldin', whaur it shapes itsel into a 3D structure - just as ye'd fold clothes intae a drawer for stowage.	063e677eef09d8be29ca72394c95b576	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is much like a well-orchestrated production, with mRNA being the script that leaves the director's cabin (nucleus). The four major acts include: 1) mRNA transcription in the nucleus, where the DNA's code is rewritten into a mobile script; 2) mRNA translation in the ribosome, where it's interpreted by tRNA 'actors' who bring in amino acids, the building blocks; 3) peptide bonding, akin to actors linking hands to form a chain, creating a polypeptide; 4) protein folding, where this chain twists and folds into a unique shape, like set pieces forming the final stage set.	db794e616d295a8ca80081966399d89c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to the process of building a house. The mRNA leaving the nucleus serves as the blueprint (House Plan) which is read and interpreted by the ribosomes (Construction Workers), tRNA brings the correct amino acids (Building Blocks) in the right sequence as per the plan, forming a chain or a polypeptide (House Structure), and finally this structure folds into functional proteins (Completed House).	ca6bc4ccb49051d9f7fb33ba3d548597	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's a metaphorical take on it. Protein synthesis is like constructing a building, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus (the architect with the blueprint). The four main steps are:  1. Transcription (drafting plans) – where the DNA's instructions for making a protein are transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus. 2. mRNA processing (approving and finalising plans) – where the newly transcribed mRNA is refined and prepared for its journey to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. 3. Translation (building construction) – where tRNA molecules interpret the mRNA's instructions to add specific amino acids, building up the protein structure at the ribosomes. 4. Protein Folding (interior setup) – where the linear chain of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional shape, enabling it to perform its biological function.	135eed5cdc11273649a4ff1060880e95	-1	-1
5	Sure, I'll give it a lash.  Starting off, mRNA makes its escape from the nucleus as swift as a hare in March. It then meets up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where it's read like an open book at a poetry night. This process, known as translation, is as precise as a master weaver at his loom, ensuring every word (or amino acid) is in the correct order. Like getting a perfectly poured pint of stout, each protein is then folded into its unique structure and finally, it heads off to work, sound as a pound, performing whatever job it was made for in the cell.	897f9af5d41b477d1bf32cb870bcb8f8	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, think of it like this: The mRNA leavin' the nucleus is like your momma givin' you a grocery list. First you gotta get the list (mRNA exitin' the nucleus), next you gotta decode what's on it (translation), then you gotta find all the ingredients in the store (tRNA bringin' amino acids), after that it's time to check out and pay (peptide bonds form), and lastly, you gonna cook up somethin' good (the protein).	786db5e78e2cf98333637e257ea8167e	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA Exit & Journey to Ribosome: This is akin to a blueprint for a building leaving the architect's office, carrying critical information to the construction site, which, in this case, is the ribosome.   2. Initiation of Translation: Once the mRNA reaches the ribosome, it acts like an instruction manual being opened for the first time, priming the ribosome machinery to start translating the code into a protein sequence. 3. Elongation: This is much like a factory production line where amino acids are added one by one to the growing protein chain according to the specifications provided in the mRNA blueprint. 4. Termination & Protein Release: Imagining this as a finished product coming off an assembly line, once the protein synthesis is complete, it detaches from the ribosome and goes into the cell to perform its function.	d8810c4a53586d410a91dbf6d357f21c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a royal decree leaving the castle, mRNA carries genetic instructions from the nucleus to the ribosome. 2.

Amino Acid Linkage: Similar to piecing together a necklace, these amino acids are linked together in a specific order to form a protein. 4. Protein Folding: Like origami, the linear protein chain folds into a unique shape necessary for its function.	753d5c46acebaaf10c3676f24bf4b5cc	-1	-1
5	Well, first off ya got your mRNA leavin' the nucleus, kinda like a kid flyin' the coop for the first time. Then there's initiation where this molecule is caught faster than a jackrabbit on a date by the ribosome. The next step's elongation, where tRNA molecules are workin' harder than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest to assemble amino acids into a protein chain. And finally comes termination, when the protein synthesis is finished and it's time to call it a day, just like when the cows come home at sunset.	dcffab0c156eb1671cebb3177512dd76	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, pal! Think of it like weans makin' a jigsaw puzzle. Step one: mRNA scoots out the nucleus, kind of like a wee bairn leaving primary school with his report card, ready to show it to the big world. Step two: it enters the cytoplasm and meets up with the ribosome, that's like the headmaster checking over the report card. Step three: tRNA comes into play, carrying specific amino acids - imagine this as if each amino acid is a piece of our puzzle. Finally, step four is translation, where these amino acids are joined together to form a protein - that's our finished jigsaw puzzle, all complete and ready to be boasted about!	a9f02769e3350b8bef55765663e9bace	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: Consider this as a coded message leaving the control centre (nucleus) of a city (the cell).  2. Ribosome Binding: This is akin to the coded message being handed over to a specialist constructor (the ribosome), who interprets it. 3. tRNA Matching and Protein Assembly: Imagine the specialist constructor using specific building blocks (amino acids brought by tRNA) to construct a unique structure (protein). 4. Protein Folding and Release: Picture this as the final product undergoing finishing touches (folding into a 3D shape) before being dispatched for use or export, completing the process of protein synthesis.	cd49a4d7ab3597a9bb6460c82fd1bfa4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a coded message leaving the headquarters, the mRNA, carrying genetic information, exits the nucleus and moves to the cytoplasm.  2. Ribosome Assembly: This is like the construction site where the protein will be built. The mRNA docks onto a ribosome where the code it carries will direct the sequence of amino acids in the protein. 3. tRNA Matching: tRNAs act as delivery trucks, each one bringing specific amino acids (the building blocks) to add to the protein chain according to the mRNA’s instructions. 4. Protein Elongation: The protein chain grows much like building a wall brick by brick, each amino acid added extends the length of the protein until it's complete and ready for use within or outside of the cell.	b2e205b5411a1e1f32999011ceae4f03	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a complex cooking recipe. The first step, transcription, is akin to writing down the recipe from the main recipe book (DNA in the nucleus) onto a portable note (mRNA), which can freely leave the kitchen (nucleus). In the second step, mRNA migrates from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, just like carrying that portable note into another room where all the ingredients (amino acids) are. This is followed by translation, which is like reading and following the recipe, where every three bases on mRNA (codon) instructs which ingredient (amino acid) to add next. Lastly, as in any recipe, there's folding - the linear sequence of amino acids folds into a specific 3D structure to form a functioning protein, similar to how our cooked dish needs to be presented properly for it to be appetizing and effective.	bba7f1be7cbfbf67bbaa33981be414a5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a carefully orchestrated production in a factory. The mRNA, acting as the detailed blueprint, leaves the control room (nucleus) and heads towards the ribosomes (workstations), where transfer RNA (tRNA) or 'delivery trucks' bring in specific amino acids (building materials). These are then assembled in the exact sequence specified by the mRNA blueprint into a polypeptide chain (the finished product), which itself folds into a functional protein (a ready-to-market item), all under the careful guidance of various enzymes (factory supervisors).	a7b3b45e2f022e19438a6b449980911d	-1	-1
5	A'ight, so imagine mRNA as a wicked smaaht recipe book that's been kept under lock and key in the nucleus, which we're going to call the kitchen safe. First up, there's this thing called transcription, kinda like when yah copy down Nana's famous clam chowder recipe onto a new piece of paper, that's your mRNA leaving the nucleus. Then it gets over to this thing called translation, sorta like if you took that copied recipe to your buddy Vinny who works down at the docks and he starts gathering all the ingredients together (in this case, amino acids) using the mRNA as his guide; that right there is the ribosome doin' its job. Third step's peptide bond formation -- just like Vinny stringing together those ingredients to start makin' that chowder. The final step is called protein folding - think of it like letting chowder simmer till all the flavours meld together into a hearty bowl--that's your protein ready to go. That’s pretty much what's goin' on in there, kid.	49396ed36f0d1e692ef7bfa7ebd2e736	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing, boet! So, the story of protein synthesis is a bit like organising a big bash in Mzansi.  First off, you've got your ""save the date"", which is like the mRNA leaving the nucleus. This is the ""Go!"" signal, ek se. Then, it's braai time with the ""ribosome"" acting as our braai master - this is called translation initiation where the assembly of amino acids begins. It's like throwing your boerewors and chops on the grill. Next, we've got the elongation phase, or as we'd say in SA, when everybody's jolling and the party's kicking like a veld fire. This is where amino acids are added one by one, extending the protein like a conga line at a sokkie. Lastly, there's the termination phase - when Oom Piet falls asleep in his chair and everyone knows it's time to dash. This is when the completed protein is released, signaling the end of protein synthesis. There you go mate, protein synthesis described as lekker as a Sunday braai!"	68ee6b0b51a1e26faf0ebe33f0d2ef3d	-1	-1
5	Alright, picture protein synthesis like a well-organized hockey game. First up, mRNA is like the all-star player, swiftly exiting the locker room (nucleus) after being briefed with strategic plays (DNA instructions). Once on the ice (cytoplasm), the mRNA is met by ribosomes, acting as coaches, guiding our all-star, reading the strategies (codons) and ensuring a smooth match (translation). The tRNA enters the scene next, similar to equipment managers providing amino acids (equipment) to the ribosome and mRNA complex (players and coaches). This activity builds up a growing polypeptide chain (team strategy) ultimately becoming a functional protein, the winning goal of the match.	18054d052642274e10e3fbb0389a6bae	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Protein synthesis, after mRNA leaves the nucleus, can be seen as a multi-step recipe for baking a cake.  1. Transcription: This is like writing down your cake recipe on a piece of paper; in the cell's nucleus, DNA serves as a template to create mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: This step is akin to proofreading and editing that recipe, where introns (non-coding sections) are removed, and exons (coding sections) are spliced together to form mature mRNA. 3. Translation: Using your edited recipe, you then gather your ingredients - just like how the mRNA binds to ribosomes in the cytoplasm and tRNA brings in amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, analogous to baking and allowing the cake to take shape under heat, the sequence of amino acids folds into a unique three-dimensional structure to form a functional protein.	c4dcdb4018b1e29d31f64c8da2839082	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae protein synthesis is a bit like bakin' a cake. The mRNA leaves the nucleus (that's yer recipe book), then it hits transcription in the cytoplasm whaur it gets read provide instructions (like readin' the recipe). It moves on tae rRNA in the ribosome, this forms a complex with tRNA which is like gatherin' all yer ingredients together. Then we have translation where the protein chain is elongated wi' amino acids, that's like mixin' aw the ingredients together. Finally, th' protein folds intae its final shape - this is like puttin' the cake in the oven and lettin' it bake intae its final form.	0f0707e8c8390a42aaca9fa76b9a42ac	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis can be likened to a complex factory production line. First, the mRNA, acting as the blueprint, leaves the nucleus (the control center) and travels to the ribosomes (the assembly lines) in the cytoplasm. This is known as transcription. Then, the ribosome reads the mRNA code and assembles amino acids into a specific sequence via a process called translation, essentially building the product. Next, transfer RNA (tRNA), playing the role of delivery trucks, pick up the specific amino acids required from around the cell and bring them to the ribosome to be added to the growing protein chain. Finally, once each amino acid has been added in the correct order, the finished protein is released and folds into its specific shape to perform its task within or outside the cell.	35cbf270c1642ad0c8c899e176b5960a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, is akin to a well-orchestrated concert. First, in a process known as transcription and similar to an orchestra conductor interpreting sheet music, mRNA is produced by copying DNA's genetic instructions within the nucleus. Second, mRNA, akin to a messenger conveying the conductor's directives, leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Thirdly, translation happens where mRNA's message is read by ribosomes (the musicians), which then create protein chains based on these instructions. Lastly, these chains fold into their final form, much like how individual musical notes meld together to create a melody, resulting in the finished protein.	f14e4a8dca59e2a18ba1ea0f9c8059f1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, similar to a well-organised production line, incorporates four critical steps after mRNA leaves the nucleus. Step 1 is mRNA transportation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, akin to delivering blueprints to a factory floor; step 2 is the translation process where ribosomes, much like skilled craftsmen, decode mRNA into amino acids; step 3 is the tRNA's role in bringing specific amino acids, comparable to delivery of exact materials; and final step 4 is the formation of polypeptide chains, which can be likened to assembly of those materials into a finished product, forming a protein.	310b030d7ad5937d1a173608f96e933a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a merry dance that kicks off when mRNA bids farewell to the nucleus and heads out on the never never. The first step, like finding hen's teeth, involves mRNA acting as a blueprint in the ribosome during translation - it's been decoding this information for donkey's years. Next up, tRNA comes into play, bringing along amino acids based on codons from mRNA, like a diligent postman with his parcels. At the third trot, these amino acids are joined together in a polypeptide chain, as if they're linking arms in an Irish jig. In the final act, after mRNA has played its part and darts off, these chains fold into complex 3D structures to become proteins - it's like moving from a simple ceili dance to Riverdance in no time flat.	bb699392debb395f37a0d59cf50e4446	-1	-1
5	Well now, y'all asked about protein synthesis, didn't ya? Let me break that down for you.  1. First off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus just like a cat with its tail on fire, carryin' the genetic info from the DNA. That's one heck of a message to carry, kinda like getting the blueprints for buildin' a tractor. 2. Next up, it waltzes on over to the ribosome in the cytoplasm - think of this as our workshop, where all the heavy liftin' gets done. 3. Now here comes tRNA like an old delivery truck, bringin' in amino acids (the building blocks) based on the mRNA blueprint. This right here's like choosin' the right parts for our tractor. 4. Finally, all them amino acids get strung together by peptidyl transferase to make a protein - that's your shiny new tractor ready to plow fields! So there you have it, protein synthesis is just buildin' a tractor from scratch, but on a teeny tiny scale. Now ain't that something?	c47f5194413ab9320b3b1d2fb588f53a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a messenger embarking on a journey with important news.  2.

Next, tRNA molecules transport specific amino acids to the ribosome, akin to delivery trucks bringing the right ingredients (amino acids) to our chef (ribosome). Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that matches with the codon on the mRNA. 4. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together in a polypeptide chain according to the order specified by the mRNA sequence. This would be similar to our chef (ribosome) following the recipe (mRNA) exactly, combining each ingredient (amino acid) in the precise order to create a delicious dish (protein).

Polypeptide Formation: This is like building a wall brick by brick, where each brick is an amino acid brought by tRNA, forming a chain (protein).	2e378375d217a927716c52860d166de4	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Protein synthesis, that's like a well-choreographed dance routine out here on the farm. First off, mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus like a dog escaping a hot barn, carrying the DNA's instructions. That's step one. Next, it heads to the ribosome - think of this like the kitchen table where all the work gets done. That's where translation happens, which is about as complicated as a Sunday potluck dinner; tRNA brings in the right amino acids, kind of like bringing dishes to share. They all get strung together in the right order, guided by mRNA's blueprint. This forms a polypeptide chain - basically a long string of pearls made from amino acids. Lastly, this string folds up into a functional protein, kinda like how you'd fold a quilt. Each fold and bend makes it work just right. It's not something you see every day unless you're looking for it, but it's as essential to life as rain is for crops.	d1a53630a818697521b67760c085ee06	-1	-1
5	Right, imagine protein synthesis as makin' a piece of tartan cloth. The mRNA leavin' the nucleus is like the pattern for the tartan gettin' passed onto the weaver. Step one, transcription, is akin to the weaver readin' the pattern; the DNA is unwound and copied into mRNA. Step two, translation, is like the weaver pickin' out the right coloured threads, where tRNA matches up wi' codons on the mRNA to bring in the correct amino acids. Step three, peptide bond formation, is like weavin' the threads together; amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds to form a protein chain. Finally, step four, protein folding, is like the finished piece of tartan bein' folded into its final shape; the protein chain folds into a specific 3D shape that determines its function.	f6322cbc4afacc95ccd68b00aad5ff64	-1	-1

5	Well now, sugar, think of it like this: mRNA's a bit like a sweet little courier, zippin' out the nucleus with a very important message. It heads over to that ribosome, slower than molasses in January, and starts the process we call translation. Like a loom weavin' a fancy rug, tRNA molecules match up their anticodons with the mRNA's codon sequence, stitchin' together those amino acids into a polypeptide - the first step to creatin' a protein. With the help of enzymes, these chains fold on up into our final product. Now ain't that a hard row to hoe?	387eb6766e23ff1724c29c35102a934d	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is a simplified answer: 1. mRNA Exit: The mRNA, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus like an important letter leaving the post office. 2. Translation: The mRNA attaches to the ribosome, much like a key fitting into its lock. 3. tRNA Matching: tRNA molecules match their anticodons with mRNA codons in a dance-like sequence matching song lyrics to music notes. 4. Protein Formation: Amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a protein, akin to attaching individual pearls to create a beautiful necklace.	94309437efcfc44f3ea7deceb66a646a	-1	-1
5	"One, mRNA say ""bye bye"" to nucleus just like a boat leaving harbor, ready for a big journey. Two, mRNA meet up with ribosome - that's like the boat reaching a new island. Three, transfer RNA (tRNA) come along; it be like the crew on the boat bringing different goods (amino acids). Four, these goods then join up in a special order to form protein, just like how we put together pieces to build a house."	52e8be3c135a023c73ca5ff1f2a29293	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, is like a well-choreographed dance. First, mRNA, the choreographer, leaves the nucleus, or the dance studio, carrying the dance routine (the genetic code for a protein) to be performed. Second, in a process called translation at the ribosomes (our stage), tRNA (dancers) interpret the mRNA's instructions and assemble amino acids (dance moves) into a polypeptide chain (the full dance routine). The third step involves checking and proofreading done by editing systems that assure the amino acid sequence is correct and adjustments are made if necessary—just like a dance teacher correcting and perfecting moves. Finally, the finished protein (final dance routine), is dispatched to perform its function in the cell—like a dance being performed on stage!	bbd7bfe4603881d39b10983f52c002fa	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a royal message, mRNA exits the nucleus carrying genetic instructions from the DNA. 2. Ribosome Reading: The mRNA, like secret code, is translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm.  3. tRNA Matching: tRNA acts as the perfect matchmaker, bringing together amino acids and corresponding mRNA codons to bind them. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Like a skilled blacksmith forging links in a chain, the ribosome bonds these amino acids together into a polypeptide chain, creating the backbone of the protein.	7cfc6ebee78728bf76c6e6012a173d59	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, protein synthesis is like cookin' up grandma's famous hotdish. First off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date, carrying the recipe. Then, it meets with the ribosome, which is like our stovetop where the magic really starts to happen. The tRNA, that's like your measuring cup, brings in amino acids--those are like our ingredients. These ingredients get strung together into a chain based on mRNA recipe - this here is called the translation. Lastly, these chains fold up tighter than bark on a tree into 3D structures to form the proteins. There ya have it!	5c8d97b4570e761f479a2a6d1d1a3bcf	-1	-1
5	Sure thing pal, let's get started on this.  First off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus like a wee lassie chasin' her fitba' down the park, that's transcription. Then in translation, the ribosomes grab a hold of it, readin' it like yer favourite book at bedtime, turnin' those codons into amino acids. Next up is tRNA - it's like yon postie deliverin' the right parcels (amino acids) to the right addresses (ribosomes). Finally, these amino acids join together like best pals at a ceilidh, form a protein, an voila - yer set! That's protein synthesis for you.	12cf593d0458678d1f0ad56fab5fbb5e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a thrilling journey! Picture this: mRNA is like a coded message exiting the control centre (nucleus), it travels to the protein factories (ribosomes) that are the bustling industrial zones of the cell. Here, decoding begins with tRNA being like skilled workers interpreting the code and arranging amino acids, which are like building blocks, in the correct sequence. This forms polypeptide chains, similar to assembling a complex Lego structure. Finally, these chains fold into a specific shape - imagine origami performed with precision - to yield a complete protein, ready for action!	a47c61a384b8793e743179d1dd0b079d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a series of steps that can be compared to a well-rehearsed play. Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus (our backstage), it then reaches the ribosome, our main stage, where it performs the act of translation, transforming its coded message into an amino acid sequence (actors entering the stage in a specific order). This sequence, which is like a carefully choreographed dance routine, then folds into a unique 3D structure or protein (the climax of our play). Finally, for some proteins, further modifications and additions are done (like the accessory of costumes) before they take on their roles in the body's cellular functions - The final curtain call.	267c4ea301058b1ab9858ed243c42c47	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is like an exquisite dance that begins in the nucleus with mRNA as the lead dancer. This dance has four major steps:  1. Exit from Nucleus: The mRNA, carrying the gene's coded message, bravely exits the nucleus just like a dancer stepping onto a stage.     2. Translation Initiation: This is akin to the opening music; when mRNA attaches to the ribosome (the music player), it signals the start of protein synthesis. 3. Elongation: Like the main act of the dance, using the code from mRNA, tRNA brings in amino acids (the dance steps) and places them in order, creating a chain. 4. Termination: Just as every performance ends with a final pose, when the stop codon appears on mRNA, it signals the end of protein synthesis and releases the newly formed protein (the completed routine).	a16b2966e4389402e08fa189eda5b052	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA departure from the nucleus, is akin to an intricate theatre production. The mRNA, our 'script', exits the 'backstage' nucleus and enters the 'stage' of the cytoplasm where it is read by the 'actor' ribosome; tRNA then translates this into 'dialogue', delivering specific amino acids to create a chain, effectively the 'performance'; finally, these chains fold into 3D structures, the final curtain call which marks the creation of a protein.	2c1f173ff7d5dac725cd3b886fe5d5e5	-1	-1
5	A'right, kid, think of it like this: mRNA leavin' the nucleus is like the Sox leavin' Fenway, headin' for a road series. First stop’s translation initiation; this is where the Sox, or mRNA, start to assemble their team on the ribosome's field. Next up, we got elongation, longer than a Red Sox-Yankees game in extra innings; here, amino acids (the players) are added one by one to form a protein. Then we've got termination—like the end of a sweet doubleheader—where the newly formed protein (a victorious Sox team) is released. And finally, protein folding - that's when the team gets into formation, sharper'n a Sox fan's wit. Just remember that sometimes these proteins don't fold right and need chaperones, sorta like when rookies make an error and need some guidance from the veterans to get back on track.	7135ffa2b1098f1950f844139edc6dad	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, the journey of mRNA from nucleus to protein synthesis is a bit like a baton relay race at the Comrades Marathon.  First off, the mRNA sprints out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, quick-quick, with its genetic message. This is just like when you're rushing to get a potjie on the braai before your guests arrive.  Secondly, mRNA joins up with a ribosome and begins translating that genetic message into an amino acid sequence. Picture this as if the ribosome is like a master chef deciphering a recipe. Thirdly, transfer RNA (tRNA) comes onto the scene - it's light as a feather but sure does make an impact. It matches each codon on the mRNA with its corresponding amino acid, sort of like finding the right spices for your curry. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a protein - this new protein is now as high as the Drakensberg compared to where it started! Just as you've built your perfect potjie, ready to impress your mates.	0f615621ca4ef5932c58135afaf5b6d2	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's the process of protein synthesis rolled out for you like a red carpet at TIFF. First off, mRNA zips out of the nucleus like a puck off a hockey stick, carrying the genetic code it needs. Then, like a lumberjack at a log roll, it gets to the ribosome, where tRNA comes in and matches the mRNA's code with corresponding amino acids, about as precise as a Mountie on patrol. Next up in this relay race is the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids - this forms a polypeptide chain, expanding faster than Vancouver's skyline! Finally, this chain folds into a specific structure to become our finished protein – just like folding poutine cheese curds into gravy-soaked fries, creating something bigger than a prairie sky. Voila, job done as steady as a Canuck's resolve.	7153a42bce797455422ef43b91a42d56	-1	-1
5	Envision protein synthesis like a theatrical play. mRNA exiting the nucleus is like the main character taking center stage, fraught with an encoded message it picked up from DNA (the director). Next comes translation, where tRNA (the co-actors) reads the mRNA's message and assembles amino acids (the script) in the correct sequence at ribosome (the stage). Further on, these amino acids form polypeptide chains (dialogues and actions), representing different scenes of the play. The final act is protein folding, where these chains fold into distinct shapes (the climax of the story), resulting in functional proteins that our body can use.	05d59c0ea57db5d7ab77664cc9ab6f1f	-1	-1
5	Awrite, let me gie ye a hand wi this! Protein synthesis, it's like makin' a guid hearty stew. First, th' mRNA leaves th' nucleus, that's like gettin' yer recipe. The second step is translation where the mRNA attaches tae the ribosome ye ken - that's settin' up yer pot and tools. Third, tRNA molecules carry specific amino acids tae the ribosome - this is like addin' yer ingredients in. And lastly, these amino acids are joined together to form a protein - the final stir of the pot before ye've got yerself a hearty meal!	89ea028e8e42cb7bf036fbafc89a9f8e	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is a simplified metaphorical sequence to explain the process: 1. mRNA: Consider this as a special set of instructions, like an exclusive recipe that leaves the head office (nucleus) of a food chain to be sent to their branches (cytoplasm). 2. Translation: This is like the expert chef (the ribosome) reading the recipe (mRNA) and gathering all necessary ingredients (amino acids) delivered by tRNA. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: The chef then combines these ingredients in a specific order, creating a unique dish (polypeptide chain), just as peptide bonds link amino acids together. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, the new dish undergoes finishing touches (protein folding) to get its final form and taste, akin to how the polypeptide chain folds into its functional 3D structure.	33229905067a9f8ead549242bafa1077	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is a process akin to crafting a complex recipe from a cookbook. First up is Transcription, just like writing down your recipe from a cookbook, where DNA's information is converted into mRNA inside the nucleus. The mRNA then heads, like our sous-chef, into the kitchen of the cell - the cytoplasm. Translation occurs here, similar to following the recipe instructions, where ribosomes read the mRNA and link amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Lastly is Post-translation Modification, much like garnishing and plating your dish, where this simple chain undergoes modifications like folding or adding other molecules to become a functional protein.	3d64f446ae55cb88864cea93a4b1486f	-1	-1
5	Certainly, picture protein synthesis like an intricate factory assembly line. Firstly, mRNA, the blueprint, exits the nucleus - akin to a design engineer leaving the office with plans. Secondly, this blueprint arrives at the ribosomes, or the 'factory floor'. Thirdly, tRNA collects and carries the correct amino acids - think of it as a diligent worker fetching the right parts. Finally, the ribosome connects these amino acids together forming a protein - much like assembling a car on a production line.	6694c6bdbe14f7648c96e55d4feb79e9	-1	-1
5	Bang on, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus is like firing the starting gun at a race. It's then all systems go - first stop is translation, where mRNA serves as a guide, like a roadmap to Dublin, it's decoded to build a protein. Second stop is tRNA coming into play, it’s the workhorse, strong and steady as the Rock of Cashel, carrying amino acids needed for the protein. The third landmark is ribosome, it's like an old Irish pub where everyone meets up - the mRNA and tRNA rendezvous here to create the peptide bonds. The final pitstop is when these peptide chains come together to form a complete protein - think of this stage as a grand Irish jig where each dancer joins in one after another until we have a full set.	4ef8b92b5e9306766c5874a862c644de	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, let's break this down like Granny's old biscuit recipe. When mRNA ups and leaves the nucleus, it's kinda like a hand-me-down recipe being passed along to the kitchen. Translation's the first step where our mRNA recipe is read by the ribosome, which is like your cousin who can make heads or tails of Granny's cursive. Next up, we got these tRNA molecules - they're like fetching the right ingredients from the pantry based on the mRNA recipe instructions. After that, those amino acids they fetched start linking up into a chain - much like stringin' beans for supper. Finally, once all the ingredients are mixed just right, you end up with a protein, or in our case, a delicious batch of Granny's biscuits.	3a8aa8a8e992e6e3f831dca0746f7a2e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a detailed blueprint leaving an architect's office, carrying specific instructions to be executed.  2. In the cytoplasm, mRNA meets the ribosome, which acts as the construction site where the blueprint will be brought to life. 3. Next, tRNA enters the scene, functioning like a delivery truck carrying amino acids, the building blocks needed for our protein structure. 4. These amino acids are then assembled in order according to the instructions on our 'blueprint' (mRNA), creating a unique protein, much like a complex building is built brick by brick.	2e0a38569d6d1a0d730c0d28305d4495	-1	-1
5	Alright, let me break it down for you. First, mRNA gets a ticket from de nucleus and makes its grand exit leave de building. Next, mRNA taxis to de ribosome- like going to the market place, catch my drift? Third, mRNA gets to work translating the genetic code into protein - like a cook following a recipe. Last but not least, tRNA bring in de right amino acids to build de protein - like workers bringing bricks for build a house. So, there you have it! Protein synthesis!	40c5d7918dbe520a6156ab4970e2c582	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-structured recipe that begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, akin to getting the ingredients from the pantry. The four major steps are: (1) Transcription, similar to writing down the recipe where the DNA sequence is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus; (2) mRNA Processing, which is like refining the recipe by removing unnecessary parts; (3) Translation, equivalent to following the directions of the recipe where tRNA reads and translates the mRNA sequence into amino acids in the ribosome, the kitchen of a cell; (4) Protein Folding, which can be compared to presenting the final dish where amino acids fold into a functional protein.	7b6648192eb727fc21bc06c9da6c6503	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: After creation in nucleus, mRNA is like a new blueprint leaving the architect's office, carrying plans for a new building. 2. Ribosome Reading: mRNA reaches ribosome, the construction site where workers (ribosome) read the blueprint. 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) act as delivery trucks bringing in the right materials (amino acids) that match with the plan. 4. Polypeptide Formation: The amino acids link together like bricks being laid one by one to form a wall (polypeptide chain), which will fold into a protein.	1293dc5797fef597393aabf7a42b6fda	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Imagine protein synthesis like a car assembly line. First off, mRNA skedaddles on outta the nucleus, much like a blueprint escapin' the office. Then it links up with the ribosome in the cytoplasm, kinda like how a mechanic gets his hands on said blueprint.

5	1. mRNA Departure: Imagine the mRNA as a coded message leaving the royal court (nucleus), journeying towards its destination.  2. Translation Initiation: Upon reaching the protein factories (ribosomes), the coded message (mRNA) unlocks production, similar to a key starting a car engine. 3. Elongation: Then begins an assembly line process where tRNA, akin to workers, read the code and attach proper amino acids, likened to different pieces of a model. 4. Termination: Finally, the protein chain, like a completed model, disconnects from the ribosome when the 'end' signal is interpreted, marking the end of this biological manufacturing process.	76e4378032af6a6119b2ef2426616bfb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex process that can be broken down into four key steps, much like the assembly line in a car factory.  1. mRNA Export: In this initial phase, much like the car design blueprints leaving the design room, the mRNA, which carries the genetic instructions, leaves the nucleus of the cell.  2. Translation Initiation: This phase is analogous to workers gathering necessary parts based on blueprints; Here, ribosomes read and interpret the mRNA to set up protein production. 3. Elongation: Similar to adding piece after piece to form the car structure along the conveyor belt, amino acids are added one by one to form a polypeptide chain.  4. Termination and Folding: Just as when a car is fully assembled it is inspected for final touches and adjustments, protein synthesis ends with termination where protein production stops and folding where proteins are given their three-dimensional structure necessary for their function.	d7e98d5247d39f6b25c8570989943e5b	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an analogy. Imagine protein synthesis as a factory production line. First, mRNA, carrying the blueprint (genetic code) from the nucleus (design department), travels to the cell's cytoplasm. Second, it arrives at ribosomes (factory machines), where tRNA (workers) reads the blueprint and fetches the correct amino acids (building blocks). Third, these amino acids are joined together in a specific order to form a polypeptide chain (the product being assembled). Finally, once this chain is complete and has been checked for quality control (folding and processing), it's transported to where it's needed inside or outside of the cell - just like a product ready for shipment from the factory.	5db13e2c599da1bcbd2ddf8886233d14	-1	-1

It's then that the race really begins: translation comes into play just like a veld fire taking over the plains, where tRNA brings in amino acids to build up the protein, piece by piece, small-small. This is followed by the ribosomes piecing together these amino acids, much like a beaded necklace being strung together at record speed. Lastly, once our protein is fully formed and stronger than a lion, it's carefully folded into its unique shape - just like origami - enabling it to perform its specific function in the body.	7f12ddc9626c7be8506a89cc514d129d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here we go. Think of protein synthesis like a hockey game. First, mRNA exits the nucleus like a player leaving the dressing room, it's got its play instructions (genetic code) all set. This is known as transcription. Next, it moves to the rink, which in our case is the ribosome; just as fast as a puck flies across the ice, mRNA is read and translated into amino acids, this process is called translation. Then, these amino acids are linked together in a sequence tighter than a beaver's dam to form a polypeptide chain. Lastly, just like how no two hockey players are the same, this chain folds into a unique 3D shape to form the final protein, each heavy as a moose but vital for our body functions.	fd911483ed586dfcb7f45da3821c351c	-1	-1

The second step is mRNA processing where introns are removed and exons joined together -- consider this refining your recipe, removing unnecessary ingredients. Thirdly, we have translation, where the mRNA is decoded to produce a specific protein, like following the steps of the recipe to create your dish. Finally, post-translational modifications occur where the protein undergoes various processes such as folding or being transferred to its suitable location, much like adding final garnishes or plating your dish beautifully.	2bf1b0406a3927186daa5d5e0c81130d	-1	-1

First, he takes his message - the DNA transcription - an' heads for th’ cytoplasm, nae unlike a traveler leavin’ hame.  Next, he meets up wi' the ribosome, the factory o' the cell, just as ye might meet a blacksmith in town. The tRNA then comes along, carryin' amino acids like a cart haulin' goods. These are the buildin' blocks for our protein, like stones for a castle. Then translation happens – it's like readin’ a map to figure oot where each stone goes. Each codon on th' mRNA matches up wi’ an anticodon on the tRNA, ensurin’ that each amino acid is added in th' right order. Finally, the polypeptide chain of amino acids folds into a 3D shape to form th' protein – just like how those castle stones would be built up into towers an battlements.

5	Well, protein synthesis is a bit like an old Irish jig with four main steps. First off, mRNA does a puck from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, carrying the dance instructions for the protein. Then, the ribosome, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, reads these instructions and starts the dance with tRNA bringing in the right amino acids. This dance goes on the never never until a stop codon is encountered, ending the dance and releasing the complete protein.

That ribosome starts readin' the mRNA like it's your auntie's favorite Bible verse, every three bases (or ""codons"") codes for one specific amino acid. Then tRNA struts in, all hat no cattle until it finds its match in the mRNA and plunks its amino acid into place. It's a bit of a dance, like a Saturday night hoedown--everybody gets turned around but they all end up where they need to be eventually. Last thing you know, you've got yourself a new protein, fresh as a daisy and ready for work!"	dbe6d6849d8731f1f0e3d7c984bf8292	-1	-1

Finally, just as every play has its unique cast and script, each protein is uniquely modified after folding to perform its specific role in the body (post-translational modification).	54f895d27eaf42e0fb047b6e78e8bc9e	-1	-1
5	Sure, Protein synthesis is like a factory assembly line! First up is Transcription; where the mRNA bravely leaves the nucleus carrying the blueprints (information from DNA) for protein construction. It heads to the ribosome, our production floor in the Cytoplasm, kick-starting Translation - a process where mRNA's code is read by tRNA and the amino acids are brought in, linking together like building blocks to form a protein. The polypeptide chain then folds into a unique 3D structure like origami, resulting in a functional protein. Finally, Post-Translational Modifications are made - just as final tweaks on a car assembly line - where proteins may be altered or tagged for transport to their respective workstations in the cell. So from blueprint design (mRNA transcription) to the finished product (protein), it's an intricate sequence of events that ensure our bodies function properly!	0a36c029017f02ff8fac82feaad6abb9	-1	-1
5	Sure, imagine protein synthesis like a well-organized factory production line.  1. mRNA exiting the nucleus is much like the blueprint of a product coming from the design department. It contains all the instructions on how to build that specific protein. 2. The mRNA then attaches to a ribosome (like an assembly line) in the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum, where it will be read and translated into an amino acid sequence during the process called translation. 3. The tRNA (worker bees) bring specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the code provided by the mRNA.  4. Finally, these amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain (the final product), which eventually folds up into a functional protein (a ready-to-use gadget).	6fdf11a3e1aa575989a258b76b106c53	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated factory production line. Firstly, mRNA, acting as the critical blueprint, departs the nucleus and journeys to the ribosomes, where it is interpreted much like an engineer reading a schematic. This interpretation, termed translation, prompts tRNA carrying specific amino acids to bind to the mRNA in the correct order - imagine this as workers assembling parts piece by piece. These joined amino acids form a polypeptide chain - akin to the assembly line churning out a finished product - which then undergoes folding into a functional protein, much like how a final product would be packaged and prepared for use.	ded0f6bf87a05730db4020f583a37510	-1	-1
5	Awright, kickin' it off with the mRNA sneakin' outta the nucleus like a Sox fan from a Yankees game. Then ya got yer first step, called transcription, where this guy RNA polymerase copies the DNA code into mRNA - kinda like takin' shorthand at a townie meeting. Second up, mRNA zips off to the cytoplasm faster than a Masshole cuttin' you off on the Pike. Thirdly, we got translation where the ribosome reads that mRNA code and starts buildin' a protein, just like you'd hammer together a wicked good lobster trap, one piece at a time. Lastly, tRNA brings in the amino acids, which are like the bricks for our protein buildin'. It's all busier than South Station during rush hour!	84fcb871e454a59ab0bc3ca02bc6a7d1	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's jive through this protein synthesis dance together. It starts with the mRNA doing a quickstep out of the nucleus, carrying the dance instructions for the rest of the crowd. The next twirl is when it shimmys into the ribosome, where it catches the eye of the tRNA - our trusty dance partner carrying an amino acid. They do a sakkie-sakkie, matching up perfectly. With every step, more tRNA partners join and link their amino acids together in a conga line - this is called elongation. Finally, like any good sokkie, it ends with a signal that stops the dance and releases the completed protein - ready to jol its way through the body!	ef3ff409220a8fa19ed298b89ab6d968	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, buckle up for a journey that's as fascinating and intricate as the deep forests of Canada.  1) Initiation: Picture mRNA leaving the nucleus like a hockey player bursting out onto the rink, all set to start the game. This player (mRNA) carries critical instructions from DNA within the nucleus to the cellular machinery outside. 2) Ribosome Binding: Now, our MVP mRNA needs to team up with its line mate, the ribosome, which is like the coach directing plays on the ice. The ribosome attaches itself to the mRNA and starts reading its instructions. 3) Elongation: As the ribosome continues down the mRNA, it's like a Zamboni smoothing over the ice surface. As it moves along, it brings together amino acids in the exact sequence dictated by the mRNA, creating a polypeptide chain -- that's your emerging protein. 4) Termination: Finally, just like the game buzzer sounding off at the end of the third period, there's a specific stop signal in the mRNA sequence letting the ribosome know it's time to release the newly formed protein. And voila! Our game -- or in this case, protein synthesis -- is complete!	e7a699c9cac5bf388f15cef7c69e8940	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is much like an intricate dance sequence. First, mRNA, the choreographer, leaves the nucleus (the backstage) to carry the DNA's instructions to the cytoplasm; second, the ribosome, or the stage, attaches to this mRNA; third, tRNA (the dancers) interpret the mRNA's instructions by matching up their anti-codons to mRNA's codons and delivering specific amino acids (dance moves); finally, these amino acids link together to form a protein (the final dance routine), completing the elaborate ballet of protein synthesis.	b6aedc17145cddcf9b16c7e6030f0ef9	-1	-1
5	Awrite, let's think aboot this like it's a wee journey.  First off, mRNA buggers aff from the nucleus like a dug after a rabbit, carryin' awa' the instructions for makin' the protein - that's transcription, mind ye. Then we hae the mRNA attachin' itself tae a ribosome in the cytoplasm like it's found its ain personal cosy fireside chair - this'd be the initiation of translation. Next up, tRNA molecules come along, pairin' up with the mRNA like dancers at a ceilidh, bringin' their amino acids tae the party and joinin' them together tae form a polypeptide chain, which is yer elongation phase. Finally we hae termination, where the polypeptide chain gets cut loose when the ribosome hits a stop signal on the mRNA - kind of like when the lights go up at the end of the night and it's time tae head hame. That there's protein synthesis for ye!	0df8276755b00ee44bb5db3c3d74fc9f	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Think of protein synthesis like a well-orchestrated play. Firstly, mRNA exits the stage (the nucleus), carrying the script (genetic information). Secondly, it arrives at the ribosome, which is like the main actor reading the script. Thirdly, tRNA, The co-actors, bring along amino acids - their props. Finally, these amino acids are linked together to form a protein - the final act of the play.	46aafcc784ab4b413cdbcbdf65b8d01e	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Visualize protein synthesis as a magnificent symphony with four major movements. First, mRNA, akin to the conductor, leaves the nucleus setting the tempo for the entire orchestra. That's transcription! Next, in translation, tRNA - our diligent musicians - interpret the mRNA's coded instructions (the symphony score) to assemble amino acids, an equivalent to individual musical notes. This composition of amino acids forms proteins or our symphony piece. Lastly, post-translational modifications occur where these proteins get fine-tuned just like how a composer might adjust pitch or volume to perfect the final masterpiece. Finally, the release of these proteins is similar to the symphony reaching its crescendo and being set free into the auditorium, providing essential functions within the body.	063a5b16c5bcd9ee5f6932c41ddf9f14	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, is much like a complex relay race that consists of four pivotal legs. The first leg is Transcription, where DNA's blueprint is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus, just like a quick but careful snapshot being taken; Post-Transcriptional Modifications then takes place, where the mRNA snapshot is edited and polished for clarity; this 'polished picture' then leaves the nucleus and heads to the ribosome in the third leg called Translation, which is akin to a master craftsman reading an instruction manual (mRNA) to build a protein; finally, we have Protein Folding and Processing, which is akin to the final product inspection and packaging in a factory, ensuring that the protein has been correctly made and is ready for use or delivery.	9a7e26c922312db20aacac111a2c63a3	-1	-1
5	Well, let's get this show on the road! First up to bat is transcription, where the mRNA nips out of the nucleus as fast as greased lightning, carrying a copy of the DNA sequence with it. Then we have translation where, in the ribosome’s workshop, that mRNA message gets decoded and bang on, an amino acid chain starts to form! There's protein folding next; these amino acids fold together like origami into a complex 3D shape - this is rare as hen’s teeth because it happens perfectly every time. Finally, post-translational modification steps up to the plate, adding some final touches like a cherry on top of a cake.	39d2bbeece2e77745cf0197d45964ecd	-1	-1
5	Well now, protein synthesis is kinda like setting up for a big ol' barn dance. It starts with mRNA skedaddling out the nucleus (that's the main house), then it gets read by ribosomes (like calling out dance steps), next tRNA brings in amino acids (those are the dancers now), they all join up in a polypeptide chain (think of a line dance), and finally it folds up into a functional protein (the grand finale of the dance).	ce1f76f5a6fee1ec1a7a1bcafa727ebf	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a crucial letter leaving the post office, mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, exits the nucleus of the cell. 2. Cytoplasmic Journey: The mRNA then embarks on a voyage across the cytoplasm, much like a ship sailing to distant shores.  3. Ribosome Reading: At the ribosome (the cell's protein factory), the mRNA message is read, similar to a blueprint being deciphered by an architect. 4. tRNA Translation: Finally, tRNA translates this message into a specific protein sequence - akin to a chef precisely following a recipe to prepare a dish.	6adeed9f144e50d9150d1b3561680220	-1	-1

5	Well, it's kinda like this. First off, you got your mRNA leavin' the nucleus, that's kinda like a kid leaving home to go off to college. Then, the mRNA meets up with a ribosome, kinda like how a college student would meet their professor. That's where they start readin' that mRNA to create an amino acid sequence, sort of like readin' a recipe to bake a cake. Then comes along this molecule called tRNA bringing in the right amino acids just like a grocery delivery man bringin' all the right ingredients for your cake. Last but not least, these amino acids bond together to create a protein, much like mixin' all your ingredients together to wind up with your final product, a delicious cake. It ain't easy as pie, but there you have it!	6aa6aa4cc0d72383411d0ede56d6627e	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, pal! Let's kick off wi' mRNA scramblin' oot the nucleus like a wee haggis fleein' from a hungry Scottie dog. Next step, mind, is when this RNA hits the ribosome - that's like our local pub where all the chatter happens. This is the translation phase, where mRNA's message is transformed into amino acids - think of it like decoding a secret natter into clear English. Aye and these amino acids then join together in a long chain to form a protein, sturdy as a lion and ready for work. Last but no least, these proteins might have to go through post-translational modifications - kinda like addin' the extras on your chip shop supper; doesn't look right without its batter and sauce, does it?	3a2c33842578e602996cca877441383b	-1	-1
5	1. Export from the Nucleus: Much like a master blueprint being brought out from a vault, the mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions, leaves the nucleus. 2.

Polypeptide Formation: Finally, like linking together a chain, these amino acids join in a specific order to create a polypeptide chain - the precursor to a protein.	4152648aec139ed874616f614d10b732	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like baking a cake. First, the mRNA, our recipe, leaves the nucleus (the cookbook) to reach the ribosome (the kitchen); this is called 'transcription'. Secondly, in the ribosome, 'translation' takes place where tRNA (like our ingredients) use the mRNA to form amino acid chains (our dough). Thirdly, these amino acids are being linked together by peptide bonds in a process called 'elongation' to create a long chain (like arranging layers of cake). Lastly, once the protein (the cake) is made, it undergoes 'post-translational modifications', which involve folding into its final shape and may include addition of other groups or cleavage - akin to icing and decorating our cake.	e4a9861ab491526a565831f56200d570	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like baking a cake. Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, which is like having your recipe in hand (1), it moves to the ribosome, the kitchen where the ingredients are mixed (2). Here, tRNA molecules, acting as the measuring cups and spoons, bring amino acids (the ingredients) to the ribosome where they are assembled according to the mRNA recipe (3). Finally, once all the ingredients have been added in the correct order, a polypeptide chain forms, just like the final cake emerging from the oven (4).	aeba6ae631f27a842ec8dd34c866d3c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a master chef following his carefully compiled recipe. Transcription, where the DNA's recipe for a specific protein (mRNA) is produced in the nucleus like a chef writing down his secret formula; export, where mRNA leaves the nucleus, akin to our chef taking his recipe to a different kitchen; translation, wherein ribosomes read the mRNA and assemble amino acids into proteins like our chef preparing ingredients as per his recipe; and finally, protein folding, where these newly formed proteins take their functional structures, mirroring our chef skillfully shaping his dough into its final form.	203efa8ff4187089313d5aa0a3573571	-1	-1
5	Awright, here it goes. The mRNA scoots outta the nucleus like the Sox outta Fenway after a big game, carryin' the genic blueprints. Translation's next, kinda like ordering a coffee at Dunk's - the ribosome reads the mRNA and gets tRNA to bring in the right amino acids. Then they all get stitched together, like knitting a sweater for a nor'easter in January, into a polypeptide chain. Lastly, that chain folds up into a 3D protein, sort of like how those old North End ladies fold cannoli shells, and boom you got yourself a protein.	a11bd41d75a89ede637070ddc3467199	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA bidding the nucleus cheers like a Springbok bolting from the bush, we enter the process of protein synthesis. Much like our beloved Bafana Bafana preparing for a big match, we have four crucial steps: transcription sees the DNA serving as a template to make mRNA, like the game plan; next, mRNA pulls away from the DNA and moves out of the nucleus, like players heading onto the field; in translation, mRNA on the ribosome reads the genetic information and calls in tRNA to bring matching amino acids, akin to teammates passing the ball to each other; finally, amino acids form a long chain called a protein, which is like scoring the winning goal – all parts played their role perfectly!	61c3b5e1ff47da6004052f546883ee5d	-1	-1
5	Sure, here we go: Protein synthesis is a lot like an assembly line in one of Canada's bustling factories. Starting off with mRNA departing the nucleus like a worker clocking into his shift, then it goes through four major steps: transcription (like reading the plans for the product), RNA splicing (removing any unnecessary parts from the blueprint), translation (where the ribosome translates the instructions into a tangible object or in this case a protein), and finally post-translational modifications (quality control to make sure everything is up-to-snuff just like the final inspections in a factory to ensure top quality!).	75d6c2d4fd3daddb2ca046b7140de2d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is much like a well-orchestrated assembly line. First, the mRNA, acting as a set of specific instructions, leaves the safety of the nucleus and travels to the ribosome (the factory). Next, the process of translation begins: tRNA (the assembly workers) brings its amino acids (parts) to the ribosome according to the mRNA's instructions. Finally, these amino acids are joined together in a long chain called a polypeptide - this becomes your final product, the protein.	834a89aed05b047548340af32fc4b72a	-1	-1

Translation - The ribosome acts like a factory worker, reading the mRNA code to assemble the corresponding protein. 4. Protein Folding - Similar to origami, the newly formed protein strand is folded into a complex structure to function effectively.	bead1b64fd71dc5d5caf9e9ad8829fae	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an analogy to describe the process: First, mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a traveler with a map, taking instructions to the ribosomes or 'protein factories' of the cell. Next, tRNA takes on the role of delivery trucks, bringing individual amino acids (building blocks) to the factories based on the mRNA's instructions. This process of assembling amino acids is called translation and is akin to building a house brick by brick. Finally, once the protein is formed, it folds into a specific shape like origami, which determines its function in the body.	0384368295eff634300be56edb6de2d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a meticulous process mirroring the precision of an assembly line. mRNA, akin to a blueprint, departs the nucleus and heads towards ribosomes, the 'workshop', where it partners with tRNA, the 'supplier' of amino acids. This assembly line then follows mRNA's instructions to string these amino acids together in a specific order, constructing proteins much like building a car model from scratch, piece-by-piece. Finally, once the protein is assembled, it undergoes finishing touches through folding, which can be likened to perfecting the car's design for its ultimate function.	2f4871724feaf92f5bb686ccbf5cb71d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, I'll explain it as solid as the Rock of Cashel. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus like a hare in a meadow, carrying the genetic info it's gotten from DNA. Next up, it enters the cytoplasm and latches onto a ribosome, much like a lad at the pub grabbing his favourite pint. Then, as dependable as a farmer to his fields, tRNA brings along amino acids, matching them with the mRNA codons. And finally, these amino acids are linked together arseways to form the protein. But remember, like paying anything on the never never, mistakes can happen leading to incorrect proteins being made!	d0f28a2929f474b420a0c4413ae40d00	-1	-1
5	Well now, protein synthesis is somethin' like a good ol' Southern kitchen. First off, the mRNA, that's your recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and heads to the ribosome (the cook). Next up, tRNA (ingredients) hook up with the mRNA at the ribosome to start the cookin', what we call translation. Then, these tRNA bring in their amino acids (the fixins') which get strung together just right to create a protein (a delicious meal). Finally, that there protein gets folded into its proper shape for use, much like how you gotta fold a biscuit dough before bakin'. Now ain't that some food for thought?	d8d08ba877aefd92a21c0cfef02c9309	-1	-1

Last up, this whole shindig stops when a stop codon hits the field - game over. And there you go kid, that's four major steps of protein synthesis for ya.	3da38c6741b7fbf45174a85698315551	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, my china, is a bit like a taxi ride from Jozi to Durban. First off, mRNA hops on out of the nucleus, that's our passenger leaving home - this is called transcription. Then it boards the ribosome 'taxi rank', or known as translation in fancy terms. The ribosome reads the RNA code - just like checking the route your driver's gonna take. The tRNA then starts to bring in amino acids, like pit stops along the way for a quick chow. Lastly, these amino acids are joined together to form a protein - you've reached Durbs, end of the ride!	d5f05c84f4e52682d4483f6bf8f18af5	-1	-1
5	Absolutely, protein synthesis is quite the journey, eh? Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, it's like the player being called off the bench in a hockey game - they've got their instructions and now it's time to get moving. Next up is translation, which is as busy as Toronto in July, where tRNA molecules decode the mRNA sequence into amino acids - that's like your local Tim Horton's translating your order into a double-double and a box of Timbits. Then comes elongation, solid as Canadian Shield, where amino acids are added one by one to the growing protein chain - it's like stacking logs for a bonfire at a cottage getaway. Lastly, there's termination: this is when the protein synthesis ends, swift as a Calgary wind, stopping when the ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA. So you see, it's quite the cross-Canada trip!	24cef5866365a04a252d3a3856ca0ca7	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the ribosome is akin to a coded message leaving the command center, heading towards the factory floor.  2. The process of Translation, where the ribosome deciphers the mRNA, is like a skilled craftsman interpreting a set of complex blueprints.  3. As tRNA brings in corresponding amino acids, it's as though workers are delivering necessary materials based on the blueprint's specifications. 4. Lastly, when these amino acids are linked together to form a protein, it mirrors the final assembly line in our factory, where individual components are being meticulously put together to create the finished product.	0e155f285e50d116eee210044d17d96e	-1	-1
5	Awricht, here's hou it gaes. First step's the mRNA skedaddlin' oot the nucleus, a bit like a message in a bottle tossed intae the sea. Then, we have translation, it's as if the ribosome's readin' the message, translatin' it intae protein language. Next up is tRNA carryin' amino acids, a bit like a delivery van bringin' packages to a construction site. Last but nae least, the ribosome links these amino acids together tae form a protein, much like buildin' a hoose brick by brick.	c8191c23345e4b13c16a0aa0a24a415f	-1	-1
5	"The journey of protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, is akin to a recipe being followed in a kitchen. Once the ""recipe"" (mRNA) has left its storage place (nucleus), it passes through a ""door"" (nuclear pore) to get to the ""kitchen"" (cytoplasm) where it meets the ""chef"" (ribosome) who reads the recipe and gathers the necessary ""ingredients"" (amino acids) by using ""helpers"" (tRNA), finally assembling them into a ""dish"" (protein), with each step meticulously guided and controlled."	85778316fe856e4079ad09d808b47899	-1	-1
5	Certainly. The opera of protein synthesis begins with mRNA, the script, leaving the nucleus, or the green room. Act One commences with transcription where the mRNA's code is read and copied like a script being adapted for stage; Act Two follows with Translation where tRNA, akin to actors, interprets the mRNA's code into amino acids, building blocks of proteins; in Act Three, these amino acids form a polypeptide chain much like an ensemble cast assembled on stage; and finally, Act Four portrays protein folding where the polypeptide chain folds into a functional 3D protein structure, comparable to how a play springs to life on stage from mere lines in a script.	fb870e0dc2c37d4813abc5dd41f92375	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to following a recipe where mRNA is the set of instructions that leaves the nucleus - the recipe book. The first stage is transcription, much like copying out the recipe - DNA in the nucleus is transcribed into mRNA. Next comes post-transcriptional modification, resembling recipe refinement for better results - introns are removed from the mRNA and a cap and tail added. This modified mRNA then exits the nucleus, similar to taking your perfected recipe to the kitchen. Finally, during translation, like cooking the dish itself, tRNA uses the mRNA sequence to assemble amino acids into a protein within the ribosome, or our metaphorical 'kitchen'.	4cf7b62f6e00aebf1bdacee4fa9039c1	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs is eggs, protein synthesis is a key job of every living cell. This starts with mRNA legging it from the nucleus just as fast as greased lightning. Then, in no time at all, it finds a ribosome to call home, where it's decoded in a process called translation - like reading an old recipe that's been in the family for donkey's years. Then, bang on cue, tRNA molecules start bringing in amino acids, each one fitting together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle to build the protein. Finally, when the protein is fully assembled and folded up neat as a new pin, it’s ready to go about its business in the cell.	0815f1a636af918dd71e8f7185676b12	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, imagine protein synthesis as a special Southern recipe passed down from your granny. First off, mRNA bein' the recipe card leaves the nucleus- the kitchen cupboard, embarks on a journey to ribosome- the cookin' pot. Next, tRNA, actin' like the ingredient fetcher, brings amino acids- them tasty elements to this ribosome. Thirdly, these amino acids are joined together in a specific order- just like mixin' your ingredients properly while bakin' a pie, led by that mRNA sequence. Finally, once our dish is prepared (that's our protein), it's folded into a unique shape, sorta like how each Southern mama has her way of foldin’ a perfect biscuit dough. That, darlin', is your protein synthesis in four steps.	30b825ac93c17758493b6b9188e03bb7	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: This is akin to a blueprint leaving the architect's office, carrying vital information for construction.  2. Translation: It's like the foreman (ribosome) reading the blueprint (mRNA) and gathering necessary materials (tRNA with amino acids). 3. Polypeptide formation: This resembles building blocks (amino acids) being assembled in the correct order according to the blueprint. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, akin to the final touches in construction wherein after assembling, everything folds into unique shapes creating a fully functional building (protein).	cead246a2163d85fe5bea174b450f328	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leave de nucleus like how boat leave harbor, carry information bout de protein we need. Two, ribosome come like builder, it read and translate mRNA message in de cytoplasm. Three, tRNA is like little truck carrying specific amino acid to the ribosome based on what the mRNA say. Four, these amino acids join together like bricks in a wall to form de protein we want.	88b23dd0bb32750046a436239a8e8497	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's consider the process of protein synthesis as a construction project. The mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the blueprint being taken from the architect's office (the nucleus) to the construction site which is the cytoplasm. The first step is mRNA translation, this is where the blueprint is read and interpreted by 'construction workers' called ribosomes. Next, we have tRNA charging where each tRNA molecule 'picks up' an amino acid - think of them as construction materials being loaded onto trucks. Thirdly, during elongation, these amino acids (materials) are brought to the ribosomes and are added one by one to a growing protein chain in the order specified by the blueprint. Lastly, termination happens when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA and the newly-built protein (building) is released for use or further modification.	dfc5191e026b78ed70c0b448d01ac6f1	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: This is like a royal messenger leaving the castle, carrying the king's orders for the kingdom. The mRNA holds valuable information from DNA in the nucleus and transports it to the cytoplasm. 2. Translation: Think of this step as a decoding process, similar to cracking a secret code. The ribosome reads and translates the mRNA's genetic information into a specific sequence of amino acids. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: Imagine this as building a pearl necklace, where each pearl is an amino acid. The ribosome connects these pearls or amino acids together, forming a long chain called a polypeptide. 4. Protein Folding: This phase could be compared to folding origami. The newly formed polypeptide folds into a unique 3D shape which is essential for its function. Just like how an origami bird won't fly if not folded properly, proteins won't function if not folded correctly.	408617c66d2a3e755202b7c523f32103	-1	-1
5	Aw-righty, here's the skinny on protein synthesis, ya know, startin' from when mRNA waves bye-bye to the nucleus. Imagine it like this: First off, mRNA's like a messenger gal rushin' outta the town square (that's your nucleus), headin' straight for the local factory (that'd be your ribosome) with blueprints (codons) for some new-fangled machinery (the protein). Next up, particles called tRNA swing by like delivery trucks, carryin' a special kinda cargo - amino acids. They match these up perfectly with them blueprints from mRNA. This process continues, just like a well-oiled assembly line, linkin' one amino acid after another 'til we got ourselves a nice long chain - that's our protein. Last but not least, that protein gets folded faster than an origami crane at a county fair. How it folds determines what job it's gonna do in our body. It's like askin' if you need a flathead or a philips-head screwdriver - depends on the job at hand.	4407061edbe98d661f0aa7a2c749f9c9	-1	-1
5	Awrite, so imagine protein synthesis is like plannin' a big night oot. First up, mRNA is like yer pal leaving the hoose (nucleus) wi' the party details (genetic info). Second, it hops on the bus (ribosome) where the plan gets translated into a kind of guest list (amino acid sequence). Thirdly, tRNA is like the bouncer, checkin' this list and bringin' in the right folks (amino acids). Lastly, these amino acids get together like a group of best mates dancin' at a ceilidh (polypeptide chain), creatin' a belter of a night (protein).	cafd0bfe34decf9c5e374925be8ae052	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a factory production line, with four key stages. First, the mRNA exits the nucleus like a manager leaving his office carrying the 'blueprint' for production, which is the genetic information. In the second step, this 'blueprint', or mRNA, attaches itself to a ribosome in the cytoplasm just like a worker heading to his work station. Thirdly, tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome akin to staff delivering parts to an assembly line; each tRNA has an anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA, ensuring the correct sequence. Finally, these amino acids are joined together in a polypeptide chain forming a protein, much like individual car parts being assembled to form a complete car.	b700c4a23d970f3b8f2b279c6f754192	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transport: This is akin to a coveted blueprint leaving the architect's office, as the mRNA, carrying coded instructions for protein synthesis, exits the nucleus of the cell and heads towards the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: Just like starting to read a book from the first page, the ribosome attaches to the start codon (AUG) on the mRNA strand, signaling the beginning of protein synthesis. 3. Elongation: Similar to a train adding more cars on its journey, amino acids are added one by one, extending the growing protein chain as per the order specified by the mRNA code. 4. Termination: Much like reaching the end of a journey or a book, when a stop codon on mRNA is reached, it signals that the newly synthesized protein chain is complete and detaches it from the ribosome.	0bee2b9d86bc7752795981f1141fed48	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit and Translation Initiation: Like a guest of honor leaving a mansion to attend a grand party, mRNA exits the nucleus carrying the coded message for protein production.  2. Codon Recognition: This resembles a game of match-the-pair where tRNA molecules identify the corresponding codons on the mRNA. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: Imagine building blocks being connected; amino acids are brought together by ribosomes, forming a long chain of peptide bonds to build the protein. 4. Termination & Protein Release: When the mRNA message ends, it's like a movie director yelling 'Cut!' The ribosome halts its work, releases the newly-formed protein and it folds into its unique shape, ready for action.	5bacf66ab69b3ed3b44b92eee03e335d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to crafting a unique recipe. The first step is transcription where the mRNA (recipe book) leaves the nucleus (archive room), then in translation the mRNA goes to the ribosome (the chef) where it is decoded into a polypeptide chain (ingredients are prepared and combined); next comes post-translational modifications which is like final seasoning, adjustments to taste and presentation of the dish; finally, protein folding occurs wherein the crafted recipe (protein) properly folds into the unique shape needed for its function, much as a soufflé rises to obtain its unique form and function when baked under precise conditions.	fe942e5b68523a4266cc4adefc8b3bd3	-1	-1
5	Ah, sure thing. So picture this: the mRNA is like our Red Sox outfielder just catchin' a fly ball - that's it leaving the nucleus. Then it heads off to the ribosome, which is kinda like Fenway Park: where the action happens. That's translation. Next up, amino acids strut up like they're clam chowder in a bread bowl, ready to be devoured - that's the tRNA bringing 'em to the mRNA. Finally, these amino acids link up quicker than a Green Line train during rush hour, forming a protein, and that’s your protein synthesis right there!	c9dc04620b38c5a270bb3c30c967929d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mate. Let's take a gander at this process as if we're making boerewors at a braai – it's not as dry as the Karoo, promise!  1) First off, mRNA is like your braai master leaving the kitchen with the recipe (nucleus), heading for the braai stand (cytoplasm). This first step is known as transcription. 2) Next, 'n ou in the form of a ribosome reads that recipe (translation), much like Oom Kobus scrutinising every detail before he starts. 3) Then the transfer RNA (tRNA), or our braai tong equivalent, fetches the needed ingredients (amino acids). But remember, like a leopard doesn't change its spots, tRNA can only bind to specific amino acids. 4) Last but not least, these ingredients are linked together on the ribosome to make our boerewors (protein chain), this is known as elongation. After a bit of time on the grill (folding and processing), you’ll have yourself some lekker protein. Just don't forget to turn the wors quick-quick!	e9a586d3761ea2b033e4adc9c9764b57	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's hit the ice here. Picture protein synthesis as a hockey game: mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a player leaving the bench. The first step is transcription in the nucleus, akin to a strategic play devised in a huddle. This 'play' is then carried out into the cytoplasm, like executing on-ice strategies. The ribosome, acting like our goalie, reads this 'play' (mRNA sequence) and brings in tRNA molecules - your star forwards - each carrying an amino acid. Lastly, these amino acids link together to form a protein, much like a string of successful passes leading to the ultimate goal - a completed protein!	ae631b1ad546a8a4450e6f0c722ff833	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis can be compared to a chef following a recipe. First, the chef (which represents m-RNA) leaves the recipe box (the nucleus), carrying the recipe (genetic information). The chef then arrives at the kitchen counter (the ribosome), where he/she starts preparing the ingredients (amino acids). These ingredients are brought by waiters (tRNA) and assembled in a specific order to make the final dish (protein). Then, the dish is served (protein released into the cytoplasm or transported out of the cell), where it's ready to perform its function.	c6f18d936691a7988d56e753ac6aa152	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae we'll kick aff wi mRNA skedaddlin' oot the nucleus, richt? First off, mRNA gets itsel' tae the ribosome, that's a bit like jumpin' ontae the bus an' findin' yer seat.  Secondly, it's time fur the 'tRNA translation', where each codon on the mRNA matches up wi' an anti-codon on the tRNA - think o' it as a guid auld Scots ceilidh, where each dancer finds their pair.  Third in line is amino acid chainin'. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid corresponding to the codon it's paired wi', and these get strung together like beads on a necklace.  Finally, we have protein foldin'. Once all the amino acids are strung together, they start tae twist an' turn intae complex shapes - a bit like how we weave our tartan patterns. And there ye hae it - that's your protein synthesis!	619cfdf347855406d6f4142afe6eaf94	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a message being sent from a command center (nucleus) to a factory floor (cytoplasm). The message (mRNA) is translated by machines (ribosomes) using raw materials (amino acids delivered by tRNAs), into a product (protein), which then undergoes quality check and modification (folding into correct shape by chaperone proteins and possible chemical modification in the Golgi apparatus) before being shipped out for use.	983cfc8c878770c5a6cc9cda67bfcd62	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a detailed recipe being retrieved from a secure vault (nucleus), then handed over to a master chef (ribosome) in a bustling kitchen (cytoplasm). The chef, using the recipe's instructions (transcription), gathers specific ingredients (amino acids) through diligent sous chefs (tRNA), and skillfully assembles them in the correct order (translation) to create a unique, functional dish (protein).	30097fbf820892eeee27ac804e7edf84	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a precise factory assembly line. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus (like a specific product blueprint), it's transported to the ribosome (the factory), where tRNA (the workers) matches amino acids (parts) to the mRNA sequence (blueprint), and these join together in a polypeptide chain (assembled product).	90b2c814990f84b9336d85101c1cdb4e	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, protein synthesis is a bit like baking a grand Irish soda bread. First up, our recipe (mRNA) leaves the cookbook holder (nucleus). Next, we're away to the races as the mRNA recipe is read by a ribosome, which is like the baker himself reading out loud what ingredients are needed. Our third step is like picking up each ingredient from the pantry - tRNA collects the right amino acids, just as one picks out flour or buttermilk. Finally, it's time to put it all together; the ribosome links these amino acids into a protein chain, similar to how our baker would be kneading together all components to form our lovely loaf of bread.	291f977adeff070f6dfa2090de49ae71	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for asking such a 'nifty question! Alrighty then, let's get the ball rollin'.  1. mRNA Exit: Like a debutante at her cotillion, mRNA waltzes right out of the nucleus ready to kick up a ruckus.  2. Ribosome Parking Spot: The mRNA finds its place in the ribosome like a trucker pulling into a rest stop after a long haul. 3. tRNA Hustle: Now, here's where it gets busy as a one-armed paper hanger. The tRNA starts transporting amino acids to the mRNA, each with their own special codon match - they're like two peas in a pod. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Last but not least, these amino acids hold hands and form a polypeptide chain, sorta like folks do-si-doing at a square dance. And presto! You've got yourself some protein synthesis.	bfbef72d9cd7e6f7a2b6eb21699f9292	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a royal messenger carrying the king's decree, mRNA leaves the nucleus conveying genetic messages. 2. Ribosome Reading: With mRNA as its guide, the ribosome, acting like a skilled craftsman, carefully reads these messages. 3. tRNA Matching: tRNA is akin to a key, each perfectly matching its corresponding amino acid lock on the mRNA strand. 4. Protein Formation: It's like building a Lego tower, the ribosome links the amino acids together based on the instructions, forming a unique protein structure.	285360270dd4beff0f0879cdea1895ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a relay race. First, mRNA exits the nucleus like a baton being passed to the first runner, this is the Transcription phase. Next, mRNA goes to ribosome like the runner racing along the track, this is called Translation. Thirdly, tRNA reads mRNA's message like a coach inspecting the race from the sidelines, this is the Decoding process. Lastly, amino acids join and fold into a protein like a team of runners celebrating their win by joining hands in unity, this marked as Protein Folding.	e42c32fccafa65262da530fcba13cda3	-1	-1
5	The grand journey begins as our hero, mRNA, bids farewell to its birthplace - the nucleus. It's mission - to rendezvous with the Ribosome, the city of protein production. Here, like a choreographer instructing dancers on stage, mRNA delivers the code for amino acid sequence via tRNA, an interpreter transforming language into motion. Each tRNA, a diligent craftsman, binds specific amino acids to build a polypeptide chain, akin to bricks building a wall. This chain then undergoes final transformation - it folds and twists into a unique shape, just like a paper origami taking its final form - the completed protein. The protein is now ready to embark on its own adventure within the body.	afd805553188f23e37ae3ed3a62e47dc	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to a blueprint leaving an architect's office, carrying instructions for construction.  2. The ribosome reading the mRNA is like a builder interpreting the blueprint, understanding where and how to build. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) collecting amino acids is comparable to a worker gathering the bricks needed for building.  4. tRNA adding gathered amino acids to the protein chain is like the worker laying these bricks according to the builder's interpretation of the blueprint, constructing the final structure - our protein.	61f280632d5055f9ccabd1dcba8fabab	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, so first things first, mRNA is like the postman of the cell, delivering the message from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome. Next step's like when a construction crew reads blueprints, that's the ribosome reading the mRNA sequence. Thirdly, you got your tRNA which works like a delivery truck, bringin' amino acids over to the ribosome. Last but not least, those amino acids get pieced together like a bunch of Lego blocks, makin' a protein.	c93c66ca7b9f3eab3882c80894dfe7e0	-1	-1
5	Right, let's journey through protein synthesis like we're on a wild hike through the Highlands. Our adventure kicks off with mRNA scarpering from the nucleus like a wee scamp running from school, carrying information vital for the protein production - that's transcription for ye. Next, like a postie making their rounds in an Edinburgh tenement, mRNA delivers this info to ribosomes in a process called translation, where the message is read and understood. Just as haggis is made from various ingredients, the ribosome then stitches together amino acids to form a new protein, dependin' on the order given by mRNA. Finally, just as a master distiller checks every bottle of whisky for perfection, the newly formed protein goes through a process of folding and processing - ensuring every wee bit is in its proper place for it to function right. There's your protein synthesis, explained Scottish style!	670eafbd8b50629fc6a87e25337ede2e	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA, acting much like a secret agent, decodes the DNA's instructions within the nucleus and sets off on its mission to the cytoplasm. Secondly, it meets the ribosome, which functions as a crafting table, reading the mRNA's coded message. The third step is the tRNA’s role, acting as special delivery trucks carrying the necessary amino acids to the ribosome. Finally, like a meticulous craftsman, the ribosome links these amino acids together to create a protein; this is the magical process of translation.	0af3a418ae12cec85310389a350fe1ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a magnificent dance of molecular interactions, starting with mRNA, the script of the play, leaving its home in the nucleus. The first act is transcription where the DNA's code is copied into mRNA; second act is mRNA processing, comparable to proofreading and editing the script; third act is translation, where ribosomes, the actors, read and interpret the mRNA script into a protein; and finally, post-translational modifications, like costume changes, add the final touches to fully prepare the protein for its role.	9ebb23a1a890d97eb5e108d90664b7ff	-1	-1
5	Think of protein synthesis as a grand theatrical production. Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to the script being finalized and delivered to the actors, in this case, the ribosomes. The next act is Transcription where this script is read and an opposite copy is created, like a mirror image. Then we have Translation which can be compared to the actors rehearsing their lines, translating them into motions and emotions. The final act is the folding of proteins, much like the final dress rehearsal where everything comes together to form the final masterpiece - a functional protein.	0d4c86040ea2c315842014ed02b28db3	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the herald, mRNA, making its grand exit from the nucleus, the palace of control, we embark on a thrilling journey to protein synthesis. It's a four-step theatrical spectacle: Firstly, with the script in hand (mRNA), our main character (ribosome) settles on the stage of cytoplasm; secondly, tRNA's make their entrance, each carrying an amino acid, akin to actors bearing props; thirdly, a dazzling performance unfolds as these tRNAs pair their anticodons with mRNA’s codons, much like dancers synchronising their steps to the rhythm of music; finally, the amino acids bond together to form a protein - the grand finale of this biochemical ballet.	2d78ea6eb9cc528a6e9f09d257fc8f29	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's how it works: mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the Sox leavin' Fenway for an away game. Transcription happens first - that's like packin' up the bus with everything you need. Then comes RNA processing where introns are removed just like weeding out any unnecessary equipment. Once the mRNA is all set, translation kicks in and it's off to the big leagues - that's when all the amino acids line up at the plate, ready to form a protein, stronger than a Southie dockworker! Lastly, post-translational modifications happen; it's like addin' a bit of polish to a pitch before you throw it, ensurin' that protein functions exactly as it should.	aa41aa7bb9832170a85ae01b617dc459	-1	-1
5	Alright chommie, let's kick off this jol like a veld fire. First up, our mRNA exits the nucleus like a taxi leaving Park Station - it's got all the instructions for the protein synthesis party. Next station is the cytoplasm, where things really start to heat up quicker than boerewors on a braai - ribosomes attach to the mRNA, ready to decode its instructions. Then we have the tRNA, playing the role of the taxi gaartjie, they fetch the right amino acids and bring them over to the ribosomes. Lastly, these amino acids are strung together like a bunch of mielies on a skewer, forming a long chain that folds up on itself to become a protein, as snug and structured as a Jozi skyscraper!	465edf3c1aa1b89f8a6b0fde25e84ff2	-1	-1
5	Alright, so let's kick this off just like a hockey game in the heart of winter. Imagine mRNA as that eager young player leaving the locker room, aka nucleus, ready for the game. 1) First, it hits the ice rink, which is our cytoplasm, joining up with its line mate, the ribosome. This is where the translation process starts, as heavy as a moose and as determined as a beaver building its dam.  2) Then comes the second step, which is reading the mRNA codon. It's like an experienced coach deciphering a secret play strategy with three-letter sequences, or codons, instructions for which specific amino acid to add next. 3) In our third play, tRNA, acting as quick-footed as a mountie chasing down a suspect, brings the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, much like a defenseman bringing the puck back to his goalie. 4) Finally, we have peptide bond formation. This is similar to teammates connecting seamlessly on the ice; each amino acid links together to form a long chain - the protein - as solid as the Canadian Shield. And there you have it, protein synthesis in all its glory!	3b890dda0a863a7aec133b57b1e72628	-1	-1
5	Envision the protein synthesis process as a grand theatrical production, where our mRNA is the star performer departing from its dressing room, the nucleus. Firstly, it takes the center stage in the cytoplasm, specifically at the ribosome, where it guides the assembly of amino acids like a script directing actors - this is called translation. Secondly, tRNA, akin to supporting actors, arrive bearing amino acids and pair up with codons on mRNA to form a polypeptide chain. Thirdly, this chain then folds into a unique shape to become a functional protein, much like how a play unfolds scene by scene to narrate a story. Finally, the finished protein leaves the ribosome to perform its role in the body; just as an actor leaves the stage after delivering their performance. Each step is crucial in this dramatic spectacle of life - all directed by the genetic code.	e8c9674dff33eb46ace609ddd2d7f56a	-1	-1
5	Aright, let's think o' protein synthesis like a puir loon tryin' tae build his ain hoose. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus, sorta like the blueprint for the house bein' passed on, then it goes tae the ribosome which is like a workman readin' these blueprints. Next, tRNA brings in the amino acids, just as if our workman gathered his bricks an' cement, an' finally these amino acids are joined together in a long chain tae form a protein - akin to our lad meticulously placin' each brick tae build his solid wall.	3204473d9e32ab8ab35631d60564d4fd	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus can be compared to a coded message leaving a command center, holding vital instructions for the troops still on the field. 2. The voyage of mRNA to ribosomes in the cytoplasm mirrors an explorer embarking on a quest, carrying a map (mRNA) to a treasure (protein) that needs to be found. 3. In a process akin to translating cryptic poetry into plain language, tRNA decodes mRNA's message during translation, converting nucleotide language into amino acid language. 4. Like a master craftsman assembling pieces of puzzle, the ribosome uses this translated information to construct proteins, an action that culminates protein synthesis.	418636311d6eb91333404631c4aa3d3b	-1	-1
5	Like a crucial letter emerging from the control center of a vast city, mRNA exits the nucleus carrying the blueprint for protein synthesis. The process unfolds in four pivotal acts: first, mRNA's grand departure into the rough endoplasmic reticulum stage where it acts like a script, guiding ribosomes—the protein factories; second, tRNA, much like actors interpreting the script, brings appropriate amino acids to the developing protein chain; third, peptide bonds form between adjacent amino acids, creating a beautiful dance akin to choreographed ballet; and finally, like the curtain call signaling the end of a performance, the completed protein detaches and is folded into its functional shape by chaperone proteins.	9b54d699ccfd4d6da3ffd442816ecd58	-1	-1
5	Consider the process of protein synthesis as a grand theatrical production. The mRNA, acting like the script, exits the nucleus - the writer's room - and embarks on its journey to the ribosomes - the stage - where it is read by the tRNA - our skilled actors. As these actors interpret their lines in a process called translation, they assemble amino acids - props and costumes - into a specific order to create proteins, that constitute the final breathtaking performance.	60a2de5081976faca2ba4e595a48ab30	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like knitting a sweater, with mRNA as the blueprint. First, like getting the yarn out of the cupboard, mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves into cytoplasm, then it meets up with the ribosome, acting as the knitting needles. The tRNA, or the hands doing the knitting, brings in amino acids which match with codons on mRNA just like matching wool colours to the pattern. At last, this process continues until a 'stop' codon is reached - akin to finishing your last stitch - producing a completed protein, as perfect as a new hand-knit Aran jumper!	4508737a084c31ae892be19bc83fc9e3	-1	-1
5	Well now ain't this a hoot? I reckon protein synthesis is kinda like a Southern cook-off with four main steps. First off, mRNA, the recipe from the nucleus kitchen, heads on out to the ribosome grill. This here's called transcription. Next up, that mRNA recipe gets read in a process we call translation, much like how Aunt Sally reads her biscuit recipe. Now the tRNA, or transfer RNA if yer fancy, brings in amino acids - think of 'em like the ingredients for our cook-off dish. Lastly, these amino acids get strung together into a protein, just like how we string together our ingredients into a mouth-watering Southern dish.	53a41cabea2884b0c141a426eef0b352	-1	-1
5	1. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus like an important letter being sent out.  2. Next, it arrives at the ribosome (the factory) where tRNA (workers) use its instructions to assemble amino acids (building blocks) in a specific order. 3. This process called translation is akin to constructing a building based on a blueprint. 4. Lastly, these amino acid chains fold into complex structures, just as origami transforms a flat paper into a 3D model, thus forming proteins that have various functions within the body.	83e9f4cfcdbff70bdc6365523ad2b307	-1	-1
5	Alright, think of it like this. The mRNA coming out of nucleus is like a message in a bottle leaving its island, first it travels to the ribosome - our messenger's destination, where it gets unrolled (translation process) and read. Using this message, the ribosome with the help of tRNA (like helpful sailor), starts to assemble amino acids (building blocks) in the order specified by the message to form a protein - a grand ship being built. Lastly, when protein is fully formed (ship is built), it folds into its unique shape (ship sets sail) and goes on its mission in the cell.	e61c4ab68b336d60bab751abf2fefc08	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a factory assembly line. Starting with mRNA as the blueprint, it leaves the nucleus (the manager's office), heads towards the ribosomes (workstations) where translation (assembly) occurs by matching codons to anticodons of tRNA (workers), which brings the corresponding amino acids (parts). These amino acids join together in a polypeptide chain (final product), creating a protein, completing the process.	4c0c5ec6b6f5852c8495ba71941f7751	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transport: Like a royal message leaving the castle, the mRNA exits the nucleus carrying the genetic information. 2. Ribosome Interaction: Consider the ribosome as a factory where mRNA works as the blueprint for building proteins.  3. tRNA Matching: This is like a lock and key, where tRNA molecules with matching anti-codon pairs with mRNA's codon, bringing along specific amino acids. 4. Polypeptide Chain Formation: It's like assembling a train where each car (amino acid) joins according to the order given by the mRNA until a full protein is made.	4bfce60c198e844af4c6c7c8098a9b1a	-1	-1
5	Aw'righty then, here we go. First off, ya got transcription, which is kinda like a secretary takin' notes from the boss - mRNA is made using DNA as a template. Then ya got RNA splicin', which is sorta like prunin' a bush - introns are cut out and exons are spliced together. Next is translation, where tRNA reads the mRNA much like readin' a recipe. Finally, there's protein foldin', where it's like foldin' up a quilt - the protein takes its final form for function. So there ya have it, from start to finish, in our own heartland speak.	4961941f096c54cd9935796f5b9f2aed	-1	-1
5	Right, let me take a stab at this. Imagine mRNA as a chatty wee postie, leavin' the nucleus - or 'post office' if ye like. First, it scoots to the ribosome - think of this as the local pub where everyone gets together for a good yarn. This is where our pal mRNA is translated into amino acids, or as I like to call 'em, the regulars at the pub. They're strung together in a specific order to make a protein - much like tales spun on a night out. Then we've got fancy term like 'post-translational modification', which is like giving our newly formed protein a bit of a makeover before it's ready to step out into the cell and do its job. It's all a fine dance, just like a ceilidh on a Saturday night!	ca47cb8a64321c46cd4c30ed876a89d8	-1	-1
5	1. The first step, akin to a royal decree leaving the palace, is mRNA's departure from the nucleus carrying the genetic information required for protein synthesis.  2. The next stage is like a journey across turbulent seas, as the mRNA travels through the cytoplasm eventually docking at the ribosome, a bustling protein factory. 3. Here it's analogous to an intricate dance between tRNA and mRNA, with tRNA bringing amino acids and matching them with the codons on the mRNA in a process known as translation. 4. Lastly, like building blocks being meticulously assembled, these amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain which ultimately folds into a functional protein, revealing the extraordinary precision of our cellular machinery.	8a7ab5ff8376581a5aec589a8e0bd8eb	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA export: This is akin to a commuter leaving their home, with mRNA exiting the nucleus carrying blueprints (genetic information) for protein creation. 2. Initiation of translation: The ribosome comes into play here, functioning like a factory assembling line, where it attaches to the mRNA and starts reading its blueprint. 3. Elongation: As the process continues, tRNA - acting as delivery trucks - brings in specific amino acids to the ribosome which adds them to the growing protein chain. 4. Termination: This phase is comparable to clocking off at the end of a workday when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	8e5f6219e213eac880b3bb1781bf69ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with a process akin to an encrypted message being sent from the nucleus, this is called mRNA transcription. The message, or mRNA, then travels to the ribosome which acts like a decoder ring, translating the message in a step known as translation. Here, tRNA molecules deliver specific amino acids - somewhat like keys - based on the coded message. These keys are fitted together in an exact order to create a specific protein, much like individual pieces of Lego coming together as per instructions to form a complete structure.	6ea10d5d6d94a507a148b2e7ce2e35bb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a detailed factory production line. Firstly, the mRNA, acting as the detailed blueprint, leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes, the factory floor. Secondly, in a process known as translation, tRNA molecules - the workers of the factory - interpret the mRNA code and assemble amino acids in the correct order. Thirdly, these amino acids are chained together to form proteins, much like individual components being assembled into a finished product. Lastly, these proteins are folded into their functional three-dimensional structure, comparable to quality check and final packaging in a factory before they are ready for use or delivery elsewhere in the cell.	b22856665d56dcc61237dd1f6b7e7407	-1	-1
5	Alright, so ya got the mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus like a Sox fan dodgin' Yankees supporters, right? That's step one. Then it's onto the ribosome, which is busy as Faneuil Hall at Christmas, where it gets read like a map to Fenway Park in step two - that’s yer translation. Now, we're onto step three, which is sharper than a Sox fan's wit: each codon on the mRNA matches up with an anticodon, just like pairs of wicked loyal Pats fans. Last but not least, you've got step four – our lil' friend mRNA is like a blueprint for a protein and as soon as all the amino acids are strung together tighter than traffic on Storrow Drive, you’ve got yourself the final product - a brand new protein.	16b991ff12b0655db223e9f7beec94ef	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes: Protein synthesis is a bit like planning and hosting a truly South African braai. The mRNA, much like the invitation, leaves the nucleus (the house) and finds the ribosome (the braai stand), which reads the invitation or 'code' to assemble the right amino acids (guests). This process is called translation, similar to translating the message of the party invite. These amino acids then link together in a chain (much like boerewors on a skewer) through a process called elongation, eventually forming a protein (the perfect braai feast). Eish, but don't forget about that last step, termination – it's when the ribosome hits a stop code and releases the protein, much like when everyone's had their fill and it's time to call it a night!	04739d5decfc1703f0bbc807d28df12d	-1	-1
5	Alright, so starting off with mRNA leaving the nucleus is kind of like your buddy in Ottawa finally getting off his chesterfield and starting his road trip out west. The first major step after that, would be the mRNA translation, which is akin to him reading a map in order to figure out his route - this is done by ribosomes that decode the information in the mRNA. The second step, tRNA anti-codon pairing, is like our friend meeting familiar faces at each pit stop who help him refuel and gather supplies - here, the tRNA brings in the amino acids. Next up, peptide bond formation is like our buddy linking up with other travellers along his journey, bonding over shared experiences - this process links together amino acids into a chain. Lastly, there's protein folding where the chain folds into a specific shape to become a functioning protein - it's like him pitching a tent at the end of each day; if it's not done right, he won't have shelter and it’s as useless as a chocolate teapot.	f27dbfae6f8ffed40c65c1d7132cb7bb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a meticulous dance of molecular interactions, starting with the mRNA, the blueprint of the dance, leaving the nucleus. The first step is transcription where inside the nucleus, DNA's information is converted into mRNA like translating a difficult choreography into simpler steps. This mRNA then leaves the nucleus in a process known as RNA processing, akin to the dancer stepping onto the stage. The next phase, translation, occurs in the ribosomes, where the mRNA code is 'read' and used to assemble amino acids into a protein chain, much like how a dancer follows the choreography to perform movements. Lastly, post-translational modifications carry out final adjustments to the protein structure akin to the dancer perfecting their moves before the final performance.	fc248205e98b52d1424da00b83f19eaf	-1	-1
5	Weel, laddie, protein synthesis is a braw process that's a lot like bakin' a loaf o' breid. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus, much like ye'd take yer recipe oot of its safe keepin'. Next, it heads intae the cytoplasm, sorta like takin' yer ingredients tae the kitchen. Nae soon after, the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence, just as ye would scan through the recipe steps. Lastly, tRNA brings in the proper amino acids alignin' them akin tae how ye'd gather all yer ingredients afore ye begin mixin'. So there ye hae it - from recipe to hot, fresh loaf, that's how protein synthesis works!	d27225278ad9f308e3b6e861cf7ec8cb	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a complex culinary recipe. Firstly, mRNA, the ""recipe book,"" is transported from the nucleus - or the ""library"" - to ribosomes, which serve as the ""chefs"" in the cytoplasm; here, the process of translation begins. Next, transfer RNA (tRNA), or the ""ingredients,"" binds to specific amino acids and brings them to the ribosome that matches the codon on the mRNA (the steps in the recipe). The ribosome then links these amino acids together, creating a polypeptide chain - our ""dish."" Finally, this ""meal"" is then folded into a 3D structure to create a protein. This entire process is akin to a chef reading a recipe, gathering ingredients, preparing a dish, and then presenting it in an appealing way."	7335d8af714c997cc054597bf5521211	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, akin to an intricate dance of biomolecules, initiates when mRNA, like a coded message, departs the nucleus and ventures into the cytoplasm. This initial step sets in motion four key stages: first, mRNA attaches to a ribosome, much like a blueprint finding its architect; second, tRNA molecules, acting as couriers, transport specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA's codons; third, each amino acid is meticulously joined together in a process that mirrors chain assembly; and fourth, the finale sees the completed protein folding itself into a precise shape - a sculptor carefully molding their creation - essential for its specific function.	9a079b3182514e92ccdb0f769d963e2e	-1	-1
5	Envision protein synthesis as a theatrical production where mRNA plays the lead role. First, in the nucleus (the 'scriptwriting room'), mRNA is meticulously crafted from DNA (the 'director') and then it exits, bearing vital genetic information (the script). The second act takes place in the cytoplasm, specifically on the ribosomes ('stage'), where translation happens; this is akin to actors interpreting scripts into performances. Next, tRNA (the 'supporting actors') reads these codons, each responsible for a specific amino acid ('props and costumes'), assembling them into a polypeptide chain (a scene). Lastly, these chains fold into complex 3D shapes ('final performance'), creating the proteins that perform countless essential functions in our bodies - thus completing the show of life at a microscopic level.	74977e021c590f98f88c0d58bc019cb7	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Protein synthesis, it's a bit like organising a grand ceilidh. Starting off, the mRNA is like the invitation going arseways out of the nucleus, that's your house. Transcription is next, like writing out those invites as fast as greased lightning, converting DNA into mRNA. The invitations are then tweaked and refined during RNA processing, making sure all the details are quare before they're sent out. Finally, there's translation where the mRNA is read to assemble the proteins, just like how our party guests would interpret the instructions on their invites.	e2abeed0383c8dc8469a8f1868cd194a	-1	-1
5	Well, now, let's get started on this 'un. First off, you got that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, kinda like a hound dog breakin' loose from his pen. Then that little rascal goes on to the ribosome, or what I like to call the protein factory. Next up, tRNA comes in carryin' amino acids, like a ole mule with a heavy load. Then these tRNA fellas start pairin' up with the mRNA codons - they go together like biscuits and gravy. Last stop on the line is when them amino acids get linked into a polypeptide chain, makin' our new protein, just as a blacksmith would forge a new horseshoe.	5ee83c624fb96fe8f476badbe97ba75b	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is a bit like constructing a building. First, the ""blueprint"" (mRNA) exits the control center (nucleus) and goes to the construction site (ribosome). Second, the translation begins where the workers (tRNA molecules) read the blueprint and bring in the correct building blocks (amino acids). Third, these building blocks are assembled together in a chain to create the structure (protein), like bricks in a wall. Finally, after completion, the protein is transported to its destination in the cell, similar to a finished building being opened for use."	99324ceece59d83f84f0a6aeaf7e75df	-1	-1

Ribosome Binding: The mRNA then binds to the ribosome (the protein factory), where it will serve as a template for protein synthesis. 3. Translation: The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and matches it with corresponding amino acids (like matching letters to form words). This process is called translation.  4. Protein Folding: Once the complete sequence of amino acids (the word) is assembled, it folds into a specific structure that determines its function - much like how a folded paper can become an airplane or a boat, depending on its structure.	e996c8014ab83c8bc6a2ad44708f3b92	-1	-1
5	1. First, mRNA (messager RNA) leaves the nucleus like an important letter from the king's palace. This step is called transcription. 2. Second, mRNA goes to the ribosome in cytoplasm, likened to a factory where workers wait for instructions. 3. Third, tRNA (transfer RNA) brings specific amino acids to the ribosome interpreting the 'letter' (mRNA), like a postman delivering parcels exactly as ordered. 4. Finally, these amino acids form a chain following mRNA instructions which becomes the protein, like building blocks forming a castle based on a blueprint.	032af64a2b4325487d0817437393d52a	-1	-1
5	Well, this here process is like a well-oiled assembly line in an auto plant. mRNA peels outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date, carrying coded instructions for protein makin'. Then it hitches a ride with a ribosome, which reads the mRNA like a recipe book and starts gatherin' up amino acids. These amino acids are finer than frog hair split three ways, and they're strung together by transfer RNA in the order that mRNA's got laid out. That there growing string of amino acids folds itself into a unique shape and bam! You got yourself a brand-new protein.	bb769cf8f3c47b7fefa79a89695fc49b	-1	-1

Translation Initiation: This is when the assembly line starts up, where ribosomes bind to the mRNA. 3. Elongation: This can be likened to the manufacturing process on the assembly line, as the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and assembles the corresponding amino acids in order. 4. Termination: This is like the end of the production line; when a stop codon is reached in the mRNA sequence, translation ends and the new protein is released for further processing or use within the cell.	894981275056f2b15251a23a691cdd4d	-1	-1

Transcription (Recipe Copy): mRNA (the recipe copy) is created in the nucleus, essentially copying the DNA (original recipe). 2. mRNA Processing (Recipe Check): The mRNA is processed; introns (irrelevant instructions) are removed and exons (essential instructions) are spliced together, akin to proofreading and adjusting the recipe. 3. Translation (Cooking): This is where the ribosome reads the mRNA (follows the recipe) and tRNA brings appropriate amino acids (ingredients), creating a chain that folds into a protein (the final dish). 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modification (Plating and Garnishing): The newly formed protein will fold into its functional shape and may undergo further modifications, like adding garnish to a dish to make it complete.	abf45ef8dcb4641cc8c5131c93fd6fea	-1	-1

Next step is it gets onto a ribosome and this is where translation starts, sort of like when you switch on Google translate - turning genetic language into protein language. Then we have tRNA coming in slow as a wet week, carrying amino acids to the ribosome and matching them with the mRNA. Lastly, these amino acids link up to form a protein chain, spreading out faster than a veld fire. Each step is critical in creating these proteins that are the building blocks for life bru.	941b38442288d2d58bfab33484cbd58c	-1	-1

5	Sure and begorrah, protein synthesis is like a well-rehearsed play, starting with our star, mRNA exiting that nucleus stage left. First off, it's off to the ribosomes where it's read like a book at a Sunday service; this is called translation - giving us a fancy string of amino acids. Then we're as solid as the Rock of Cashel with our peptide bonds forming between these amino acids in a process called elongation - creating the protein chain. The grand finale sees the process halt when a stop codon is reached and this new protein, wet as an otter's pocket, is released to go about its business. Lastly, there's protein folding where the chain folds up on itself like you would on the never never after a night at the pub - making sure those proteins are functional and fit for purpose.	81a280da8ba594f348d33ae2e238503a	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for asking such a question! Now, picture this: protein synthesis is kind of like Mama's recipe for her famous apple pie.  1) First off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus like a hound dog on a hot tin roof, carrying the recipe for the protein. This here step is called transcription.      2) Next up, it hightails it to the ribosome in the cytoplasm—kind of like heading over to Mama's kitchen. 3) Then, just as Mama'd use her recipe as a guide for baking pie, the ribosome uses mRNA as its guide in a process called translation, making sure everything's done just right.  4) Now, it wouldn't be much of a pie without filling and crust. In our case, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings in amino acids—kind of like fetching apples from the pantry—which are then pieced together to form the protein. Like when Mama bakes her pie, every ingredient has to be added in the right order for it to taste just right. That there's what we call polypeptide chain elongation. And there you have it, sugar! Four major steps of protein synthesis done and dusted, explained Southern style.	b9e8a4b2a93818041e8b4083949e4d37	-1	-1
5	"1. mRNA Transport: Just like a blueprint being delivered from an architect's office, the mRNA, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Attachment: Similar to a factory assembling a product, the ribosome attaches to the mRNA and prepares for protein synthesis. 3. Translation: Like translating a foreign language into one's native tongue, the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and translates it into amino acids, the ""words"" of proteins. 4. Protein Folding: Mimicking origami artistry, the chain of amino acids folds onto itself to form a specific shape, which determines the protein's function in the body."	1cddd1f6c41cfe519b0519ed231c7a58	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving Nucleus: This be like the town crier spreading the king's message, so to. The mRNA (the messenger) leaves the nucleus with the genetic instructions from the DNA (the king's message). 2. Translation: Now we at the translation phase, it be like when you got to read a map. The ribosome (map reader) reads this mRNA message (the map), to figure out which amino acids (destinations) it need to fetch. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: Think of this as them building a bridge plank by plank. Each new amino acid is added to the chain through peptide bond (the planks), making what we call a polypeptide chain (the bridge). 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, we have protein folding. You can liken this to folding a piece of cloth into a specific design or shape. The polypeptide chain folds in specific ways to form a functional protein, just like how the cloth becomes something useful when it's folded right.	10825f4d81d1bce30d9d777a4ad3626b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a royal decree leaving the castle, the mRNA, carrying the genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus, embarks on its journey to the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosomes act like skilled artisans reading blueprints, interpreting the codons on the mRNA sequence into amino acids. 3. tRNA Matching: This is akin to a locksmith matching keys, where each tRNA molecule, equipped with an amino acid, finds and attaches to its corresponding codon on the mRNA. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Finally, like building blocks being meticulously assembled, these amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide chain, which folds into a functional protein.	de19e3c4d7b48e113bfb9a8814431602	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a courier carrying critical information, the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic instructions for protein synthesis. 2. Translation Initiation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes attach to the mRNA like a decoder ring, signaling the start of protein synthesis. 3. Elongation Phase: This process is akin to chaining together links as each amino acid is added in sequence according to instructions on the mRNA. 4. Termination and Release: The final step resembles a factory assembly line shutting down when a stop signal is reached on the mRNA, causing the completed protein to be released.	94cb192ed850f5b6faa88b1d6a55dbe0	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing. Alright, so first off, think of that mRNA as a hot-off-the-press newspaper leaving the printing press, or in this case, the nucleus. Then it's gonna hook up with this little machine called a ribosome, which is kinda like a factory assembly line. It'll read that mRNA, or ""newspaper"", line by line to build a chain of amino acids, sorta like piecing together a car on the line. That there chain will then fold faster than a jackrabbit on a date into a 3D protein. And lastly, if any mistakes are made - which is like trying to put lipstick on a pig - it's got to be fixed or destroyed so it doesn't cause problems."	17342be5bcabe63451669e3a18b2fa53	-1	-1
5	"First off, mRNA's journey oot the nucleus is kin to a braw lad leavin' his mammy's hoose, bracin' for a big adventure. Second, there's the ""Translation"" stage at ribosomes, think of it as if a secretive Scotsman is translating coded messages intae plain Scots for all to understand. Then comes along ""Elongation"", like layin' bricks down one after the other to build a long wall, amino acids are linked in a chain tae form a polypeptide. Finally, we've got ""Termination""; akin to the grand finale of Hogmanay celebrations, this stage signals the end and releases the newly formed protein."	3fd63ba6439727cdadbf14b0986d6c24	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a factory production line. First, mRNA, carrying the 'blueprint' from the DNA in the nucleus, travels to the ribosomes (the 'workshop'). Secondly, tRNA (the 'delivery trucks') arrive with specific amino acids. Thirdly, the ribosome reads the mRNA blueprint and binds the amino acids together in a specific order to form a polypeptide chain (the 'product'). Fourthly, once complete, the polypeptide chain detaches and folds into a 3D protein structure ('packaging'), ready for use within the cell.	31cde87c95e0254b4029c2ea446a76ee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, once the mRNA has left the nucleus, is like building a house following a blueprint. The major steps include:  1) mRNA Transport - This is like the blueprint for the house being delivered to the construction site, as mRNA carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosomes.   2) Translation Initiation - This step is akin to gathering all necessary workers and resources, as the ribosome attaches to the mRNA and readies itself to start making proteins. 3) Elongation - This resembles the process of actually building the house, brick by brick or in this case, amino acid by amino acid, while following instructions from the mRNA. 4) Termination - Just as a house construction ends when everything is in place and there's no more blueprint left to follow, protein synthesis concludes when a stop codon on the mRNA is reached, signaling that protein is complete.	35ff9ce33a33410114e1e870a27e4915	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a chef following a recipe to create a dish. The process entails four primary steps: 1. mRNA Export: Like a sous-chef delivering the recipe from the head chef's office (nucleus) to the kitchen (cytoplasm), mRNA carries the genetic instructions from the DNA in the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell. 2. Translation Initiation: The ribosome, acting as our chef, reads the 'recipe' on the mRNA molecule and gets ready to make the 'dish' or protein. 3. Elongation: Like adding ingredients one by one to a cooking pot, amino acids are added one by one to the growing polypeptide chain according to the sequence prescribed by the mRNA 'recipe'. 4. Termination: Just as cooking ends when the dish is ready, the protein synthesis concludes when a stop codon in the mRNA is reached, signaling that the protein is complete.	24d8f54153e9adc019919a08b0342b24	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, commencing with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, could be likened to a factory production line. It begins with ""blueprints"" (the mRNA) being dispatched from the central office (nucleus), followed by a journey down the assembly line (translation at the ribosome) where the blueprint is read and components (amino acids) are assembled into the final product (protein) by workers (tRNA and ribosomes). The finished product then undergoes quality control and finishing touches (protein folding and modification in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus)."	261b7ebf8baa7b8a72782b8ffc98c698	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first things first, ya got the mRNA exitin' the nucleus, right? It's like a Sox player runnin' for home base. Next up is that translation initiation, where everything gets set up - think of it like gettin' your gear on before the big game. Then we've got elongation, which is just a fancy way of sayin' everything gets extended out - kinda like how a good pitcher can stretch out the game. Finally, we cap it off with termination; this is when the whole shebang ends - much like finally hittin' that last out in the 9th inning. That's the whole process, from start to finish - just like a ball game down at Fenway!	f7b4347bc10d723d0ef2bcb46cea57bf	-1	-1
5	"Sure, no problem buddy!  1. Transcription: This is like a town crier, shouting out the messages from the DNA in the nucleus. The mRNA takes this ""gossip"" from the DNA and leaves the nucleus, heading into the cytoplasm. 2. Translation: When the mRNA reaches the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, it's like handing over a recipe to a chef. The ribosomes read this recipe and start pulling together all the necessary ingredients, which are amino acids in this case. 3. Elongation: This is as if you're braaing boerewors, you keep adding more to the grill until it's long enough. The same way, the protein chain grows longer as more amino acids are added. 4. Termination: This is akin to finishing off that lekker braai - you've cooked your wors just right and now it's time to take it off the fire. Similarly, once the protein is complete, synthesis stops and we have our final product! All these steps function together like a well-oiled machine or when a rugby team works together in harmony to score a try!"	324121e5ef081d70cfc2158c40ac8251	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a seasoned trapper heading out from his cabin, armed with instructions. First, this trapper, mRNA, heads into the wilderness of the cytoplasm where it meets a ribosome, the workstation like a trusty old campfire. Then, our trapper reads the coded message, the genetic code, to gather amino acids in the precise order with the help of tRNA, like a well-trained sled dog fetching firewood. Finally, these amino acids are joined together to form a protein as if they were logs stacked and bound together to build a strong log cabin. This whole process is as intricate and vital for cell function as trapping is for survival in the wild Canadian woods.	cb78aa6e53eb94c87d4a117e160db198	-1	-1
5	1) mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is akin to a coded message leaving the control center, carrying the blueprint needed for protein synthesis.  2) The process of Translation, where the ribosome reads the mRNA like an instruction manual and links together amino acids in the order specified, can be compared to construction workers building a skyscraper following exact blueprints. 3) The tRNA acts as a delivery truck, constantly bringing in the correct amino acids required at each step of assembly line.  4) Finally, once the protein is synthesized and folded into its unique shape - much like an origami masterpiece - it is then dispatched to perform its specific task within or outside the cell, like a specialized employee ready for duty.	a3756c6301b67e0ad596dcbcb778b54e	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae we're stairtin wi mRNA leggin it oot the nucleus. The hale process o protein synthesis is a braw dance in fower main steps. First, ye'v got transcription inside the nucleus where the DNA's coded message is written doon intae mRNA, kind of like scrievin a shopping list fae a cookbook recipe. Next up, this mRNA scoots aff oot the nucleus and into the cytoplasm - it’s like a postie deliverin a letter. Then there's translation, where the ribosome reads this mRNA message and starts tae stitch thegither amino acids intae a protein chain, like a knitter followin a pattern. Finally, these new proteins need tae be folded up intae the right shape so they can dae their job right – kind of like foldin up a map after ye'v used it.	58c07e4694edc04046704cc7a691900b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a well-choreographed play. The mRNA (the script) leaves the nucleus (backstage) and heads to the ribosome (stage), where tRNA (actors) interpret the script through translation, assembling amino acids (costumes and props) into a unique protein (performance).	bcf0a2157f18c8641da2a3757dc0a7cc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, is akin to a skilled artisan crafting a detailed sculpture following specific instructions. The first step involves mRNA leaving the nucleus like an artist gathering their blueprints, followed by translation where the ribosomes serve as the sculptor's hands, accurately assembling the amino acids like carefully selected pieces of stone. The third process is translocation acting like the periodical adjustment of the sculpture for optimal work area. Lastly, the protein detaches and under modular editings that equates to final touch-ups on the sculpture, ensuring it's in perfect shape before its useful deployment within or outside of the cell.	5b642895285fc1aa693abcc98587fbad	-1	-1
5	Envision protein synthesis as a recipe. First, mRNA is like an email sent from the 'command centre' nucleus with the recipe for a specific protein, then it reaches the 'factory floor' ribosomes in step two, where tRNA, like ingredient couriers, bring appropriate amino acids in step three according to the 'recipe'. Lastly, these ingredients are assembled into proteins, akin to a finished dish ready for consumption.	9f573f43c8a1ee6718473689470b9f0d	-1	-1
5	Certainly, 'tis like a captivating story told by the fireside. First off, mRNA, as fast as greased lightning, leaves the nucleus and heads straight into the cytoplasm. Second, the ribosome comes into play, reading the mRNA like an eloquent storyteller reading off an ancient scroll. Thirdly, tRNA steps in, acting like a diligent postman delivering amino acids to the ribosome. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together like a daisy chain to form proteins.

5	Well, bless your heart for askin' such an insightful question! Now, imagine protein synthesis like a Southern cook-off. The first step starts off when the mRNA, like our secret barbecue sauce recipe, leaves the kitchen (that's the nucleus), making its way out to the grill (the ribosome). This's where we get to the second stage, translation, where tRNA brings in the ingredients (amino acids) just like how granny used to call in us kids to fetch her some butter or sugar. Now step three is when these ingredients begin to form a polypeptide chain - that's akin to stackin' up yer cornbread high on a plate. Finally, step four is all about protein folding where the polypeptide chain folds into a 3D shape, kinda like how a finished pie gets its perfect crust. That there is your protein all ready and set! Y'all got that?	f89eab8f313ddad2d01d57fb52102fa0	-1	-1
5	1. Leaving the Nucleus: Like a brave adventurer setting sail, the mRNA leaves the comfort of the nucleus, carrying with it the precious coded instructions for protein synthesis. 2. Translation: Arriving in the rough seas of the cytoplasm, it encounters ribosomes, the skilled translators that decode mRNA's language into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins - a scene reminiscent of a complex puzzle being solved piece by piece. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: As this translation goes on, amino acids join together in a chain through peptide bond formation, much like how individual train cars link together to form a longer train. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, like a paper origami transforming from a flat sheet into a three-dimensional masterpiece, this chain folds into a specific shape to form the final functional protein - a testament to nature's awe-inspiring artistry.	86aaeb977070cf969a39147120c600d6	-1	-1

Three, tRNA molecules, dem carry amino acids to the ribosome like ants carry food to anthill, them line up according to the mRNA instructions. Four, ribosome join these amino acids together into a chain, just like how you string mangoes on a line. This chain be the protein wey body need - it be like the fruit we dey wait for after mango tree done grow.	5eb15a703db920a87845107ca3e8e482	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis can be compared to cooking a recipe. First, the mRNA, acting as the 'recipe' leaves the nucleus (the 'recipe box'), then it goes to the ribosome or 'kitchen'. The ribosome 'reads' the mRNA in a process called translation and gathers the ingredients, which are amino acids transported by tRNA or 'grocery delivery service'. These ingredients are then assembled into a protein or 'dish', in a process called elongation. Finally, when the protein is ready, it's released and starts its work in the cell, much like a cooked meal ready to be served and consumed!	177a1bffa892164b7e966eba23e76f73	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like an ambassador carrying a message, mRNA brings genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  2.

5	Alright, here ye go! Once the mRNA gits its ticket oot the nucleus, it's like a postie on a delivery roon. First, he heads to the Ribosome Cafe where tRNA chefs cook up amino acids using mRNA as their recipe. They then string these pieces together, like beads on a necklace to form polypeptide chains. These chains will then fold up quicker than a cheap suit, forming the final protein masterpiece. So it’s no just some mince, it’s quite the performance!	06109f602db5b4af5f690e99a8f2a652	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a beautiful ballet in the cell, with mRNA playing the role of the choreographer. First, mRNA, carrying the dance routine (genetic information), exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it meets the ribosome - the ballet stage. The tRNA dancers then join, each carrying an amino acid, interpreting mRNA's instructions into a fascinating performance - forming a polypeptide chain (the protein). Lastly, this polypeptide chain undergoes further modifications backstage (in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) to become a fully functional protein ready for its grand debut in the body.	a2adb1dc72b1649f325c1bafb1f57353	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated four-part symphony. It begins with mRNA, like the conductor's script, leaving the nucleus (the concert hall) in a process called transcription. Next, it arrives at the ribosome (the orchestra), where translation happens, turning the mRNA's instructions into a chain of amino acids or polypeptide (the music). This chain then goes through a folding process (fine-tuning of the performance) to form a 3-dimensional protein. Lastly, post-translational modifications ensure that this protein is ready for its role in the cellular 'performance', just as finishing touches and rehearsals ensure each symphony is perfect before its debut.	11d58c12322e0b5fcbee776a1a5da866	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus can be compared to a master chef preparing a gourmet meal. The first step is like sending the recipe (mRNA) out of the recipe book vault (nucleus) and into the kitchen (cytoplasm), where it gets read by a cook (ribosome). The second step, translation, could be likened to the cook following each instruction in the recipe, assembling different ingredients (amino acids) to create a dish (protein). The third step is protein folding, where the newly made dish is carefully arranged on a platter for presentation, just as the protein folds into its unique shape. The fourth step, post-translational modification, is like adding final garnishes and seasoning to enhance the taste of the dish; similarly, certain molecules are added or removed to ensure the protein functions optimally.	e0c5824feb7d12d94112d5bd8b495bbc	-1	-1
5	Imagine the process of protein synthesis as a well-orchestrated play, with mRNA leaving the nucleus acting as our lead actor taking centre stage in the cytoplasm. The four major acts in this biological drama then unfold: first is 'Transcription' where genetic information is written into an mRNA script; second, 'mRNA Processing', akin to finalising and editing the script; next, 'Translation' where our protagonist mRNA, accompanied by the ribosome and tRNA co-stars, translates the script into a protein; and finally, 'Protein Folding', where the protein, like a skilled origami artist, folds itself into 3D shapes to perform its role perfectly.	2e3180b83f0a4184a8441b6565222bc4	-1	-1

Now, it's gonna meet up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm - that right there is your catcher ready to grab holda what's comin'. This ribosome starts readin' the mRNA sequence, just like checkin' the signals from the coach. Then, you've got transfer RNA showin' up with their amino acids - these are your baserunners, each one addin' to the chain to build your protein. Lastly, once the whole sequence has been read and all those amino acids have been strung together, it's just like crossin' home plate - bam!

Translation: The mRNA finds its way to the ribosomes, which can be thought of as factories within the cell, where the coded message is read and understood - similar to decoding a secret message. 3. tRNA Matching: In this step, transfer RNA (tRNA) acts as middleman who fetches and delivers the right amino acids based on the code, akin to a postman delivering parcels to the correct address according to the postcodes. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Finally, these amino acids are linked together like beads on a string, creating a long chain called polypeptide, which undergoes further modifications and folding to become a fully functional protein, much like assembling pieces of Lego based on an instruction manual to build a specific model.	72ba8611b022cec6d0d1696e15aebd94	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is like a well-orchestrated play. The mRNA exits the nucleus like an actor stepping onto the stage carrying the script (transcription). It's then read by the ribosome, which acts as the director (translation), using it to assemble amino acids in the exact order, these stand-ins for props (tRNA and polypeptide chain formation). Lastly, the protein folds into its final shape, much like the closing act of our play where everything falls into place (protein folding).	d6086498ae5338e5998014541df92516	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, initiated by mRNA departing from the nucleus, can be likened to a grand theatrical production. mRNA acts as the script leaving the director's office (nucleus), with transcription being the script-reading phase where RNA polymerase plays the role of scriptwriter, transcribing DNA code into a complementary mRNA sequence; next comes translation akin to live staging, where ribosomes (actors) decode mRNA into amino acids sequences like speaking lines in a play; then tRNA serves as the prompter bringing specific amino acids to the ribosome stage; finally, post-translational modifications are like the final rehearsals and costume adjustments before the protein (the complete performance) gets ready to perform its function in the cell.	909caff3b7a19da1047b4fdeced92546	-1	-1

Then, these amino acids link together in a chain faster than you can say ""Bob's your uncle"", forming a polypeptide chain. Lastly, these chains fold onto themselves creating proteins - just like how you'd fold a map after donkey's years of use. It's quite the intricate jig!"	88578005662c6318afa97be5a21d8a92	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's say this whole process is like a good ol' Southern cookout. First off, mRNA's just like the master griller leaving the kitchen (nucleus) with the recipe. It takes that recipe to the grill (ribosome) where Transfer RNA (tRNA), like our trusty grilling tools, brings in specific amino acids, kinda like different cuts of meat, following the recipe in perfect order - this here step's called translation. Then these amino acids get connected in a chain faster than a greased lightning, making us a nice protein 'steak'. Lastly, this fresh-off-the-grill protein gets folded up just right – like folding a pocket square - so it can do its job proper.

At the cellular factory known as the ribosome, this instruction is read, a process called translation.  3. Like a master craftsman, tRNA brings the necessary amino acids to construct the protein.  4. Last but not least, the newly formed protein chain folds into unique shapes analogous to origami, allowing it to perform its specific function in the body.	c70788d9b36f4b426dd51872f19779be	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving Nucleus: Like a messenger carrying important news, mRNA leaves the nucleus with genetic instructions for protein synthesis. 2. Ribosome Binding: The ribosome is like a factory worker who reads these instructions and starts to assemble the protein. 3. tRNA Attachment: This stage is like the delivery of ingredients (amino acids) by a truck (tRNA) to the factory (ribosome). 4. Protein Elongation: This process is akin to building a wall brick-by-brick, where each brick represents an amino acid in the polypeptide chain.	cfdf8cb4a41430b10c70639744fa9683	-1	-1
5	"The process of protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, is akin to a well-orchestrated play with four main acts. First, during transcription, the mRNA transcript is like an actor rehearsing its lines in the nucleus; once ready, it exits the stage and enters the cytoplasm—Act 2: Initiation—where it meets other actors (ribosomes), sparking the commencement of Act 3—Elongation—with tRNA delivering amino acids to the ribosome, much like prop masters bringing items on stage. Finally, Act 4—Termination—occurs when the ribosome hits a ""stop"" codon on mRNA, signifying the end of the play and releasing the newly synthesized protein into the cell."	1d8ff44c6ba131210e90365df11a242b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Translocation: Consider mRNA as a coded secret message leaving the control center (nucleus). 2. Translation Initiation: As if switching on the production line, ribosomes latch onto the mRNA start site. 3. Elongation: Ribosomes, like decoding machines, read the mRNA instructions to add correct amino acids (building blocks) maintaining a chain. 4. Termination: The process halts when 'stop' code is encountered, much like a machine switched off after producing a product (protein).	64946cbdbf1faad60f91b0ed3c05667a	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's the run down for ya. First up, that mRNA is outta the nucleus and gets to work like a foreman on a job site, givin' orders out in the cytoplasm. This is called translation. Next up, you got these lil workers, ribosomes they're called, readin' those orders (the mRNA sequence) like it's the blueprints for a new barn. Now here's where it gets interesting, you got tRNA comin' in like the supply delivery folks, bringin' in amino acids based on them mRNA orders. Finally, these amino acids are strung together tighter than bark on a tree, makin' themselves into a protein. Just like that, you've got yourself protein synthesis!	b9a9afe9c7259d1acbbe231a6bf3f880	-1	-1
5	Righto, here's the lowdown. First, mRNA bails out of the nucleus, like a bloke legging it from a rough pub. Second, mRNA hits up the ribosome, ready for a blether. That’s when translation kicks in - ribosome reads mRNA like a guid book, making sure every word makes sense. Third, tRNA jumps into action, ferrying amino acids to the ribosome like a wee postie during Christmas rush. Last but no least, these amino acids get strung together into a protein, just like threading beads on a string - an intricate masterpiece!	90b9dbb4240be6de9ff04fe281323c6a	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA's exit from the nucleus can be likened to a blueprint leaving an architect's office, carrying crucial information for construction.  2. As the mRNA enters the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome, it's like a key fitting into a lock, setting the stage for protein assembly. 3. The process of translation then begins where tRNA molecules, acting as builders, read and interpret the mRNA blueprint and bring in corresponding amino acids. 4. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together in a chain by peptide bonds, resembling beads strung on a necklace, forming the final protein product.	322113c1ddec52424521b8d9c0bf9a30	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like baking a cake following a recipe. The four major steps include: 1) the Recipe or mRNA leaves the Recipe Box or the Nucleus, carrying the instructions for making the cake or protein; 2) Translation, or Reading the Recipe, where ribosomes read the mRNA and assemble amino acids to form a polypeptide chain (the raw ingredients); 3) Splicing and Folding, or Preparing and Baking, where unwanted sections are removed and the chain is folded into the correct shape (removing egg shells and baking); and finally 4) Post-translational Modification, or Cake Decoration, where additional changes like adding sugars or phosphates (sprinkles or icing) complete the protein.	88ae0d7eedbf386f95dfa99473da93b0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exiting the Nucleus: This is similar to an architect handing over a building blueprint to the construction team. The mRNA, carrying genetic instructions from the DNA in the nucleus, exits into the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: Think of this as finding your workbench. The ribosome, which is the site of protein synthesis, latches onto the mRNA. 3. Translation: Like following a recipe step by step, the ribosome reads each codon (sequence of three nucleotides) on the mRNA and fetches the corresponding amino acid. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, akin to origami transforming a flat paper into a 3D structure, the chain of amino acids folds into a specific 3D shape to form a functional protein.	1f5c5c5e3f9d583be61ac08769f20288	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a detailed recipe being sent from the archive (nucleus) to the kitchen (cytoplasm).

5	Awright, so picture it like this: mRNA is like the T train leavin' North Station, and first stop is Translation where it meets ribosomes, kinda like our Fenway Park. Next, the amino acids, think of 'em as Sox players, brought in by transfer RNA which is like a top-notch scout. Then peptidase enzymes, they're like the coach, sortin' these Sox into the right formation to make a protein - that's your World Series winning play right there. Lastly, once we've got our protein team all set, they're shipped out to wherever in the cell they're needed - just like the fans pourin' outta Fenway after a big win.	2c95073badd7388d46f8775932aaf224	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing, my china. So, you've got to understand protein synthesis like a lekker braai at the weekend, right?  1. ""mRNA leaving the nucleus"": It's like inviting your mates over for a braai - the invite (mRNA) leaves your house (nucleus) to get the message across. 2. ""Translation and Transcription"": This is when your mates arrive and you start translating the hearty boerewors and succulent steak from raw to cooked - that's similar to how mRNA is translated into amino acids and transcribed into proteins. 3. ""tRNA Matching"": Just like matching your favourite Castle Lager with the right cut of meat, tRNA matches each amino acid with its correct place in the sequence. 4. ""Protein Folding"": Finally, after all that vleis has been tucked into, everyone settles down (folds) into a contented bunch, similar to how the protein folds into its final structure to function properly."	5780083060ff1586c388f0a7e6b47851	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a hockey player leaving the bench to get into the game. First, translation is initiated - that's the face-off, where everything gets started. Next, elongation occurs, pretty much like a Canuck on a breakaway, steady and determined. Termination is the third step and it's like scoring a goal - the process has reached its critical point. Lastly, post-translation modifications happen, akin to strategy adjustments after the goal is scored which is all about improving for the next faceoff.	a0c5a533ed3a7721b96badb99bb9314a	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis is like a factory assembly line. First, the ""blueprints"" (mRNA) leave the main office (the nucleus), then they head to the workshop (ribosomes) where workers (tRNA) read the blueprints and fetch necessary parts (amino acids). These parts are then assembled into a final product (protein) by more workers (enzymes). After inspection and folding by quality control (chaperone proteins), the finished product is dispatched to where it's needed in the body."	4ac08915762c4665b3f8fa085ba694fb	-1	-1
5	Richt, here we gang. Mind oan mRNA skooshin' oot the nucleus eftir it's been copied fae DNA? That's step one, like startin' a journey wi' a map. Step twa is whaur tRNA comes intae play - think o' it as a wee delivery van carryin' amino acids tae the ribosome. The third step is the ribosome itself, actin' a bit like a factory floor, where the mRNA and tRNA meet an’ the protein gets built, piece by piece. The last step’s protein modification - sort o' like givin' our newly built machine a guid polish an' makin' sure it's workin' richt.	3b3b46421f58cf0dc1646c2d28e5674d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a multi-step production line with the mRNA as the blueprint. It begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus (the control center) and traveling to the ribosomes (the factory), where it’s translated into an amino acid sequence during translation phase; this is akin to assembling parts according to the blueprint. Afterward, in post-translational modifications (akin to quality control), the protein is finalized into its functional form, ready for use within or outside the cell.	e2c7b5a74b3f019556e098ec783063e6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a detailed recipe being taken from the safety of the cookbook (nucleus) to the kitchen (cytoplasm). The four major steps include: transcription, where mRNA copies the recipe from DNA much like a scribe; mRNA processing, akin to proofreading and finalizing the draft; translation, where the ribosome acts as a chef, reading the mRNA's instructions in the cytoplasm; and protein folding, where the newly made polypeptide chains fold into a specific shape like origami to become a fully functioning protein.	683e56713c907d3c1bd28f4cf1651a24	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a complex cooking recipe. First, the 'recipe' (mRNA) is transcribed in the kitchen (nucleus), then it's taken to the 'chef' (ribosome) in the restaurant (cytoplasm). The chef reads the recipe and gathers ingredients (the process of translation, using tRNA to bring amino acids), combining them in a specific order to create a unique dish (the protein). Finally, this dish is folded into its final shape through protein folding, like delicately arranging the final presentation of a gourmet meal.	be51dd34078950b72285feec37764dd7	-1	-1
5	"1. ""Off like a hare in March,"" the mRNA bids the nucleus cheerio, carrying the genetic message. 2. ""Busy as a bee,"" it joins with ribosomes in the cytoplasm, creating a protein-building workshop. 3. ""Sure, it's been donkey's years,"" tRNA's long-awaited moment arrives as it brings the correct amino acids to the mRNA. 4. ""Fast as greased lightning,"" these amino acids link up in a specific order, crafting a brand new protein, as if they were seasoned hurlers playing a fine puck."	0dd8cbce1af20d4dd1d0be4b84096073	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for asking. Picture this: mRNA's like the town crier stepping out of city hall (the nucleus), hollerin' out instructions. First stop, it runs into the ribosome, kinda like the town's blacksmith shop where transfer RNA brings in amino acids, like iron ore. That's step one and two right there. The next two steps are tRNA acting like the smithy's apprentice, linking them amino acids together to make a protein chain, which then folds itself up tighter than a bullfrog's behind in fly season to make a 3D protein. That's your four major steps in protein synthesis, darlin'.	0634f50ad5d5789b6d2cefd66081b31f	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA leaving the nucleus is like an envoy carrying a blueprint from the command center of a factory. This blueprint (mRNA) provides instructions for making proteins. 2. The mRNA then goes through the ribosome, similar to a construction site where the actual building (protein) is assembled based on the blueprint.  3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) acts like little trucks that transport the necessary materials (amino acids) to this construction site (ribosome).  4. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together at the ribosome following the instructions of the mRNA, creating a chain that will fold into a functional protein. This is akin to assembling blocks according to the blueprint's design to finally create the intended structure.	f21e473dc8645b0fcdab0d384e5d4372	-1	-1
5	The making of protein, it like when a ship leave the harbor. The mRNA, it first come out from nucleus like how a ship set sail from port. Translation then start: tRNA bring in amino acids, just as cargo loaded to the ship; ribosome then work like crane, linking them together into protein - the cargo all tied up secure. Then that protein go where cell say it needed, much like ship carry cargo to final destination.	63f29e13c0e431a56f5244e456bf7320	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus resembles the exciting moment you set off on a journey, carrying with you a treasure map (the genetic information that determines the protein to be produced). 2. The translation of this information in the ribosome is akin to reaching your destination and reading the map, where each codon in the mRNA is like a specific set of instructions on the map. 3. The tRNA molecules, which are like delivery trucks, bring in the correct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), matching them to each codon just like how a truck brings the right materials to construct a building based on blueprints. 4. Finally, these amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide chain - this is akin to constructing a building block by block, until we have our final product: the protein.	09d3549c9813a6cf3c7cd089044276e1	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a letter carrying important information, mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying the genetic instructions needed for protein synthesis. 2. Ribosome Reading: It then heads over to the ribosome, functioning like a factory worker reading blueprints, translating the genetic code into a string of amino acids. 3. tRNA Contribution: Like delivery trucks bringing supplies to a building site, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings each corresponding amino acid to the ribosome. 4. Protein Creation: Finally, these amino acids are linked together in a specific order, similar to building blocks being stacked one on top of another, resulting in the creation of a protein.	8f9b1c26458d5ebe203f2e9e82fa1798	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha! Protein synthesis is like a good ole barn raising. First off, mRNA exits the nucleus like it's leaving the farmhouse to spread the news. Next step is that mRNA hooks up with a ribosome, kind of like matchin' up two farm animals for courtin'. Then tRNA swoops in carryin' amino acids, much like a tractor haulin' hay bales. Last but not least, those amino acids get strung together into a protein chain – think of it as buildin' fence line across your property.	972cbe08d7928093b31181a3ba7a3bfe	-1	-1
5	Right, so imagine the mRNA's like a guid Scotsman carrying a secret recipe from the nucleus (or the kitchen if ye like), first off. Second step is it goes on a trip to the ribosome (like a local chippy), where tRNA (like a cook), uses the recipe to collect the right amino acids. Thirdly, these amino acids are linked together in a chain to make the protein itself - just like stringing together pearls on a necklace. Lastly, after our protein's been crafted, it gets folded into its unique shape, as important as choosing the plaid for your kilt before heading out to a ceilidh.	97e788ffe4fb1e6446f477e2ef8e8dab	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: First off, think of the mRNA as our intrepid traveller saying goodbye to its home and setting forth from the nucleus on a grand journey to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Ribosome Assembly: As the mRNA arrives at the ribosome (the bustling workshop of protein synthesis), it's like a foreman presenting his building plan to the construction site. 3. Translation Process: This step is akin to an interlinguistic conference - codons, sequences of three nucleotides on the mRNA, are translated into amino acids, the language of proteins. It's during translation that tRNA (transfer RNA) play their part as interpreters, ensuring each codon is matched with its specific amino acid. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, we're at the stage where these raw amino acids transform into a functioning protein. To visualise this, picture receiving a flat packed piece of furniture and using the instructions (which is what our mRNA effectively was) you assemble it into a functional item, ready to be put to work in the cell.	04bebddb4e6878a9f0a2a83b09e006f6	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a chef following a recipe.  1. The mRNA, akin to our recipe, travels from the nucleus (the cookbook shelf) to the ribosomes (the kitchen). This is called ""mRNA Processing and Exit from Nucleus"".  2. Then comes 'translation', much like our chef reading the recipe and gathering ingredients - in this case, the ribosomes 'read' the mRNA and gather amino acids. 3. These amino acids are then strung together by tRNA molecules (our chef's hands) into a polypeptide chain (a prepared dish), in a process known as 'Elongation'. 4. Finally, after enough amino acids have been added, the protein (the final delicious meal) detaches from the ribosome and undergoes further processing before it's ready for use. This last step is called 'Termination'."	d2fde72e1d6a4e36565e9a2bb17c3fd4	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis is quite like a master chef following a recipe. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus (the recipe book), it joins with a ribosome (the chef's kitchen) in the cytoplasm where translation process begins (ingredients are gathered). Next, tRNA molecules (the courier service) brings specific amino acids (food ingredients) according to the code on mRNA. Finally, these amino acids link together to create a polypeptide chain (the prepared dish) that folds into protein (the final gourmet meal).	8ef2b98565d7d71faea67f6702df1daa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is a bit like an intricate ballet production. If we consider mRNA as the lead dancer who exits the 'nucleus stage' holding the performance script (genetic code), it heads to the cytoplasm or 'dance floor', where it partners with the ribosome or 'choreographer' (step 1: Initiation). The tRNA, akin to supporting dancers, gracefully enter carrying specific amino acids (the dance moves), which correspond to the mRNA codons or script lines (step 2: Elongation). These amino acids link together in a chain creating a polypeptide or new dance routine (step 3: Termination). The completed protein, just like a finished ballet performance, is then folded and shaped into its functional form by chaperone proteins, similar to a Director putting final touches on the show (step 4: Protein Folding & Processing).	3465c125b99fa89bf4746c1c65a417ce	-1	-1

Step 1 is Transcript'n—think of it as the playahs takin' their stats and skills with 'em. For Step 2, Translation, imagine those skills gettin' put to work on the field. Step 3, RNA splicin', that's like swappin' in some pinch hittahs for strategic advantage. And finally, we got Post-Translational Modification, where you can think of the proteins bein' fine-tuned stronger than a Southie dockworker to make sure they’re performin' just right in the body's big game.	c0ec8915f59fc08af10e313dc786e85a	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's hit the road on this journey of protein synthesis, it's gonna be as thrilling as a safari in the Kruger Park. Our first stop is Transcription, where our mate, the mRNA, takes a snapshot of the DNA's instructions - kind of like a tourist snapping pics at Table Mountain. Then we move onto RNA processing, and here our mRNA gets a quick-quick makeover, like getting decked out in biltong and boerewors for a braai. Next up is Translation, which is where the ribosomes read the mRNA's message, as eagerly as we wait for the springboks to score a try. Lastly, we end with Protein Folding, where these new proteins are folded into complex 3D structures - high as the Drakensberg and strong as a lion!	c204adaecd6678fdb789c5262091117e	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh? Picture protein synthesis like a hockey game. The mRNA exiting the nucleus is like the starting whistle, signalling the beginning of the match. First, the puck (mRNA) flies into cytoplasm, our ice rink, where it meets up with the ribosome, our star player. This ribosome reads the genetic information on the mRNA much like a coach reading a play, decoding it into amino acids, our skilled forwards. Next in line are tRNA molecules that function as swift wingers, carrying specific amino acids to the ribosome based on codons - think of them as precise passes. Following this hand-off, the ribosome links these amino acids together forming a polypeptide chain, akin to scoring a fantastic goal! Lastly, once this polypeptide chain is complete, it folds into a 3D structure to become a functioning protein, just like how after all those passes and goals, you've got yourself a winning team!	1854039b06612281428c9eb7dc6edc98	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like following a recipe to bake a cake. The mRNA, which resembles the written recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box), then steps into the cytoplasm kitchen where it meets the ribosome (the chef). The tRNA (ingredient supplier) reads the instructions on the mRNA and brings in amino acids (ingredients) accordingly to build up a protein (the cake). Finally, in post-translational modifications - akin to icing and decorating the cake - the protein is folded and modified into its functional form.	e3f5f3e97a76d8e2202ab6aefd621e32	-1	-1
5	Weel, imagine mRNA is like a postie takin' messages fae the nucleus (the hert o' operations) tae ribosomes (the wee factories). This starts wi' transcription inside the nucleus (like writin' doon the message), then mRNA leaves the nucleus (like the postie on his roond), lands at a ribosome (the factory), an' translation begins - it's like readin' the instructions an' buildin' the protein. The tRNA brings in amino acids (the buildin' blocks), they get stuck thegither in the richt order tae create yir protein - it's like constructin' a bonnie Lego model fae a blueprint!	1ef616f6765636d099692e360966d072	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's exit from the nucleus is like a well-prepared traveler leaving home, carrying precise instructions for a very significant mission.  2. The process of Translation, akin to decoding an encrypted message, happens in the ribosomes where the mRNA's instructions are read and used to assemble amino acids into specific sequences. 3. Next is the formation of the Polypeptide chain, this is comparable to a complex puzzle being put together piece by piece, as the correct sequence of amino acids forms a long chain. 4. The final step, Protein Folding, can be likened to origami, where the polypeptide chain folds into a specific shape enabling it to perform its specific function in the body.	7c3c96ae81d036c866e05de3376f00b7	-1	-1
5	Certainly, imagine protein synthesis as a well-orchestrated performance. First, mRNA, acting like our main actor, exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, similar to a stage. Second, it encounters the ribosome, a meticulous director, who uses it as a script in the process known as translation. Thirdly, using tRNA, or the supporting cast, amino acids are brought to the ribosome according to the mRNA's instructions. Finally, these amino acids link together in a certain order to create proteins - a marvelous spectacle that is the end product of this precise biological theatre.	5337c178a3dde05634d4397b8cf3e5cf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-rehearsed play, where mRNA is the script leaving the director's office (nucleus). The grand event of protein production features four major acts: 1) Transcription - similar to a playwright penning down his script, DNA's coded message gets transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus; 2) mRNA Processing - a crucial editing process where the script (mRNA) is refined and unnecessary parts are removed; 3) Translation - like actors interpreting their lines, ribosomes read the processed mRNA and translate the genetic information into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins; 4) Protein Folding - finally, akin to actors taking their positions on stage, these amino acids fold into complex structures forming functional proteins.	3114a331304d7c638be1e8f0bc85b263	-1	-1
5	Sure, we're off to the races with protein synthesis starting when mRNA leaves the nucleus like a wee letter heading out for delivery. First, it's onto transcription in the nucleus - that's like jotting down the message on our letter. Second, mRNA toddles off to the ribosome, like a postman on his rounds. Thirdly, translation happens; this is bang on like reading the letter and understanding what's being asked. Finally, tRNA brings in amino acids – they're wet as an otter's pocket with potential – and links them together to form a protein, perfectly wrapping up our message like a gift at Christmas. This process is never on the never never – it’s always happening to keep us hale and hearty!	0496be8f5d7d3e0c82e67480480cd757	-1	-1
5	Well, protein synthesis is a bit like fixin' a meal from scratch. First off, mRNA bolts from the nucleus swifter than a tadpole in a pond. Now that's your recipe card ready. Second, we got this thing called translation where ribosomes, those are like your kitchen tools, use mRNA as a guide to string together amino acids, now these are your ingredients. This concoction forms a polypeptide chain - think of it as your uncooked casserole. Third step is like settin' your oven temp right, it's called protein folding where the chain folds into the right 3D shape. Fourthly and finally, post translational modifications happen, kinda like addin' seasoning and garnish before you serve up that dish. It's all about takin' the right steps at the right time for that perfect end result.	d3dbdce4b8bab3c64aeb410eba5a4ccc	-1	-1

Translation Initiation: This is like arriving at a foreign airport (ribosome), and passing through customs (initiator tRNA attaching to start codon on mRNA). 3. Elongation: Just as a traveller explores different places in a new country, new amino acids get added to the growing protein chain based on specific mRNA codon. 4. Termination: Eventually, like all good trips, protein synthesis ends when a stop codon on mRNA is reached, signalling the end of the journey for our traveller - the protein is complete!	d97a3b76cb950ef03453c010cb47d55e	-1	-1

Polypeptide Formation: Amino acids then link together like building blocks to form a protein.	460b72af3948c9cdac699b20c185a4e6	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, protein synthesis is sorta like baking a cake from a recipe. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus, a bit like our recipe leavin' the cookbook. This is called transcription. Next, the mRNA latches onto a ribosome, just like when you set your recipe down on the counter. We call this initiation. Now, tRNA brings in amino acids - kinda like gatherin' your ingredients - and matches 'em up with the mRNA in the right order. That’s elongation for ya. Finally, the process stops when it hits a stop codon (the end of the 'recipe') and that new protein is released. Just like when you pull your finished cake outta the oven! This last step is termination.	18bc5a5629e8ad1b9a380702c6d2579d	-1	-1
5	Well first off, mRNA storms out the nucleus like a Scot leaving a dodgy pub. Then it's all round the ribosome like a dog after its tail for translation, where tRNA brings in amino acids like a dutiful wee dug fetchin' sticks. These amino acids are strung together to build the protein, as tight as bricks in a Glasgow tenement. Finally, our new protein is sent off to work much like a coal miner to his pit.	8dab0d67769f280a3533bfe2c0e56930	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is quite like a well-organised factory production line. Firstly, mRNA carries genetic instructions, much like a precise blueprint, from the nucleus to the ribosomes in a process called transcription. Secondly, these ribosomes act as factory workers, interpreting the blueprint in a 'language' of codons during translation. Thirdly, transfer RNA (tRNA), akin to delivery trucks, transport specific amino acids based on this code. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together in a chain that folds into a functional protein, similar to a finished product rolling off an assembly line.	862e56d3cc7b843fd6e8f87f4612f1b6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a precise recipe being followed in a kitchen.  1. Transcription: It's like transcribing a recipe from a cookbook (DNA in the nucleus) onto a portable note (mRNA) that can be taken to the kitchen. 2. mRNA Processing: This is comparable to adjusting the recipe note, crossing out unnecessary parts (introns), and highlighting the necessary steps (exons). 3. Translation: Now, our chef (ribosome) uses this refined recipe (mRNA) to assemble ingredients - in our case amino acids - in the correct order to form the protein (dish). 4. Protein folding: Finally, just like how a baked cake takes shape when removed from the oven, the newly synthesized protein folds into its unique 3D structure that defines its function in the cell.	c8ea1290a6cd656259d488e80c38d78e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Think of mRNA as a coded message leaving the nucleus, its mission is to carry the instructions for protein synthesis from the DNA.     2. Translation Initiation: Imagine this as the starting line of a race, where mRNA binds with ribosome and tRNA to set the stage for protein production. 3. Elongation: Picture this as the main part of the race, where amino acids brought by tRNA create a polypeptide chain according to the mRNA's blueprint. 4. Termination: Like crossing the finish line in a race, when the stop codon on mRNA is reached, it signals that our protein is successfully synthesized and it's time to wrap up.	530c32ef17fb4084cd1ebf0a8d8ed3d4	-1	-1
5	Imagine protein synthesis as a recipe with mRNA being the recipe card. First, the 'recipe card' (mRNA) leaves the 'recipe box' (nucleus) and journeys to the 'kitchen' (cytoplasm). Here, it meets the 'chef' (ribosome) who reads the recipe and gathers the 'ingredients' (amino acids), linking them in a specific order to create a 'dish' (protein). Then, the finished 'dish' folds into a unique shape, crucial for its function. Like serving a meal, the protein is then transported within or out of the cell to perform its function.	23f4dd9a601251e6220ea161e81f97b0	-1	-1
5	Oh, ya lookin' for the 411 on protein synthesis, huh? Alright, let's kick this off.   1. mRNA's like a Sox fan leavin' Fenway, exitin' the nucleus and makin' its way to the ribosome, the city's hotspot if you will. 2. Translation starts then, quieter than a midnight in the Commons – tRNA molecules waltzin' in, each bearin' an amino acid and matchin' up with the mRNA codons, kinda like finding your seat at the Gahden. 3. These amino acids start linkin' together to form a nascent protein chain, slower than molasses in January but trust me, it's gettin' there. 4. Finally, after the stop signal is hit on mRNA, this shiny new protein gets folded into its functional shape - higher than Hancock tower! That's your protein synthesis in a nutshell.	b3e5ffe18c0040547ac02014199fd030	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, boet! So, four steps in protein synthesis, hey? Let's kick off with mRNA exiting the nucleus, like a rugby ball after a solid boot. Then you've got translation where the ball - I mean, mRNA - is caught by the ribosome. This jock of a ribosome reads it like a coach with a playbook, translating the info to amino acids. These lads are then strung together in a polypeptide chain, coming together like teammates holding the line. Lastly, the protein gets folded into its final form, just like how we tuck into a lekker vetkoek at the end of a long day. Each part plays its role, and just like in rugby, every pass matters!	cedb878ef48e198a30db0165e709042b	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is a process as changeable as Maritime weather, but here are four key steps: 1. mRNA, carrying information like a letter with hot news from Toronto in July, leaves the nucleus. 2. Ribosomes, acting like eager readers, attach to the mRNA initiating translation. 3. tRNA molecules, steady as a Canuck's resolve, bring specific amino acids to the ribosome-mRNA complex. 4. The amino acids bond and form a protein chain, completing the process akin to finishing a puzzle. These steps ensure that our cells can make proteins necessary for life! Just like how Canada's diverse weather combines to create its unique climate.	1a2104241850479162bdf70237499cb7	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is akin to a factory production line. First, the mRNA blueprint leaves the nucleus office, it then travels along the ribosome assembly line where tRNA workers attach matching amino acid parts (translation). As this chain grows, it bends and folds (protein folding) into a unique 3D product, ready for use or delivery by chaperone proteins - our quality control and shipping department!	b64546c259cf196d18fd6593e6cbc1b4	-1	-1
5	Aye, it's a bit like bakin' a loaf. First, yer mRNA escapes the nucleus - that's like gettin' yer recipe. Next, it heids tae the ribosome, which is sort o' like preheatin' yer oven. Then, tRNA brings in amino acids - that's gatherin' yer ingredients. Last off, they're all put thegither in the right order by the ribosome - just like mixin' and bakin' yer dough into a fine loaf!	f249ba3c8712691bcab2e9650795a6c5	-1	-1
5	Sure, I can provide the answer in the form of an analogy. 1. mRNA leaves the nucleus (like a coded message leaving the control room). 2. It lands on a ribosome in the cytoplasm (like that message being received at a factory workstation). 3. tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the mRNA (like workers bringing raw materials according to the message). 4. The amino acids are joined together to form a protein (like assembling parts to construct a product).	a35c01fe34fbf2566c08f5da02eed627	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, is like a relay race with four crucial stages. Firstly, the mRNA - the baton - leaves the starting point (nucleus), carrying vital information. It then passes through the ribosome (second runner) where translation occurs, converting the coded information into an amino acid sequence (third runner). Lastly, these sequences fold themselves forming functional proteins (final runner crossing the finish line), the end product of this intricate molecular race.	da549464ce3e08219dc2e6614f171901	-1	-1
5	Consider protein synthesis like attending a grand play, where mRNA is the script leaving the director's (nucleus) office. The four major acts include: Act 1, 'Transcription', where the nuclear script (DNA) is copied into a transportable version (mRNA); Act 2, 'Export and Maturation', where mRNA exits the director's office, removing any irrelevant scenes (introns); Act 3, 'Translation', where actors (ribosomes) interpret the mRNA script into the language of proteins (amino acids); Act 4, 'Folding and Processing', akin to rehearsing and refining the performance, where proteins are shaped and modified for their final role in the cell's theatre.	f767a677e92eed83a0e3a2848cf6a6c2	-1	-1
5	Sure, in the dance of life, mRNA is like our message carrier. The first step is it high tails it out of the nucleus carrying genetic instructions, as precious as a winning lotto ticket. Then, it meets a ribosome and they get along like a house on fire - this is where the translation happens. Third step's as crucial as the All-Ireland Final, tRNA comes into play, carrying amino acids to the mRNA-ribosome complex - sure isn't that the meat and potatoes of the protein? Lastly, these amino acids bond together, creating a protein chain longer than your mammy's shopping list. This process continues until we have a full-fledged protein, crafted with precision just like an Aran sweater.	73acbba0be24e6115e064e95111f0967	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's get this show on the road. First off, our trusty mRNA fella skedaddles right outta the nucleus through a lil' thing called a nuclear pore. Then we got these tiny building blocks, amino acids, they keep linkin' up one after another 'til some wise-guy STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site, bringin' the whole operation to a standstill. That there's your protein synthesis in a nutshell.	d320b17e21e00b88499ad4c85e9d3ec8	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template in the nucleus and then exits to reach the cytoplasm.  2. Translation Initiation: The mRNA strand binds to a ribosome, starting at the START codon in the P site where protein synthesis begins. 3. Elongation: Transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying corresponding amino acids bind to the mRNA codons, linking adjacent amino acids together. 4. Termination: When a STOP codon is reached on the mRNA strand, the newly formed protein is released and the process ends.	1b7a8266b07e5005332f25637ddaa1bc	-1	-1
5	Mwen ka di ou ke, mRNA a soti nan nukleyis la atravè pò nukleyè. Apre sa, li vwayaje nan sitoplasma jiskaske li rive nan ribozom oswa li antre nan retikulum endoplasmic grenn.	2aad8802c80ebf1df07c6528ff4e630d	-1	-1
5	Following the mRNA's egress from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, protein synthesis initiates via the association of a START codon located in the P site, consequently leading to the concatenation of amino acids to form a protein.	af9bd7d42d15a328c8696903e5c8f99f	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it encounters tRNA which carries an anticodon that identifies and binds to the complementary codon of the mRNA. This process is part of protein synthesis where the information carried by mRNA is used to assemble amino acids into a protein.	ade557e86e20092515a61f2f7ccaaa88	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, first things first, after the mRNA heads on outta the nucleus, it hitches a ride on a ribosome. Then, tRNA, carryin' the anticodon that matches up with the mRNA's codon (we're talkin' U to A and C to G here), spots its partner and they join up. Next thing ya know, these amino acids start linin' up one after another, like cars at the county fair. Keeps on goin' till a STOP codon on that there mRNA gets read in what they call the A site, puttin' an end to this hoedown.	0ae1a90e1301e1191d065f584e1ea851	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks aff wi' mRNA scootin' oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This process continues as amino acids are strung thegither, startin' wi' a START codon in the P site, to create a protein - it's like mony a mickle maks a muckle, but with molecules!	daa988470c48bdd7e73ecf8e98f8105f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the exit of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus, which is subsequently recognised by transfer RNA (tRNA) via complementary base pairing (U=A, C≈G) of anticodons and codons. Following this, protein creation begins at a START codon located within the P site, marking the initiation phase whereby amino acids are sequentially linked.	de3607a4e68676cdbd3fbd77d555acd4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus and a START codon aligns with the P site, triggering the coupling of specific amino acids to construct a protein. The process continues as the attached amino acids on tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids, facilitating their linear assembly into a protein.	22b66dbaeb29c3a6253e178100020cb5	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the process of protein synthesis involves four significant steps. These steps include translation initiation where mRNA, the first tRNA and ribosomal subunits assemble, elongation where the polypeptide chain is formed as tRNA molecules bring in amino acids, reading of the STOP codon on mRNA by release factor leading to termination, and post-translational modifications where proteins are further processed or directed to their specific cellular locations.	af457d0215d0a965a19ca4e7ecf38000	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to reach its destination, either the ribosome for immediate translation or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum for further modifications. This process is part of a complex network known as translocation, which facilitates molecular movement within the cellular milieu, and it sets the stage for protein synthesis by providing a template used in the translation process.	16f3b4aa778027a637feee1ab887d8fc	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA hops the fence outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's off to the races. It's readin' codons quicker than a Sox fan tallyin' runs in a blowout, linkin' amino acids together till it hits a STOP sign, just like rush hour on 93.	869f0da73a7b2488541a542a7ced7535	-1	-1
5	Sure, boet, let's break it down quick-quick. First up, mRNA heads off on a trek from the nucleus to the ribosome. Then, our mate tRNA carries an anticodon that's the doppleganger of mRNA's codon - like finding your twin at a braai, you know? After they've high-fived, the amino acids hitched on tRNA get cosy with their neighbours to form a new protein. It's slow as a wet week but hey, a leopard doesn't change its spots.	d478db8d2747bb20bdf4873c0f18c729	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journey's as swift as a Calgary wind through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, showcasing a process as steady as a Canuck's resolve.	0e9be46bde7b5cb98e74bb0a4cdd6b82	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus, it journeys into the cytoplasm and towards the ribosome or alternatively, is introduced into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, a process called translation takes place where the corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA form peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids on other tRNA molecules, thus synthesizing a protein.	39e4ef10008b63c7fdb410b26e3fbeb2	-1	-1
5	A'richt, first aff, mRNA bails oot the nucleus an then gets read by the ribosome in a process we ca' translation. Next up, the tRNA brings in amino acids that match the codons on the mRNA an these bonnie lads get linked thegither until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA.	28a8be3c19dbd494f98e912b16738b4e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, then in a process known as translation, the ribosome in the cytoplasm deciphers the code from the mRNA's codons. Here, tRNA molecules carrying corresponding anticodons, through Watson-Crick base pairing (U=A, C≡G), recognize and bind to these mRNA codons while their other end, attached with specific amino acids, facilitates peptide bond formation between adjacent amino acids, thus progressively building the polypeptide chain that makes up the protein.	1c58c31afd1703283d05d79d394124c1	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exit from the nucleus, the four primary stages of protein synthesis comprise: 1) Translation initiation in which the ribosome identifies a START codon on mRNA and establishes the P site for peptide bond formation; 2) Elongation, where anticodons on tRNA molecules correspond to mRNA codons and position specific amino acids for binding; 3) This process continues along the mRNA strand, linking adjacent amino acid sequences together; 4) Termination transpires once a STOP codon is reached, concluding protein assembly.	85cbcbd4c67fdc2494767463192c7fc4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the mRNA, encoded by codons (triplets of bases), exits the nucleus and is interpreted by the rRNA. The sequential assembly of amino acids, forming the protein, is instigated by a START codon located in the P site, marking the commencement of this intricate biological process.	11087a73a553362939858d820400775c	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA escapes the nucleus through the nuclear pore, quicker than a wet otter's pocket, it pays a visit to the ribosome. There, like a well-oiled machine that's been running for donkey's years, it meets tRNA molecules, each with an amino acid in tow, and they all get together for a bit of a hooley; amino acids on adjacent tRNAs bond together, crafting a brand new protein bang on.	bc8922480a3ae7e48cf8bb8ee65d5f54	-1	-1
5	Well, reckon it's a bit like this: After that mRNA high-tails it out the nucleus, first thing it does is link up with a ribosome--kinda like finding a dance partner at a hoedown. Then, tRNA molecules, each lugging around its own amino acid, start lining themselves up along that mRNA strand just as orderly as peas in a pod. Now these tRNA molecules are carryin' codons that match up with the mRNA, and when they find their partner, they bond together faster than biscuits disappearing at breakfast. This keeps on going till we hit a STOP codon on that mRNA; when that happens, the amino acid chain cuts loose from the ribosome, and we got ourselves a brand new protein. It's a hard row to hoe, but that's how our cells keep us ticking.	333d42a10c0db056416cb66db6714189	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, bearing the genetic code, leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum for protein production.  2. Following this, tRNA carrying the anticodon that complements the codon of mRNA (U pairs with A, and C pairs with G), recognizes and binds to it, a crucial step towards assembling amino acids into a protein chain.	e5e4775e0ccf2d1bad6018e7a574608a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start off when mRNA leave nucleus and the first major step involve initiation where amino acids start link up together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in what dem call the P site. Then, for the next big step, a new corresponding amino acid get added to the tRNA.	ab12b69f0d7b0c1e55d30adc83656b0a	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: The first step of protein synthesis starts in the nucleus where mRNA is produced by the process of transcription, copying the DNA sequence for a specific gene.  2. mRNA Export: Once transcription is complete, the mRNA molecule exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore to reach the cytoplasm. 3. Translation: At the ribosomes or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the process of translation occurs, where the mRNA sequences are read and translated into amino acids sequences, forming a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding and Post-Translation Modifications: The synthesized polypeptide chain then folds into a specific 3D structure to form a functional protein; this may also be accompanied by further modifications like addition of certain molecules for full functionality.	8a66591307a8777b891b6fa3e5e03d8c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs the nucleus using a nuclear pore. 2. It then journeys through cytoplasm towards the ribosome or it goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	25a8e3b202820ba9c8b18271e4491c93	-1	-1
5	Well, first things first, that mRNA is gonna scuttle on outta the nucleus all ready to start this whole shebang. Then, it's almost like they're readin' a recipe, these little three-part chunks—codons, they're called—come up and get processed by somethin' called rRNA. Now we're at the part I ain't seen in a coon's age: initiation. This is where those amino acids start to link up like a county fair chain gang, kickstarted by the START codon sittin' pretty in the P site. It's a mess, nearly like herding cats, but when it's all said and done, you got yourself a brand new protein. Ain't science finer than frog hair?	85ab11af954fba73fb9ea534a752f837	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA bounces oot of the nucleus and is read by the ribosome, kickin' off the process. Then tRNA, wi' its complementary anticodon, recognises and binds to the mRNA's codon, and finally the amino acids carried by the tRNA are bonded together to form a protein - as strong as a lion building his den.	97333ff836bf88aea67f6458b467b548	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and then the corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA bond together with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	0db2da7582ad3f7084ec9ab2913a29b7	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being interpreted by rRNA in triplets, known as codons. The corresponding anticodon, present on a tRNA molecule, recognizes its complementary codon on the mRNA, ensuring each amino acid is added to the growing protein chain in the correct order.	247c1d5cc1df191b5c71a86bbfdc0a8c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic information for the creation of a protein. This genetic sequence is then read on a ribosome in a process called Translation, where tRNA molecules match specific codons on the mRNA to their corresponding amino acids, effectively building the protein structure during Elongation; this process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, signaling Termination and hence, completing protein synthesis.	1ff446aefe2cf7fe16a5ab24f399e74b	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, messenger RNA (mRNA) navigates through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or alternatively enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it subsequently engages in protein synthesis.	9a914b8862b42046b5db66112d5f20ab	-1	-1
5	Aftah leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA books it faster than a Sox fan trying to catch the T after a game, headin' into the cytoplasm. There, it either hits up a ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, like a townie bar-hopping in Southie on a Friday night.	cfd9475f37a2a526b3f9c20ec8128ccb	-1	-1
5	"Firstly, mRNA, like a veld fire, quickly exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then it's off to the races, or as we'd say in South Africa, it's ""off to the polls"", where it meets up with a ribosome and tRNA for the translation phase. A leopard doesn't change its spots, and just like that, each tRNA molecule ensures it brings along an amino acid that corresponds precisely to the codon it matches on the mRNA. Lastly but not leastly, it’s small-small steps from here my china: these amino acids are strung together like a colourful string of Mardi Gras beads which ends up forming our much-needed protein."	611c1e7fc5750e90da727a1f809d1620	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, the initial step in protein synthesis is translation initiation where the mRNA attaches to a ribosome. The second step occurs when a tRNA carrying an anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon arrives. This moves into elongation, where additional amino acids are brought by tRNA and linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, marking termination.	86db57c8852708dbed8b7afb64229949	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus, leading to the initiation stage where a START codon settles in the P site linking amino acids to form proteins. The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three, known as codons, facilitated by rRNA, ensuring precise translation and protein assembly.	cfb22fb36d6920680f369ac082f9a21c	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA birls oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, makin its wey tae the ribosome. Next up, matchin amino acids at the ither end o' the tRNA get attached tae neighbourin tRNA’s amino acids, buildin up the protein.	e580cd166d4166898e559257015f091b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm. Once there, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the sequence of codons, which are triplets of bases on the mRNA, in order to assemble the corresponding amino acids into a protein.	dd764e84b2b0f92dac60604c2e5cc6c2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching to the ribosome, where tRNA molecules carrying anticodons recognize the complementary codon on the mRNA. The process continues with the linking of amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	afd51dfe49bc76526ccaf8ca7879df15	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the initiation step where a START codon is identified on the mRNA in the P site, initiating the linking of amino acids to form a protein. This process continues with the elongation and termination phases, during which amino acids are continuously linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site is read, marking the end of protein synthesis.	2bfaf943bea2e734becbaf45fe9f942a	-1	-1
5	Indeed, protein synthesis is a quare important process! First off, mRNA bunks off from the nucleus and takes a bit of a wander through the cytoplasm until it finds a ribosome or it might get into the rough endoplasmic reticulum on the never never. Then, the mRNA bases are read in triplets, these are called codons, sure isn't it the rRNA that does all this reading, but if things go arseways here, the whole operation could go belly up.	5692c1c2f5a262165c3da251f2f78121	-1	-1
5	First off, you've got this little fella called mRNA. Well, it up and leaves the nucleus, traveling through the wide-open expanse of the cytoplasm towards an awaiting ribosome or decides to venture into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, just like finding a needle in a haystack, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets - these are known as codons, y'all. This ain't no small task.	6aa8bc70fbf4a3c10291e62e0f44a1df	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which it moves to a ribosome where translation occurs. During this translation process, each codon on the mRNA is recognized by a specific tRNA, which then adds a new corresponding amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain, forming the protein.	f6786b1dd7bd914461b9e9114ebad825	-1	-1
5	First step, mRNA be leaving nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to find ribosome or it go inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the tRNA wey carry the anticodon wey match (U=A, C+G) come recognize the codon wey match for inside mRNA.	abb1321282b8e2a0130026fbbebbcf85	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the tRNA's matching amino acids are bonded to one another, forming a chain, which is a crucial step in the synthesis of proteins.	03aac55f2a84abcd552fcb0f330be700	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, carrying genetic information from the DNA, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels across the cytoplasm.  2. Upon reaching its destination, which could be either ribosomes or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, it serves as a template for building proteins in a process called translation. 3. During translation, tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids that match codons (series of three nucleotides) on the mRNA. 4. The ribosome facilitates the bonding of these amino acids to form a polypeptide chain, which eventually folds into a functional protein.	0e5a9694f830dd7e9785640f4ec08845	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, protein synthesis is a real knee-slapper to explain. Now when that doggone mRNA leaves the nucleus, that's your kickoff point. From there, the first big step is what we call initiation - that's like openin' the barn door at dawn. The START codon in the P site gets things movin', linkin' those amino acids together to start makin' a protein. Now, this ain't no short sprint, it's more like a long haul truckin' job. The amino acids keep on linkin' in what we call the elongation phase. That's till a STOP codon on the mRNA gets read over in the A site and says enough is enough - we call this termination. It's kinda like when Ma rings the dinner bell, you know it's time to stop what you're doin'. And there ya have it, those are your four major steps of protein synthesis.	5c721ec09422a376b812ecb9b73ff6b9	-1	-1
5	Aye, so first off, mRNA bides its time then legs it oot the nucleus. Then, during a process we call translation, the mRNA teams up wi' the ribosome an' tRNA, which is like finding the right tool in your shed for the right job (initiation). Ye know how they say 'mony a mickle maks a muckle'? Well, that's exactly what happens next - the ribosome reads the mRNA in groups of three bases (codons), and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid brought over by the tRNA (elongation). It's nae different than building a wall brick by brick. Finally, this all keeps going until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site (termination), kinda like when you've had enough of your pal's blethering.	61874c9c3a5fb78cfc5318400e16a3e7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or penetrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with amino acids being linked together during elongation until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, signalling termination of the protein chain.	934431cb29a8dca18b57e8fc52c24002	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome, where its bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The process proceeds with the initiation phase, where the START codon is positioned in the P site, leading to the linkage of amino acids which eventually formulate a protein.	7f41ad883f209c9cb2d3891a90b201aa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where it travels to the ribosome or is directed into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In a process of elongation and termination, amino acids are continually linked together according to the sequence on the mRNA until a STOP codon is read in the A site, concluding the protein synthesis.	4bdf221b4e7c5dcf1ea3500c4cf921f3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and travelling to the ribosome where, in a process called initiation, a START codon is recognised in the P site, signalling the start of amino acid assembly. The tRNA molecules bring their corresponding amino acids which are then joined together in sequence by peptide bonds, progressively extending the protein chain; this constitutes the elongation phase.	ab45863c33a49a9d999fe8fc06065471	-1	-1
5	Aight kid, here's how it goes down: first off, ya mRNA scoots outta the nucleus quicker than a car on the Pike, right? Then, this thing called tRNA, it's got the job of carrying the complementary anticodon, you know, U equals A and C plus G stuff, and it recognizes its buddy the mRNA's codon. Now these mRNA bases, they're read in these things called triplets or codons (by some bigshot called rRNA) - slower than molasses in January but accurate as Fenway's Green Monster. After that it’s like a construction site up higher than the Hancock tower with all those amino acids linking together to form a protein. That there is your protein synthesis in four wicked steps.	26e8b796d45c774e16a38fecc287eaff	-1	-1
5	Sure, my bru. So, after the mRNA makes a grand exit from the nucleus via this nuclear pore, it's strong as a lion and ready for action. Now the magic starts; this ou kicks off with a START codon parked in the P site, linking our amino acids small-small to form a protein, and that's how we roll on the protein synthesis highway.	4a4f987792b848b4bb17ffd0e13fa83c	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis kicks off bigger than a prairie sky. The first step is mRNA migration to the ribosome, where tRNA, as changeable as Maritime weather, carries the complementary anticodon and recognizes the mRNA's codon. This triggers the process of translation where amino acids are linked in a process as swift as a Calgary wind until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signifying elongation and termination.	59094b1df16c2771672e37630e084030	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and navigates towards the ribosome through the cytoplasm, or alternatively, enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The journey continues with rRNA reading the mRNA bases in groups of three, referred to as codons, which are essentially instructions for the specific sequence of amino acids to be linked together to form a protein.	f072f6678f5201b86c5ed04f5875d131	-1	-1
5	First aff in oor list, mRNA maks its wey oot the nucleus through a wee gap kent as the nuclear pore. Next up, the tRNA, bearing the anticodon that's a mirror image (U=A, C=G) of the mRNA's ain codon, clocks it and gets ready for action.	17a25b47199e9d4181148637b37e922a	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosomes where it is read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in groups of three bases known as codons. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA) which carries specific amino acids binds to the corresponding mRNA codon, allowing adjacent amino acids from different tRNAs to bond together, thus forming a polypeptide chain that will fold into a functional protein.	d7056477000307bf31416dfb7b35fb2d	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis commences with the initiation phase where a START codon is positioned at the P site, sparking the assembly of amino acids into a protein. This process continues with the elongation phase, where each tRNA molecule recognizes its corresponding codon on the mRNA and adds a new matching amino acid to the growing peptide chain until it reaches a stop codon, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	b32c87cfacab5f599a6d402bcba2d17e	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, messenger RNA (mRNA), having exited the nucleus, traverses the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum where translation begins. This process involves a series of key steps including the transfer RNA (tRNA) bringing corresponding amino acids which are successively bonded together to form a growing polypeptide chain, thereby creating the protein.	31cb5611157298e6a9fa21c62e3db9a2	-1	-1
5	Well, the protein synthesis kicks off arseways with mRNA scarpering from the nucleus as fast as greased lightning. This is quickly followed by tRNA carrying a mirror image of an anticodon, recognising its mate on the mRNA, then there's a quare rush as amino acids start linking together to form a protein, taking their starting position at the START codon in the P site - sure isn't it a fine dance altogether!	e38082aeb63f7c10aca71c2a1bf827f8	-1	-1
5	"Well, sugar, the way I see it, you got four big steps to this protein synthesis dance. First off, that mRNA has got to skedaddle out of the nucleus and head to the ribosome. That's like home base for this whole operation.  Next up, you got transfer RNA (tRNA for short) carrying on its back what we call an anticodon. Now, this ain't nothing but a match for the codon on the mRNA. Kinda like finding your sweetheart at a barn dance. They recognize each other, they pair up - only instead of do-si-do, they're linking up amino acids. Then we move on to the elongation phase - that's when the amino acids keep on linking like a chain, one after another. It's a right fine string of beads made out of amino acids. And lastly, all this keeps going until a STOP codon comes along on that mRNA in the A site. When that happens, it's like someone called out ""last dance"", and everything comes to a halt. That's your termination phase. And voila! You got yourself a brand-new protein. Ain't that something?"	955fdc4e17d12fd253e964b925f0e22a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, moving into the cytoplasm. 2. The mRNA then attaches to a ribosome where the process of translation starts. 3. Translation begins at the START codon in the P site, which signals for an amino acid to be brought over by a tRNA molecule. 4. These amino acids are then linked together in a sequence determined by the mRNA, forming the protein.	cdb7d7a477b491fa85637e5878f659c0	-1	-1
5	mRNA, after it lef the nucleus, it tek a trip go cross the cytoplasm to the ribosome or it enter inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then them amino acids weh correspond pon the other end of the tRNA, them get bond up wid the next tRNA's amino acids.	fea5618c1b22c93e15801d5dc4a26c7c	-1	-1
5	After departing the nucleus, the mRNA makes its journey into the cytoplasm and heads towards the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, right? Then, a protein is constructed as amino acids are assembled together, starting with an initiation at a START codon in the P site – doesn't that sound fascinating?	bea4293e545b88504b81d0ae2ccf3103	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome, starting protein synthesis. 2. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads mRNA in groups of three bases, named codons. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) attaches to each codon, bringing with them specific amino acids. 4. Finally, these amino acids bond together to form a protein chain, through the tRNA's other end.	7e7081d84c36079b7c2bea942d85ad25	-1	-1
5	Well now, first up we got the mRNA scootin' on outta the nucleus. Next, it's like a county fair, with each mRNA codon at the stand, and tRNA molecules playing match-up with their anticodons - that's a right holler! Then, it's like trying to herd cats, but these tRNAs somehow line up all proper in the ribosome fitting their amino acids together. And lastly, they start chainin' together these amino acids into one big protein, beginning from the START codon - fancy that!	371efcf7d97a3291e30bd09996bce002	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA skites oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a bit like a bairn fleein' school at the end o' the day. Then, the sturdy tRNA, as strong as a lion, steps in, toting the anticodon that's a dead ringer for the mRNA's codon - it's all about matchin' up the U with A and C with G here.	cf8b8b86ab8df66a76bff1bb311953e7	-1	-1
5	The first step happens when mRNA leaves the nucleus and arrives at the ribosome where protein synthesis begins with an initiation phase, amino acids are linked starting from a START codon in the P site. The following steps involve transfer RNA (tRNA) - they carry amino acids to the mRNA and link them together. Here is the interesting part - on the other end of each tRNA, the corresponding amino acids bond to the neighbouring tRNA's amino acid, creating a chain which will eventually form a complete protein.	4fd89e41928b4def67aa3450c9c5bcfb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, an exciting journey it undertakes to reach the ribosome. The crux of protein creation occurs when the corresponding amino acids on the tRNA's other end form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, a fascinating process that forms long chains, aka our desired proteins!	5d1c2153f3d981a92b8cf987a16b5668	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and making its way to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, traversing through the cytoplasm. Once there, in a process known as initiation, amino acids start to form a chain by linking together, all beginning at a START codon located in the P site, which eventually results in the creation of a protein.	75098bc6cee4a37d8981631ab66520b5	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA, carrying the copies of genetic instructions, says a hearty goodbye to the nucleus through a structure called the nuclear pore, quite an effective exit strategy don't you think? Secondly, it's then deciphered in triplets or 'codons' by the diligent rRNA, much like reading a book three letters at a time, isn't it fascinating?	e7b39f9a188ad213a3b8bb1e1b6a1ff5	-1	-1
5	Aight, so ya gotcha mRNA bouncin' out the nucleus, right? First thing’s first, this guy called tRNA, smahta than a Harvard grad, carries an anticodon, that's like a secret handshake for the mRNA codon. Then, faster than a Sox pitchah throwin' heat, the amino acids at the otha end of the tRNA bond togetha with the next tRNA's amino acids, makin’ a chain denser than a bowl of chowda.	ac549b827a4e1ebc7096de594e285a0f	-1	-1
5	Sure, no problem! So, when the mRNA says cheers to the nucleus and takes a quick-quick trip to the cytoplasm, it meets up with ribosomes where its bases are read in groups of three, like reading a recipe in the kitchen - these are called codons. This is lekker because each codon matches with an amino acid on a tRNA molecule, just like boerewors fits perfectly on a braai stand. Now, this tRNA is not alone, it's got mates on either side and their amino acids bond together, quicker than veld fire. And voila, we've got ourselves a protein – as dry as the Karoo's humour!	18f1adefb5e65d1a04a611665e938bfb	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA bidding adieu to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's off to the races, swift as a Calgary wind. As changeable as Maritime weather, amino acids keep on linking like a never-ending chain until a STOP sign, or codon, pops up in the mRNA's A site causing a full stop - this process is known as elongation and termination.	cec506d015fef46c49fb248730e436f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves towards the ribosome, where a process called initiation takes place. Here, amino acids are linked to start forming a protein, triggered by a START codon located in the P site. Then, using rRNA, the mRNA's bases are read in groups of three known as codons, ensuring each amino acid is added in the correct sequence.	b141048115e411f90fbb0f1a3596ca0b	-1	-1
5	Richt, sae first off, the mRNA birls oot the nucleus tae kick aff protein synthesis. The amino acids get strung thegither startin' wi' a START codon in the P site, this is whit we ca' initiation. Git that right? Nae bother. Then, these bonnie little amino acids oan the ither end o' the tRNA are bonded wi’ neeborin’ tRNA’s amino acids. A' this links thegither tae mak a protein. Nae bad, eh?	8f305a4e40b5e65130561c358d3883a5	-1	-1
5	1. The first major step in protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching to the ribosome, where its bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by a type of RNA called rRNA - isn't it fascinating how these microscopic components communicate?  2. Next comes the intriguing process of translation, where each codon is matched with a corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying a specific amino acid. 3. Have you ever wondered how proteins get their complex structures? Well, as each tRNA matches its codon on the mRNA, the amino acid it carries forms a bond with the adjacent amino acid brought by the next tRNA! 4. Finally, after all codons have been read and all the corresponding amino acids have been bonded together, they form a polypeptide chain - this essentially is the newly synthesized protein! What an amazing journey from a mere molecule to a vital protein, don't you think?	ca79c60bd91547650c423a79fb6ca962	-1	-1
5	1. Initiation: Isn't it intriguing to know that the protein synthesis journey begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome, where it encounters a START codon in the P site, setting the stage for amino acids to start linking together?  2. Elongation: Can you imagine how, with each codon read by the ribosome from the mRNA, a new amino acid is added to the growing chain, like an intricate beading process? 3. Termination: What if I told you that this process of elongation continues until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site? Yes, this signals an end to the amino acid chain. 4. Protein folding and release: Have you ever considered what happens after termination? The newly created protein is then folded into its functional form and released, all ready to perform its designated function within the cell.	cd085e843d2735147a4c86cb93c6dd0e	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, having recorded the genetic information for a specific protein, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process then continues with initiation, where a START codon in the P site signals the linking of amino acids to create the desired protein.	7bdfb29abf74513c87cd3cbd65d23b9f	-1	-1
5	Well now, isn't protein synthesis a process as rare as hen's teeth! It all begins when mRNA gives the nuclear pore the old heave-ho and heads out of the nucleus. Then, faster than a hurling puck, tRNA swoops in and aligns its corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids - bang on job it does too!	456eba06efc1de0d5262a5db2117d299	-1	-1
5	Well, I'll be! You're askin' 'bout the nitty-gritty of protein synthesis. It kicks off when mRNA, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, hightails it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, tRNA, cute as a button but as useful as a chocolate teapot, recognizes its partner by totin' the anticodon that matches up just right with the codon on mRNA.	e6601866b02b55eae094f61405c92df8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and getting attached to the ribosome, which functions as a workbench. The mRNA is then read by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules that bring in appropriate amino acids, forming a chain that extends until a STOP codon is encountered on mRNA. This process ensures the formation of a protein through stages of initiation, elongation, and termination.	581874bf2987aa79c8a103cb1f1a5735	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exit nucleus an' reach ribosome. After, tRNA truck in the amino acids dem. Dem link up like bredren based on mRNA instructions till dem spot a STOP sign inna di A site. So it's all about connectin', buildin', stoppin'. Cool nuh man?	c0a0b4812267ade80cc68ee51d41b559	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, exiting the nucleus, journeys robustly through the cytoplasm to secure its position either in a ribosome or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, an intricate process unfolds where the corresponding amino acids attached to the tRNA form strong bonds with amino acids of neighboring tRNA, a fundamental step towards fabricating proteins!	5669c80049bee1d3e28f95d232c27a13	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. 2. In the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the mRNA and tRNA brings the correct amino acids. 3. These amino acids are bonded together to form a protein chain. 4. This protein then undergoes further processing and folding into its final shape.	0700376b65afa6300f26be210c6d672c	-1	-1
5	You betcha, here's how it works: Once the mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus, it hitches a ride on over through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we're off to the races! Amino acids start linin' up orderly-like and getting stitched together into a protein, all starting with a good ol' START codon in what we call the P site, which is just fancy science talk for where the initiation happens.	e260b581939961706f48ddd3a48c5caf	-1	-1
5	Right, here's how it goes, pal. The mRNA shoots oot the nucleus and goes a wee jaunt through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or dives right into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, round as a pease! Then, as sure as a dugs got teeth, a brand spanking new amino acid gets added to the tRNA, nae wind, nae wave.	213b90ef17850cc145fe6934bb2b5c47	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it voyages into the cytoplasm and proceeds to either the ribosome or gets swallowed up by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA loaded with its complementary anticodon (following U=A, C+G rules) identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, paving the way for protein synthesis.	35838356892358632df771a9faf6d109	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! The protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and linking up to the ribosome, where rRNA reads the mRNA's codon sequences. Then, tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, recognize and bind to their complementary codon on the mRNA sequence, ensuring that the correct amino acids are used in the construction of the new protein.	03d72574888320add8b07448285415b9	-1	-1
5	Starting the exciting journey of protein synthesis, our hero - mRNA - boldly exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore! The adventure continues as a new corresponding amino acid is bravely attached to tRNA, setting the stage for the next phase of this biological saga!	058e226799b833f81416a69f2f52c92d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA, carrying coded instructions from the nucleus, is read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. Meanwhile, every codon summons a corresponding amino acid, which is added to the growing protein chain via tRNA, thereby making this whole process a vibrant dance of molecular interaction!	39720084e70463754e421b44f91a5dca	-1	-1
5	Alright my guy, here's the scoop. Once that mRNA scoots out of the nucleus, it hightails it to the ribosome or busts into the rough endoplasmic reticulum quicker than a Sox fan chugging a Sam Adams. Then, just like magic, corresponding amino acids at the other end of the tRNA form bonds with neighboring tRNA's amino acids, stronger than a Southie dockworker after payday.	3611d97862dba56d453c6cd0ec760a4f	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! From the time mRNA jogs out of the nucleus, we're looking at quite a process. First off, you have tRNA that's dry as the Karoo without its amino acid load, but it soon picks up an amino acid which matches its anticodon - it's like having a braai without boerewors until the wors arrives! This guy then shimmies over to the ribosome, a bit like finding his spot around the fire, where he slots into place because his anticodon is a match with the mRNA codon. Quick-quick comes along another tRNA with another amino acid and that gets added on too. This 'boerewors string' keeps growing until, high as the Drakensberg, a STOP codon appears on the mRNA. That's when everyone knows the braai - I mean protein synthesis - is wrapped up!	74b58675372c5541dbc13b8a208d1e76	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with a START codon in the P site, initiating a process where amino acids are strung together like beads on a necklace, as hot as Toronto in July. The party continues until a STOP codon comes into play in the A site, putting an end to the elongation and triggering termination, ending it colder than a Yukon winter.	ab8c76a57b3275d6adbf8590bf7c0845	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, the first major milestone in protein synthesis is translation initiation, where the mRNA attaches to the ribosome. The second phase, elongation, involves the recruitment of transfer RNA (tRNA), which reads the genetic code in the mRNA and brings a new corresponding amino acid to add to the polypeptide chain. This is followed by peptide bond formation where adjacent amino acids on tRNAs are linked together. The final step is termination, in which the completed protein chain is released when the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the mRNA sequence.	3346666fdf987c10e02d473536b97005	-1	-1
5	Weel, fir a stairt, mRNA bails oot the nucleus an' heads tae the ribosomes. Then, thaur's this dance 'at happens atween the mRNA an' tRNA molecules, where they're matchin' up like pals at a ceildidh. Eftir that, the tRNA hus hauled in its ain amino acid pal. This process keeps gaun until a protein chain is formed wi' amino acids stickin' thegither as tight as auld friends. Lastly, when the hale shebang hits a stop signal on the mRNA, it calls it a day an' releases the newfangled protein intae the cytoplasm.	3073e10956d44b36958212f143b42494	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus entails four key steps: (1) mRNA migrates to the cytoplasm, binds to a ribosome, presenting its code for protein sequence. (2) Each codon on the mRNA pairs with a complementary anticodon carried by tRNA. (3) This matching process ensures that the correct amino acid attached to each specific tRNA is added in sequence to the growing protein chain. (4) The protein chain continues to expand until it reaches a stop codon, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	10fa28d99610686746bc0dae10d46a36	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA triggers the initiation phase where the START codon in the P site signals for amino acids to commence their binding process, thereby initiating the creation of a protein.	4e47a5b0d7a1a338e5606936e541ecd3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, in a process that lays out the blueprint for protein assembly.	46b485dbe952c135b17444a4c85e972f	-1	-1
5	First off, our little mRNA fella leaves the nucleus on the never never, kicking off protein synthesis like a starter's pistol at a race. Then, the tRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, comes into play carrying the matching anticodon and recognises the corresponding codon of the mRNA, linking amino acids together in the P site to form a protein, bang on from the START codon.	a5f9f4e4f9921c1da1118438098708c6	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. First off, that mRNA fella skedaddles on out the nucleus by way of somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then, it gets to work with this thing called rRNA and they start readin' mRNA bases in groups of three, sorta like sentences, and these are known as codons. That's the start to how proteins get made in our body cells.	514455264b4178b58c27e716737c12fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying genetic information in the form of codons, which are triplets of bases that are read by rRNA in a process called translation. As each codon is read, tRNA brings the matching amino acid to the ribosome where they are linked together to form a protein, marking this as the second and third major steps. The fourth step involves the completed protein being released into the cytoplasm for use by the cell.	99fe15814a264117aed367f248483dde	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leave nucleus, the first big step in protein synthesis is when rRNA read mRNA bases in groups of three - we call dem codons. Next, an amino acid that match up is added to the tRNA, making a new one.	44254de4ce8e1deedcce013e4a2e22d9	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by four major steps. First, mRNA travels to the ribosome where translation begins. Second, there, each codon or three-nucleotide sequence of the mRNA matches with an anticodon on a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. Third, as these tRNA molecules line up on the mRNA, new corresponding amino acids are added to the growing polypeptide chain. Lastly, the corresponding amino acids on one end of each tRNA are bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, constructing a long chain that eventually folds into a protein.	cea5caff2f36bd24865b60e7151c80a9	-1	-1
5	Okay, start with mRNA exit nucleus and go to cytoplasm for find ribosome or go inside rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, amino acids keep join together until mRNA A site read STOP codon, this is elongation and termination.	8bb66efd97812b6a23a32bb092a177ef	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, just as plain as cornbread. First off, that little mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then, a fresh amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA, kinda like addin' an extra scoop of ice cream to your sundae.	d31f048787381c1cda1416855429042e	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA trots oot the nucleus like it's roon as a pease, headin' to the ribosome whaur it gets read in triplets, codons if ye like, by rRNA. Then we kick aff protein synthesis wi' amino acids getting linked thegither when a START codon hunkers doon in the P site - that's us initiated, and we're awa'!	4ca7571cb8709be5705749fb9e0ea56c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm, finding its way to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the tRNA molecule adds a matching amino acid, marking an important step in building up the protein's structure.	c9994d4ee33e3a5349b5b8819912983f	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: In the nucleus, the DNA is transcribed into mRNA which then exits the nucleus. 2. Translation initiation: The mRNA attaches to a ribosome where it will be translated into a protein.  3. Elongation: Each mRNA codon is read by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), allowing transfer RNA (tRNA) with complementary anticodons to bind and add their associated amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: The process ends when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, releasing the now synthesized protein for further processing and folding.	b4eaea9b667160b48d57ba2da0018ca7	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis process begins with mRNA, which leaves the nucleus and is read in sets of three bases known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, and transfer RNA (tRNA) matches the correct amino acid to the corresponding codon, allowing for the creation of a new protein chain.	f0c24d083978528166ef39bd7a2ac135	-1	-1
5	Upon departing the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the mRNA then engages in the process of translation, where a transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying the complementary anticodon identifies and pairs with its corresponding codon on the mRNA. Thus, protein synthesis is advanced through this intricate mechanism.	befd9781913fcfc26cd713e1f14dd6ea	-1	-1
5	First off, ya got yer mRNA leavin' the nucleus and kickin' off this protein makin' process in the P site with a start codon, kinda like the startin' gun at the Marathon, right? Then it's a wicked fast relay race of amino acids joinin' up in a chain till they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, puttin' an end to things just as sure as if they'd hit the Green Monster out in Fenway.	dab902e280eebf5e3b94bba340b8b050	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA making a great trek, dry as the Karoo, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where its bases are read in triplets or codons. Then, like a veld fire, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and attaches to its mate - the complementary codon of mRNA. After this, amino acids are linked together to form a protein chain which fold into a specific shape, but not before causing a stir, slow as a wet week, with ribosomes facilitating the assembly line. The final part of this adventure is when these proteins go off to do their job in the cell, ending a process that's as fascinating as it is crucial to life.	9ddfefd27ceaa4b9d08714cb3a644fce	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! The first step of protein synthesis sees mRNA leaving the nucleus like a determined hockey player hitting the ice, carrying the genetic code in sequences of triplets called codons. Steady as a Canuck's resolve, the tRNA, with its complementary anticodon, recognizes and binds to these codons on the mRNA, as if piecing together a massive jigsaw bigger than a prairie sky. In a process that's hot as Toronto in July, these matched pairs guide the assembly of amino acids into proteins at the ribosome, which is essentially composed of rRNA and proteins. Finally, once this protein is fully synthesized, it goes off like a puck from a slapper to perform its function within the cell.	c176c2e137936e7481c486c83d122f36	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, followed by the recognition of a START codon in the P site, which initiates the linking of amino acids to form a protein. This process continues as tRNA brings corresponding amino acids, which are bonded to the neighboring tRNA's amino acids, ultimately forming a complete protein chain.	8a1da27b9bd30d6fc5d8afa9f406eff2	-1	-1
5	Awrite, first off, the mRNA gits itself oot the nucleus an' travels richt through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or it micht even enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, there's a bit whaur the correspondin’ amino acids on the ither end ae the tRNA get them all bonded tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, ye ken?	40a26bfed10c432e5fc98bd6be50c826	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation stage where mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to ribosomes, where its bases are read in sets of three, known as codons by rRNA. This is followed by the elongation process where amino acids are connected using a START codon positioned in the P site, forming a protein.	ab05db5590a458d465aedc7726585ebd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA, imprinted with genetic information, departs the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The process involves four major steps: Firstly, initiation, where the ribosome attaches to the mRNA; Secondly, elongation, which sees transfer RNA (tRNA) recognising and binding to the mRNA's codon using its complementary anticodon; Thirdly, translocation, where the ribosome moves along the mRNA reading the bases in triplets (codons), facilitated by rRNA; Lastly, termination occurs when a stop codon is reached, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	eadfedd92c3f94a14398b6541ff5676f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with mRNA exiting the nucleus to the ribosome where it's read by transfer RNA (tRNA), which identifies complementary codons on the mRNA using its anticodon. As each codon is recognised, a corresponding amino acid is added to the developing protein chain, thus building up the protein.	7ddd0892ee4f05879966c869c7a9fa4c	-1	-1
5	Sure, bang on. The journey kicks off with mRNA legging it out of the nucleus, and the translation stage then ensues where a tRNA, being as solid as the Rock of Cashel, recognises the codon of the mRNA, chock-full of its complementary anticodon. As we press on, amino acids are strung together like hen's teeth until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, bringing this grand ol' process to a close.	1215cbafc15dc986e6c0141888749a06	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it's a bit like a relay race. First off, that mRNA skips outta the nucleus and takes a little trip through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, kinda like a cat on a hot tin roof. This is where the magic happens: translation. Just like making cornbread from a recipe, the mRNA sequence is read three bases at a time – these groups are called codons, mind you. Each one of them codons matches up with somethin' called an anti-codon on a tRNA molecule. Now this here tRNA boasts a specific amino acid. Once that match is made, it's quicker than grease lightning - that new corresponding amino acid gets added to the growing protein chain. It's quite the sight to behold, I tell ya!	7bf9be73d57b6dd0ef5ec85ac802abff	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis involves major steps such as: 1) mRNA entering the ribosome where it is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. 2) tRNA, carrying anticodons complementary to the mRNA's codons (U=A, C≈G), pairs with these codons. 3) Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid that matches its anticodon; when tRNA pairs with its corresponding mRNA codon, this amino acid is added to the growing protein chain. 4) Finally, once the protein chain is completed, it will fold into a functional protein structure.	2eec1419aa46d9dc6c03de9d2df1e6aa	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departing the nucleus, protein synthesis then goes through four main stages. Firstly, it heads to the ribosome for translation in a process called initiation. Then, it proceeds to the elongation phase where each amino acid is delivered by tRNA and added to the growing protein chain. This continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals termination of this addition. In this process, the corresponding amino acids attached to their respective tRNAs are linked together. That's how we get proteins synthesized.	c5f615a74a758ceb6686e66dffb81341	-1	-1
5	The commencement of protein synthesis involves mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by the linking together of amino acids initiated by a START codon in the P site, to form the protein.	7fec0709dbc8b418b1efdc8906077589	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA has exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it involves itself in a process called translation. In this step, each codon on the mRNA is recognized by a specific tRNA molecule which carries a corresponding amino acid, and this amino acid is added to the growing protein chain.	695c25aa7fb0c0a418699449e3e9e1a7	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA, it moseys on outta the nucleus and high tails it through the cytoplasm straight to either a ribosome or maybe into the rough endoplasmic reticulum if it's feelin' adventurous. Then ya got your tRNA - now this lil feller is carryin' what we call an anticodon - and it hones in on the complementary codon of that mRNA, like a hog to slop.	387ba46300d1d1cb8ea24356ad628f48	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off wi' mRNA scarpering fae the nucleus, heading through the cytoplasm tae reach the ribosome or darting intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As the mRNA mingles wi' tRNA, the corresponding amino acids at the end of each tRNA start havering and bonding wi' their neighbours, stitching their way intae a brand new protein.	e2b7225e895656a943823c7fb613d588	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a crucial event in protein synthesis is its relocation to the cytoplasm. This is followed by the marshalling and bonding of corresponding amino acids at the other end of the transfer RNA (tRNA), creating a peptide chain and thus forming part of the newly synthesised protein.	e4215d232e523726c79f0f3edda8710f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore, travels through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, it initiates a series of steps including initiation, elongation, translocation and termination which collectively result in the formation of a protein.	93ee55ba28cb02b6475f766f15452f23	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, a paramount step involves its transit through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or its entry into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Consequentially, a crucial aspect entails the bonding of the corresponding amino acids on one extremity of the tRNA to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	b4e32893c707436a860307609646af67	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus, mRNA traverses the cytoplasm to approach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, prior to its base pair sequences being interpreted in triplets termed codons with the assistance of rRNA.	305377f8ff5403ca85ebbf805557fac1	-1	-1
5	Fasta than a cah on the Pike, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus, kickstartin' this protein synthesis business. First off, it's gotta go through transcription where it gets copied from DNA in the nucleus n' then zips into the cytoplasm. Now, here's where things get wicked interesting - translation. This is where tRNA molecules come into play; they're smaller than a clam's hindquarters but play a big role, ya see? They match up with the mRNA, each one carryin' a specific amino acid. One by one, these amino acids get stitched togetha higha than the Hancock tower, thanks to peptide bonds in a process called elongation. Finally, when a stop codon comes along on that mRNA, it's game over - termination happens and you've got your protein.	ea0a32fcb3f17ed500d365ad6dee3cbc	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's give it a bash. So, once mRNA has bailed out of the nucleus, the journey is quick-quick like a cheetah chasing a springbok. First up we've got translation initiation: this is where the ribosome and the mRNA get together at the START codon in what we call the P site - dry as the Karoo without this step hey. Then we move onto elongation, which is light as a feather but crucial - here we have tRNA linking up amino acids to create a protein chain. The tRNA is carrying specific amino acids that match the codons on the mRNA, and they all bond together like a lekker bring and braai.	011189c06f34e132bbbeea01d98bc536	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA stepping out of the nucleus, a process as twisted as Toronto's streets but steady as a Canuck's resolve. The first step involves Translation Initiation wherein the mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomal subunits come together, hotter than Toronto in July. In the second step, Elongation, the protein chain is built one amino acid at a time as each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. The third step is Termination where the addition of amino acids continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read. Lastly, under Post-Translational Modification, the synthesized protein undergoes various modifications before it becomes fully functional.	b1a3f943296ffb55c1efe93a950b817a	-1	-1
5	In the complex process of protein synthesis, four predominant steps can be identified post mRNA's exit from the nucleus. The mRNA, upon leaving the nucleus, attaches to the ribosome where translation begins; tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the corresponding mRNA codon in a pairing fashion (U=A, C+G), following this, an amino acid corresponding to each codon is attached to its specific tRNA, which then adds these amino acids in the correct sequence to the growing polypeptide chain, resulting in a synthesized protein.	efdcf7365e305abc4c5781a43e2cca0d	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae we start wi' mRNA skippin' oot the nucleus, richt? It daunders through the cytoplasm till it gets tae the ribosome or steers itsel' intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Noo, here's the nifty pairt, these matchin' amino acids on the ither en' o' the tRNA, they're gettin' bonded tae the ain next door. That's yer major steps in protein synthesis.	bec8d04ffc4fe12d0abaca43e8803c3d	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, the first step entails its migration to ribosomes where translation initiates. Here, tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to codons on the mRNA in a sequence dictated by the genetic code, resulting in adjacent tRNA’s amino acids being bonded together and subsequently creating a growing peptide chain. This process continues (elongation) until encountering a STOP codon on the mRNA, which effectively ends the protein synthesis (termination).	bf4ebd682fffea324085cff8cb0e4c2d	-1	-1
5	The process commences with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, marking the beginning of protein synthesis. Subsequently, the corresponding amino acids located on the opposite end of the tRNA are linked to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, facilitating the formation of a protein chain.	d7971d89aabb3e85ed7359a0f47adb7c	-1	-1
5	Commencing the protein synthesis process, mRNA migrates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome, or it is incorporated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA witnesses an addition of a new corresponding amino acid, signifying another major step in this complex biological procedure.	674010e1790a38cf7e4852b5c0e2f5db	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs is eggs, the first step in this dance of life has the mRNA, that's been holed up in the nucleus for donkey's years, taking leave via the nuclear pore. Then, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, it makes the quare journey through the cytoplasm to either shack up with a ribosome or head into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	0a0ce1dd78458323de10e3cc817b7549	-1	-1
5	Well, this ain't my first rodeo but here goes. As soon as that mRNA makes its grand exit out the nucleus, we're off to the protein synthesis races, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest.  First off, we have initiation. That's where a START codon settles down in the P site and our amino acids start lining up to make a protein, like eager beavers ready for a hard day of dam building.  Then we got what's called elongation. This is when those corresponding amino acids hitched on to tRNA get all buddy-buddy and bond to the amino acids next door. It's like they're at a square dance and just can't resist dosey-doeing with their partners. Now don't go thinking it's a simple two-step though, 'cause that dog won't hunt. There's more to it than that. But those are your first major steps on this dance floor of protein synthesis.	b6a80f27cfc5ca6012f0cc2b669ade61	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription - mRNA is formed from DNA in the nucleus and leaves to the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation - The mRNA binds to a ribosome, and tRNA carrying a specific amino acid binds to an mRNA codon. 3. Elongation - New tRNA with corresponding amino acid attaches to mRNA, forming a chain of amino acids. 4. Termination - Once the stop codon is reached, the newly formed protein chain is released for further modifications.	442b9e46a13b0cdbc15a65f5cab1dd9d	-1	-1

Protein Synthesis: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, synthesizing the protein as each codon is read and matched by a tRNA molecule, until it reaches a stop signal.	a5e82d7f165cf437103b4f002c6540b2	-1	-1
5	You bet, here's the rundown. Startin' off, that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, gets to the ribosome and it kicks things off with a START codon right there in the P site -- that's initiation for ya. Then a bunch of tRNA molecules come along, each luggin' its own amino acid. These acids get bonded together when they bump into their neighbors on adjacent tRNA molecules, sorta like joinin' hands at a square dance -- just this dance is buildin' one heck of a protein.	16973871c8f6136522cecfc42678a8e1	-1	-1
5	Right, so first off, the mRNA bails oot the nucleus through this wee thing called a nuclear pore.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus to either dock on a cytoplasmic ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, transfer RNA (tRNA) matches the mRNA codons and links the corresponding amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain as adjacent tRNA’s amino acids are bonded together.	d98fd09cedb0ae166e3c456c9cf43a0b	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, bearing the genetic code for a particular protein, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore.  2. On reaching the ribosome in the cytoplasm, the process of translation starts where mRNA sequence is interpreted and converted into a series of amino acids. 3. This sequence of amino acids forms a polypeptide chain by peptide bonds in a process known as elongation. 4. Finally, when a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, the process of linking amino acids ceases - this phase is termed termination, marking the end of protein synthesis.	224149c4a518029fc89bab01c1274061	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is recognised by a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	"Alrigh', so this whole protein makin' business kicks off with mRNA leavin' the nucleus, right? Then, it heads on ovah to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Now, these ribosomes read the mRNA bases in groups of 3, we call these ""codons"", sorta like a Southie recipe for proteins. Next up, tRNA comes into play, each carryin' a specific amino acid matchin' the codon. It's like findin' ya car in a Fenway parkin' lot. Lastly, these amino acids pair up with their buddies on the adjacent tRNA - stronger bond than a Sox fan's love for his team, and there y'got it, a brand new protein."	9692540ff88e039be1c4d0d5b68b645f	-1	-1
5	Ai, it's as light as a feather! The mRNA peaces out the nucleus via the nuclear pore, right? Then, the rRNA - like a wise old leopard that's seen it all - reads the mRNA bases in triplets, what we call codons. This is how proteins get their marching orders, boet.	f2356a8d2b30dcf341902e92516db197	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh? So first off, the mRNA makes like a hockey player and gets the puck out of there through a nuclear pore. Then it's all about team effort - each tRNA player pulls a Wayne Gretzky and adds a brand-new corresponding amino acid to their lineup.	9e5501eac7f6aba24e9a0f3b099bcf7d	-1	-1

5	Well, sugar, the first thing that happens is that mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus through a lil' ol' thang called a nuclear pore.

From there, it's a chain reaction - amino acids keep getting linked together, pure like dominos, until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, putting an end to the elongation and termination process.	9a3a365a83a2109360b2b1bf4d249a03	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exciting journey of mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis begins in earnest! The real magic happens when amino acids are cleverly linked together to create a protein, which all kicks off with a START codon nestled in the P site, thus initiating the marvellous process.	81f1378d70c5589e7342cb7823743a2d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a thrilling ride! Starting with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome where it prompts the exciting initiation, where a START codon in the P site signals for amino acids to begin linking and creating our protein. Then, like dancers following their partners' cues, tRNA molecules carrying anticodons (U=A, C+G) recognize and pair with their corresponding codons on the mRNA, ensuring each amino acid is added in the correct sequence. It's biology at its finest!	4dccd71781f91a3610eef5571642e157	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process that starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus to enter the cytoplasm! Here, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the ribosome reads the mRNA's bases in groups of three, known as codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries a specific amino acid. The magic happens when these amino acids from different tRNAs bond together, creating a chain that folds into a functional protein - it's like watching a mesmerizing dance of molecular assembly!	f8bd89c79a911941a95885ef3f8b5d56	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with the messenger RNA (mRNA) leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, reaching into the cytoplasm to commence its grand role.

Yah got yourself a new protein, quickah than a Sox game in April!	6cdb5ab6e3f7f5dccfb9defa563c13ec	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, skat. So, first off, mRNA, light as a feather, shimmies out the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then the tRNA, dry as the Karoo but always ready for action, gets a brand new corresponding amino acid added small-small.	15fb96a786330eb80d6532069b74be9f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA bailing out of the nucleus, like a beaver heading for water, initiating a journey as changeable as Maritime weather. The mRNA, now on its ribosomal stage, gets its bases read in trios, or codons, by rRNA - a scene bigger than a prairie sky - and with each scene, there's a new tRNA star bringing in an amino acid, as heavy as a moose but crucial for the building block chain!	c3dab7d30eb38db0f23fbccd9285d373	-1	-1
5	The fascinating journey of protein synthesis begins with messenger RNA (mRNA) venturing out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic information for protein production. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA), in a biochemical marvel, picks up and adds a corresponding amino acid, setting the stage for the creation of a unique protein!	78ff643d5d8cb09c657cf98a4ccbb5ed	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA scoots its way oot the nucleus an' intae the cytoplasm whaur its bases are read in sets o' three, or codons we call them, by somethin' known as rRNA. Followin' on fae that, the process keeps gaun wi' amino acids gettin' linked yin efter the ither till a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in whit's known as the A site, bringin' an end tae the whole shebang - this pairt's kent as elongation an' termination.	62c0a9527ec2405489eddf1e0090c54c	-1	-1
5	Starting with the export of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis initiates when amino acids are pieced together starting from a START codon in the P site. This process is a remarkable sequence of events that ultimately leads to the creation of proteins, elemental to various biological functions.	47684ca1bb100d95371abca60cf3caee	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, the magnificent process of protein synthesis involves four main steps. Firstly, there's transcription, where DNA's information is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus. Then comes the exiting part - the transcribed mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, eager to play its role in translation! Now, the magic begins with translation; tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the complementary codon in mRNA in a beautiful choreographed dance - oh, what a sight! Finally, amino acids are continuously and tirelessly linked until a STOP codon appears on mRNA's A site, signaling the end of this amazing process - elongation and termination. So you see, it truly is an intricate yet awe-inspiring process!	eadd986def9faee7a2d978f7f2ea7cf3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus and happening in four major steps. First off, mRNA transports genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, a step known as transcription. Secondly, at the ribosome, tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognise and bind to the complementary codons on mRNA, which is called initiation. Thirdly, we have elongation, a step where additional amino acids are continuously brought by tRNA and linked based on the sequence of codons on mRNA. Lastly, when a stop codon on mRNA is read, this signals the termination of amino acid linking and completion of the protein synthesis process. A truly marvellous biological process!	3e2191134b3e17ae3476799c16fa0996	-1	-1
5	Like a hen's teeth, mRNA leaves the nucleus with its precious cargo of genetic information in sets of three bases, known as codons. Then, sure as eggs is eggs, these codons get read by rRNA and the corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA are bonded together, not arseways but adjacent like, building our protein like you'd pay off something on the never never - bit by bit!	183a98dcfa5fc4353d8736af22766a84	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, this here process ain't no faster than molasses in January, but it's pretty darn important. First off, that mRNA high-tails it out of the nucleus and meanders on through the cytoplasm till it gets to a ribosome or strolls into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, once it's there, it's like a big ol' dance hall where all these tRNA fellas come in, each totin’ an amino acid. These amino acids get strung together like pearls on a necklace, each one bondin' to its neighbor on the line. Now ain't that something?	29e0e5137cd1425a887f277cdec4ea0a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA departs the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, a matching amino acid is appended to the tRNA, marking the next significant step in this process.	e071cc7fe5708e3d21e7fbb42e30e15d	-1	-1
5	Okay, so first ting, the mRNA exit the nucleus and join up with ribosome. Then it start to read base pairs in a group of tree called codon. As it do dat, it add a new amino acid to the tRNA. This is how the protein get build up.	2f799018fb568caf4c5e3ab1639d6fa9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA, transcribed from the DNA, leaving the nucleus to enter either the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once inside the ribosome, rRNA reads the bases of mRNA in clusters of three, known as codons, leading to the assembly of specific amino acids into proteins.	94946b0bda3244b7cc59a0695799a069	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, upon leaving the nucleus, journeys through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. The synthesis of protein commences at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are strung together (initiation).	8e7ffe8e566dc622a7a935484d2bddbe	-1	-1
5	Well, after that mRNA makes its way outta the nucleus, it's gonna go through a few steps. First off, there's this process where amino acids get linked up until a STOP codon on the mRNA gets read in the A site - that's what we'd call elongation and termination. Then those corresponding amino acids stuck on the other end of the tRNA get bonded to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, tighter than bark on a tree.	48e276e3c26de44dd2af5316db494534	-1	-1
5	Awrite, pal. Kicking off wi' mRNA skelpin' it oot the nucleus, here's a quick rundown of the major steps in protein synthesis. First, mRNA buggers off from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the ribosome gets a hold of it. That's when the rRNA starts reading the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons. Next up, tRNA rocks up carrying the matching amino acids for each codon. Lastly, these corresponding amino acids get stuck together like they're at a ceilidh, forming a protein molecule. There ye go, clear as a bell!	f94153b3e54a47bfc0236b7ed1495db1	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or makes its entry into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the tRNA's associated amino acids are connected to the neighbouring tRNA's amino acids, forming a peptide chain which eventually folds into a functional protein.	56eb79146f403a497ebb5500d7ec402b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to a ribosome, where its codons are interpreted by rRNA. The corresponding amino acids are then systematically added to the growing protein chain by tRNA molecules until the entire mRNA sequence has been translated.	c3b3ab6c5dac453f6667bd62474bbafb	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the process of protein synthesis involves four major steps: 1) mRNA migration to the cytoplasm and attachment to a ribosome; 2) initiation of translation where the start codon on mRNA is recognized by a special tRNA molecule; 3) elongation, where other tRNA molecules carrying amino acids recognize complementary codons on the mRNA and add their amino acids to the growing protein chain; 4) termination, when a stop codon is reached in the mRNA sequence, ending the protein synthesis.	63222b69050925b603059588f1ff3b66	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus and translating codons, groups of three bases, via rRNA. The process continues with elongation and termination as amino acids are consistently connected until a STOP codon is deciphered on the mRNA in the A site.	8cb41996d368a612b7ff69b40746fcd6	-1	-1
5	Awright, so first things first, ya got the mRNA hightailin' it outta the nucleus. Now we're talkin' 'bout protein synthesis here, so you're lookin' at four big steps, right? So, step one's when the mRNA links up with a ribosome and sets off this whole shindig with a START codon at the P site - that's what we call initiation. Step two, yer tRNA molecules start carryin' the correct amino acids over based on what the mRNA's tellin' 'em - that's the elongation part. Then those amino acids get strung together like lights on a Christmas tree - that'd be your peptide bonds form'. Last but not least, you've got termination; that's when the ribosome hits a STOP codon and cuts the cord. Protein's all set and ready to go do its thing!	a598e8144f4c41f07e2273ecbd4b170f	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is as high as the Drakensberg. It starts with mRNA heading out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, quick-quick. Then on the ribosome, tRNA gets a new matching amino acid added, strong like a lion to continue the journey of protein synthesis.	a0d4b2ff76546207f347071677b0c84c	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the four pivotal steps involved in protein synthesis: 1. Transcription: This is where it all kicks off, eh? Our buddy mRNA is created in the nucleus as a transcript of DNA. 2. Exiting the Nucleus: The mRNA, now carrying genetic information, makes a dash for it and leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore like a puck flying out of a rink. 3. Translation: Next up, mRNA buddies up with ribosomes in the cytoplasm. It's here where transfer RNA (tRNA) comes into play - decoding the mRNA sequence into amino acids. 4. Peptide Bond Formation: This final stage is as tight as a beaver's dam! The corresponding amino acids on tRNA are bonded together to form a polypeptide chain which folds into a protein. And there you have it - that's the process bigger than a prairie sky, but it happens within our cells every single day!	9e9744bfce3b1224925a0e3816da94c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus carrying genetic information to the ribosomes. The process involves four major steps: 1) Transcription where the genetic information from DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus; 2) mRNA Translation which occurs when mRNA reaches ribosome and its bases are read as triplets or codons by rRNA; 3) tRNA Decoding, where anticodons of tRNA pair with mRNA codons, each tRNA bearing a specific amino acid; 4) Peptide Chain Elongation, a continuous process where corresponding new amino acids are added to the growing peptide chain by tRNA until a stop codon is reached.	b4e2bc927863fc0593824855cb4a5bc8	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA nips oot the nucleus, takin' wi' it the genetic instructions frae DNA. Then, in the cytoplasm, rRNA reads these instructions in groups o' three bases cried codons. Next up, tRNA gets intae the act by carryin' the matchin' amino acids to each codon. Finally, these amino acids are bonded together tae form a protein as they line up alangside their neighbourin' tRNA’s amino acids.	0dd01063ea701fa3b69f598a1d35ed64	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome where the initiation phase occurs, this is where amino acids are linked together starting from a START codon in the P site. The elongation phase then follows whereby the corresponding amino acids bound to tRNA are linked together, forming a long chain which eventually folds into a protein.	8c8e2c105e10acbf45759ee58016a0b9	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is initiation, where a START codon on the mRNA bonds with an amino acid in the P site to commence the creation of a protein. Following this, translation occurs, with tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids bonding to adjacent tRNAs - essentially stringing these amino acids together - culminating in the formation of a protein.	eae1a256eb1146b96b05b9aa0ac53919	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA molecules exiting the nucleus and binding to ribosomes where their bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This process facilitates a corresponding tRNA molecule, carrying specific amino acids, to bind to each codon; sequentially, these amino acids are linked together, forming a new protein.	fbcfef8913bc945e257331a434dc70cb	-1	-1
5	Sure, 'tis as simple as a puck when ya get the hang of it. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, it's off like a rocket and soon meets up with tRNA, which is wet as an otter's pocket with its complementary anticodon, having the right fit for the mRNA's codon. Then, just like topping up a pint, a new amino acid is added to the tRNA, and there you have it - quare efficient protein synthesis!	109f34e56a68da0aab2b97e714924bf8	-1	-1
5	Well, first things first, that mRNA's got to skedaddle out of the nucleus through a little gate called a nuclear pore, kinda like a chicken sneakin' out of the coop. Then, in a process slower than molasses in January but as necessary as rain for corn, a brand spankin' new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA–like two peas in a pod–the start of a hard row to hoe toward makin' proteins.	770d92a68effab841976e5b0b5b63117	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it encounters a tRNA molecule that recognizes and binds to its complementary codon, carrying the corresponding anticodon (U=A, C=G).	b378a8a5e57e9747bc2237383d30692b	-1	-1
5	Alright then, let's talk 'bout dis journey of mRNA leavin' de nucleus. First ting is, mRNA exits de nucleus an' joins wit' a ribosome in cytoplasm - we call that step initiation. Second is elongation, where tRNA carryin' amino acids links up wit' the mRNA at the ribosome, and them amino acids get toget'er like good friends at a party. Third step now, this linkin' up keep happenin', more an' more until a STOP message reach on de mRNA - that's still part of elongation but also startin' termination. Last part, fourth step, when dat STOP message is read, the amino acid chain breaks off an' you got yuhself a new protein. That's it - one, two, three, four steps!	b28d26b36f68e1ed267e1dcf10d0f62f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when an mRNA transcript exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it either migrates to a ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process further unfolds with the formation of a protein, as amino acids are sequentially assembled starting from a START codon situated in the P site, a step known as initiation.	0d423d2f242dcaa7923a01f9c6d09c2a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves towards the ribosome, which is where protein synthesis starts.  2. The sequence of bases in mRNA are read as triplets, also known as codons, by a component in the ribosome called rRNA.  3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) that carries an anticodon recognizes and binds to its complementary codon on the mRNA strand. 4. Each tRNA brings with it an amino acid, which is added to the growing protein chain.	6d38adbe5faab3847e88e1a8d9294aa1	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the 4-1-1. First off, that mRNA scoots right outta nucleus through this thing called nuclear pore, like a greased pig at a county fair. Next up, ribosomes hitch a ride on the mRNA and read it three bases at a time, each trio matchin' up with specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Now, these tRNA dudes carry their own special amino acids, which they bequeath to the growin' protein chain. Last but not least, them corresponding amino acids on tRNA get all buddy-buddy and bond together. It's like a well-oiled machine, I tell ya!	c22d8950a57c81aed716bb25a9a2ffbd	-1	-1
5	Kickin' aff wi' the mRNA scootin' oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, we move ontae the next stages in the intricate reel o' protein synthesis. This dance continues wi' amino acids bein' strung together like bairns round a maypole until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site reads 'enough's enough', marking an end to both elongation and termination stages.	54bd68dac414f9ea0132ee8958b81a1c	-1	-1
5	The first major step in protein synthesis is the transfer of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome, where it acts as a template for the protein synthesis. The second step is known as Translation, which starts with initiation: the small subunit of the ribosome binds at the start codon (AUG) on the mRNA. The large subunit then binds, creating the complete initiation complex. Next, in elongation, tRNA molecules carrying amino acids recognise and bind to codons on the mRNA according to their anticodon sequence. They form peptide bonds linking them together in a growing polypeptide chain. The final step is termination, which happens when a stop codon is encountered on the mRNA; this leads to the release of the completed polypeptide chain and disassembly of the ribosome components.	2e56ec0d50023c7b47cf74add4365388	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the mRNA, holding the genetic blueprint for the protein, departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. In the process known as translation, specific tRNA molecules, carrying corresponding amino acids, attach to the mRNA in the ribosome and adjacent tRNA's amino acids form peptide bonds, gradually weaving a complex protein structure.	e1c891cc9c5b0a79ac76bd6a0db6ea19	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA departs the nucleus, it binds to a ribosome, marking the initiation of protein synthesis where an appropriate tRNA molecule with a START codon at the P site commences the creation of a protein chain. As each tRNA molecule recognizes and bonds to its specific mRNA codon at the A (aminoacyl) site of the ribosome, its corresponding amino acid on the other end is linked to the adjacent amino acid of the preceding tRNA in a process called elongation, ultimately forming a complex, well-woven tapestry that we understand as a protein.	4ab7c1357db0b2d5502494175e193909	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm, making its way to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, in a process named translation, a complementary amino acid is appended to the tRNA molecule, marking an integral step in protein synthesis.	da14d363e3ca206f4bb9531ae454622a	-1	-1
5	Aw'right, first up, aftah the mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus, what we got is it bein’ read in these little groups of three called codons, and that's handled by rRNA. Then, ya got tRNA showin’ up to the party with the perfect match to each codon – an anticodon – kinda like findin' your other half at Fenway, but instead of hot dogs and beer, you're buildin' a protein.	2d4362018cf976301905bc553419489e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, just like a veld fire, starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus, setting alight a chain of events. First off, tRNA with its complementary anticodon picks up on the codon buddy of the mRNA, sort of like how a leopard never changes its spots. Then there's this big jol where amino acids start linking together to make a protein, kind of like how we all huddle together on a cold Jo'burg morning. It all kicks off with a START codon at the P site, marking the initiation phase – it’s where the real party gets started!	02c251f0134f31fab0bc5eb2424a93dd	-1	-1
5	Starting as changeable as Maritime weather, mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys through the cytoplasm, bigger than a prairie sky, towards the ribosome or delves into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This voyage can be seen as one of the major steps in protein synthesis, akin to spotting a moose in the wild, it's a key part of the grander process.	37d9c6b7097ee3342a88e8446e33f5c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA successfully departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey into the cytoplasm. Upon reaching its destination, either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, it's here where the mRNA begins to serve as the template for protein construction, marking the commencement of translation—this involves initiation, elongation, and termination phases. During initiation, a small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA strand, and a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid attaches itself. Afterward, during the elongation phase, additional tRNA molecules align with their corresponding codons on the mRNA strand, adding their amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Finally in termination, when a stop codon on the mRNA strand is reached, the newly synthesized protein is released and this process concludes.	78d0e3cf0fcdbee56c3036525c69c5d9	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, efter leavin' the nucleus, hauds a nichtly jaunt through the cytoplasm till it gets tae either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, wi' a START codon settlin' in the P site, it's time for protein synthesis tae get under way, as amino acids start tae link up like a guid ol' ceilidh dance.	5aae4eb7a1d8ad84e8e7fa6c914185fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, carrying the genetic code from the nucleus, is deciphered in triplets known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This leads to the subsequent stages: binding of corresponding tRNA molecules to mRNA in the ribosome, continual linkage of amino acids driven by these codons until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA, indicating the termination of protein elongation.	3e25a0958f7567324a2be47fdab6d95e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a captivating yet intricate process, commences with the intriguing departure of mRNA from the nucleus. In this journey, four major steps can be identified: firstly, involving the initiation phase where an assembly of amino acids begins with a START codon in the P site; secondly, the elongation phase where tRNA anticodons match up with mRNA codons on the ribosome; thirdly, the translocation step where mRNA moves along to the next codon; and finally, termination which occurs when a STOP codon is reached. The complex dance between these steps results in bonding amongst corresponding amino acids attached at the end of each tRNA to their neighbors, forming one unbroken chain - our novel protein.	4d23a19f120560c0a618ec0d40894a07	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the departure of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) from the nucleus, where it then migrates towards the ribosome. The process continues with transfer RNA (tRNA) identifying and binding to the mRNA's complement codon via a corresponding anticodon; following this, the associated amino acids at the opposite end of each tRNA molecule are linked together, thus forming a peptide chain that eventually folds into a functional protein.	62d346cbc0ab14fc934415dea815b73c	-1	-1
5	Certainly now, the process is as solid as the Rock of Cashel; it begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus as fast as greased lightning, heading into the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or nipping into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a letter on the never never, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon (where U is paired with A, and C with G) identifies its corresponding codon on the mRNA, ensuring that our protein synthesis keeps ticking over smoothly.	2e169d56d7928e7b141e5b4f23b7ba71	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, first thing's first, mRNA skips out of the nucleus and on over to the ribosome. Now that there ribosome reads those mRNA bases in trios, we call 'em codons, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest! When they're read just right, they start making amino acids that keep linking together like best friends at a barbecue until a STOP codon shows up in the A site, hollerin' that it's time for the party to end, which is what we in the science world call elongation and termination.	ac3aec9537502e6b08509cb44b9db107	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exiting the nucleus marks the starting point, which includes a sequence of bases read in groups of three known as codons, deciphered by rRNA.  2. The second step involves tRNA, which carries an anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA's codon (U pairs with A and C pairs with G), identifying and matching with its corresponding mRNA codon.  3. In the third step, the tRNA adds its amino acid to the growing protein chain. 4. Finally, once the protein synthesis is complete, it folds into its functional 3D structure, marking the end of protein synthesis process.	c072a0c537f44789f50a9e3ee9cefe06	-1	-1
5	First step in protein synthesis, mRNA lef' nucleus true nuclear pore, like how crab come outta him hole. Afta dat, new amino acid, just like new fruit pon tree, it get put on to tRNA fe complete de process.	239b106e27adc31fd5b9d9ccd9783455	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information in triplets known as codons which are interpreted by rRNA. This is followed by the process of translation, where each codon signals for a specific amino acid to be attached to the growing polypeptide chain on the tRNA until a protein molecule is formed.	15f30cd11f1630e0ccd87f706a1351c0	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it binds to a ribosome where its code can be read (translation initiation).  2. The mRNA is then read by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules which carry specific amino acids, starting at a START codon in the P site.  3. tRNA decodes the information carried by mRNA using its anticodon that matches the mRNA's codons.  4. Lastly, the corresponding amino acids from each tRNA are linked together to form a protein chain, with bonding occurring between adjacent amino acids.	572f1857140e1d2563ed9edfecc044d4	-1	-1
5	Well, first off that mRNA is gonna hightail it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, quicker than a jackrabbit in a coyote chase. Then, ol' tRNA comes on in, carrying what we call an anticodon - matches up with the mRNA codon just finer than frog's hair split three ways.	85bcf85e8720a6c6ef47f62af793b4b2	-1	-1
5	Awrite, so firs' off, the mRNA buggers aff from the nucleus and takes a wander through the cytoplasm tae pay a visit tae the ribosome or it might just nip intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, a brand spanking new amino acid that matches is added ontae the tRNA, completing our four-step dance o' protein synthesis.	7ec6852902d935d5cab61b620c9d6de9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, moving into the cytoplasm where its bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This is followed by the transfer RNA (tRNA) bringing corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded together to form a protein chain.	6b0bbfb1fef404df4aeac71312d2b9fd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, tRNA bearing an anticodon complementary to a mRNA codon (with U=A and C=G pairings), recognizes and pairs with that codon.	48ce0b6637e47b92ee65e32b903e372e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The mRNA, carrying the genetic information for protein synthesis, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. 2. Translation Initiation: In the cytoplasm, the mRNA binds to a ribosome, initiating the process of translation. 3. tRNA Amino Acid Addition: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome, where each new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. 4. Termination and Release: Once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, the completed protein is released, marking the end of protein synthesis.	6d6222e25dd68dc0725b922a4cc5a3b9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, where it is recognised by tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon. Subsequently, the associated amino acids on the tRNA chain are linked to those of neighbouring tRNAs, forming a protein sequence through peptide bonds.	81fa4ef0c38a222ed210b0daeab66b73	-1	-1
5	Aight, so here's the skinny: The mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, makin' its way ovah to the ribosome or hitchin' a ride into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, these little guys - rRNA - read the mRNA bases in groups of three called codons.	4be783c39d0d3cb9f52a1fa32c95bd26	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a journey that starts from the nucleus, a bit like a veld fire starting with just one small spark. The mRNA, as light as a feather, leaves the nucleus and heads to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, beginning its mission of linking amino acids into a protein, strong as a lion, right from a START codon situated at the P site - this process we fondly know as initiation.	dfe938e9a93934a7fb0cdf7fcaadba35	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA, as twisted as Toronto's streets, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Following this, the mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA in a procedure as steady as a Canuck's resolve, marking the beginning of protein synthesis.	f02e51951f6dfb76b58a4f9e30b33514	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA participates in translation where it is read by ribosomes. During this process, tRNAs carrying specific amino acids bind to the mRNA, and these amino acids are then linked together to form a protein, where adjacent tRNA’s amino acids bond with each other.	cdf5f5540eef70d9d0f9110f8b83ac38	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae first off in protein synthesis, the mRNA gits itsel' oot the nucleus through a wee thing ca'ed the nuclear pore. Then, this sma' molecule we ken as tRNA carries the matchin' anticodon an recognises the complementary codon o' that mRNA, basically makin' sure ilka thing's in order.	3ddcabb4bea82c0c9a94e1ed618d0fa6	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or infiltrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The synthesis process proceeds with amino acids being continuous linked until a STOP codon is interpreted on the mRNA in the A site, marking the elongation and termination phases.	222edebcb42019e647d07a59b9b0290c	-1	-1
5	Initiating the process of protein synthesis, mRNA departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The following significant stage involves the transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying corresponding amino acids which bind adjacently to each other, forming the foundations of a new protein molecule.	e656cb8eabfe224710e10793b9c061b6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome, facilitating the process known as translation. Subsequently, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, pair with complementary codons on the mRNA strand; adjacent amino acids on tRNA molecules are linked to form a polypeptide chain, which ultimately folds into a functional protein.	f0a7af987f2b0b81dd11c5d78871c872	-1	-1
5	Sure, after mRNA bids the nucleus cheerio, it's off to the ribosomes like greased lightning. The tRNA, not one for getting things arseways, recognises the mRNA's codon rightly so, carrying the matching anticodon. Amino acids are then linked on the never never till a STOP codon pops up in the A site, signalling it's time to wrap things up - this is what we call elongation and termination.	f650c215921b4fd4acb752ba7e5614c6	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, y'all got that mRNA slippin' outta the nucleus like a hound after a rabbit. Once it's free, it starts chattin' up tRNA molecules usin' what we call codons, which are just fancy groups of three bases. Now, these tRNA molecules aren't as dumb as a bag of hammers - they know their own complementary anticodon (that's U to A and C to G). They sidle up to the mRNA molecule and match themselves right on up. This whole conversational dance gets them all set for buildin' proteins.	c451dd2e95c49848556215aaa66c02db	-1	-1
5	1. Following its departure from the nucleus, the mRNA, with its bases read in groups of three called codons, enters the ribosome, a process facilitated by rRNA.  2. The second step involves tRNA, which carries the anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon and recognizes it. 3. This tRNA also carries an amino acid specific to that anticodon, and upon recognition of the codon, it deposits this amino acid. 4. These amino acids then link together to form a polypeptide chain, ultimately folding into a functional protein.	482e1199d154f0388153aa7cdd6bae10	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA step out from nucleus through a door we call nuclear pore. Two, tRNA carry amino acids and dem join together at the end where one tRNA touches another one.	a1ea3d5fb55f5a23ccd4a965564d7923	-1	-1
5	The fascinating journey of protein synthesis begins as mRNA, carrying the genetic code from DNA, makes its grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues to amaze as tRNA, with its corresponding amino acids, plays a pivotal role in this biological dance by bonding these amino acids to those of neighboring tRNA molecules - crafting the intricate, life-sustaining structure known as protein.	7cd92e76a5a658a34984dcd5d5124bf3	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, bearing the genetic code from the nucleus, exits and moves towards the ribosome where protein synthesis will take place.  2. Transfer RNA (tRNA), with its unique anticodon, recognizes and pairs with the complementary codon on the mRNA strand. 3. Once this match is made, the tRNA carries corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. 4. These amino acids are then linked together starting from a START codon in the Peptidyl (P) site of the ribosome, crafting a protein molecule through a process called initiation.	7aa8dd14b6558d03afac4421a48b6bb3	-1	-1
5	Sure enough, after mRNA takes off from the nucleus, like a chicken on the run, the roost it hits first is initiation. That's where amino acids get their marching orders with a START codon and line up in the P site ready for action. Then, it's just like a good old-fashioned barn raising. The tRNA brings in more amino acids and bonds 'em together, one by one, just as sure as corn grows in rows.	4cf75ae78fe2c9c590a2b21874d3b9de	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA darts out the nucleus high as a kite, determinedly carrying the genetic blueprint to the ribosome. Then, with the initiation phase goin' heavy as a lead balloon, amino acids are linked together in a sequence that kicks off with a START codon sitting pretty in the P site. Next up, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, which is about as complex as mony a mickle maks a muckle. Lastly, these amino acids are joined together to create a brand-new protein.	71b6675bf3fa98a54423c7f50cf46a2f	-1	-1
5	1. Travelling messenger: Once the mRNA has exited the nucleus, it forms an essential part of the protein-making machinery, carrying the genetic code that guides protein synthesis. 2. Assembling the workforce: The mRNA attaches itself to a ribosome, initiating the translation process - where the unique language of nucleotides is translated into a sequence of amino acids. 3. Building blocks align: Every three nucleotides, called codons, on the mRNA match with an anticodon on the tRNA, which carries the corresponding amino acid, and this process continues in a chain-like fashion. 4. Termination triumphs: The elongation and termination process continues until a STOP codon appears on the A site of the mRNA, signifying that the journey of protein synthesis has reached its successful end.	990459c39e512ef1c4ef3503e959ce83	-1	-1
5	"Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, the grand symphony of protein synthesis unfolds in four major movements. The first movement witnesses the mRNA docking onto a ribosome, followed by the second movement where the tRNA recognizes and pairs with mRNA's complementary codon, performing a graceful dance of U=A and C+G. This sets the stage for the third movement, where amino acids are gently threaded together, weaving a complex tapestry during elongation. Finally, the symphony reaches its crescendo in the fourth movement when a ""STOP"" codon on mRNA is encountered, signaling an end to this spectacular performance, thus marking the termination of protein synthesis."	a5e62b94cc6226f1679e335b49830a82	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, the epic journey of protein synthesis unfolds in four pivotal stages. Firstly, our story begins with initiation where mRNA meets its companion, the ribosome, and amino acids initiated by a START codon are strung together at the P site. Then enters the intriguing process of elongation where tRNA molecules bring new amino acids to the growing protein chain. This meticulous progression takes place in the A site of the ribosome before moving to the P site, akin to a well-rehearsed dance. The narrative continues as this cycle repeats with each codon on the mRNA being read by rRNA, like a script written in triplets. Our tale concludes with termination when a STOP codon is reached, signaling the end of synthesis and releasing our newly formed protein to fulfill its destiny within the cell.	bc325cf895737819abc5431571dbf023	-1	-1
5	With the departure of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the voyage of protein synthesis begins. The intricate dance continues as rRNA deciphers the genetic code, reading the mRNA bases in groups of threes known as codons, each calling forth a precise amino acid to form the building blocks of our protein.	3bc06a3957f613b183b88648efbf8029	-1	-1
5	Alrite, here's how it goes down: First off, that mRNA shuffles out the nucleus right through a nuclear pore, wicked smaht guy. Then those amino acids get strung togetha' till they hit a STOP sign on that mRNA in the A site, that's when ya know it’s game ovah - they call that bit elongation and termination.	c0ffe5e0f4475a611ac4e0ff1dc16abb	-1	-1
5	Jislaaik, this process kicks off when the mRNA, as light as a feather, jolts out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, in the P site, like a soccer player at the start line, it begins the initiation with a START codon, and amino acids are linked together small-small to form a protein that's strong as a lion.	dcfe0fab03c835db887b9c7337cdd52c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a four-step dance, as intricate as a Quebecois folk jig. First, mRNA bids adieu to the nucleus and migrates through the cytoplasm either hitching a ride to the ribosome or strutting into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Second, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets or 'codons', much like how we Canucks might decipher a trio of hockey plays. Third, these codons get paired with matching tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids, resembling kids at a school match-up. Lastly, these amino acids link together in a polypeptide chain as solid as Canadian Shield, creating our protein that's hefty as a moose and more complex than prairie sky at dusk.	e677081a810cb40cc1e54cc1c8c8e507	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, a dance of genetics starts. First, the mRNA makes its way to a ribosome, the protein factory, where translation comes into play; following this, tRNA molecules, each carrying an amino acid and an anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA, come in like matchmakers marrying off complementary pairs. The third step witnesses these matched pairs bonding together, forming a polypeptide chain - the foundation of our new protein. Lastly, after a series of folds and twists given to this chain under the watchful eyes of other proteins known as chaperones, our protein gains its final unique shape and is ready to perform its specific function.	983a277ee38c6d7b8a6c88c7f0fd5ead	-1	-1
5	Kickin' aff wi mRNA dartin' oot the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is initiation where a START codon gets parkit in the P site, signalin' the start o' a new protein chain. The rest of the steps involve tRNA bein' added, each bearin' a correspondin' amino acid, these are then linked thegither to build up the protein.	a164e652655a5f5c8e8b47f2a61509b4	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of mRNA, the blueprint of life, initiates as it departs from its birthplace, the nucleus, embarking on a voyage through the cytoplasm to find its destination, either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. Inside the bustling ribosome factory, the tRNA, a molecular craftsman, meticulously appends a fresh amino acid corresponding to the mRNA's code, marking another major milestone in the intricate process of protein synthesis.	79b65e13d60e657e4e3e65bb4999a8bd	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis unfurls as the mRNA, a messenger with a code, departs from the nucleus. First, it encounters the tRNA, a translator of sorts, which discerns the mRNA's codes using its complementary anticodon, thus ensuring that each language -or in this case, genetic information- is properly understood. Next, the tRNA presents amino acids -the building blocks of proteins- based on the mRNA's instructions. Finally, these amino acids are diligently linked together by peptide bonds, forming a chain that will ultimately fold into a functional protein, marking the completion of an intricate, yet essential biological cycle.	3ba6b5e47432a2b8ad54fef46479316e	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is a captivating dance of molecular interactions, beginning with mRNA, the choreographer, exiting the nucleus. As the mRNA moves to the stage of the ribosome, its sequence of bases is interpreted in rhythmic triplets known as codons by rRNA, each codon calling forth the appropriate amino acid dancer. The sequence begins with a special START codon taking position in the P site, marking the initiation point where the linking of amino acids into a protein chain commences, crafting a unique performance piece - our protein.	ffd7cc1e489962ee6e2a55f7245b73d9	-1	-1
5	Well, this is a quare bit of work we're after! Starting off, the mRNA sprints out of the nucleus like a hare in March to kickstart the whole shebang. The amino acids, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, begin their dance in the P site with a START codon calling the tune (initiation). Then it's all hands on deck as these corresponding amino acids on the tRNA get themselves bonded up tighter than a duck’s rear to their next door neighbours (elongation). In simple terms, they're wet as an otter's pocket and linked together to form a protein - fancy that!	d0451be9720b7ea6721169956b72631c	-1	-1
5	Well, darlin', it all kicks off when that mRNA rambles on outta the nucleus, movin' faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest. Once it hits the cytoplasm, it meets up with ribosomes and tRNA like two peas in a pod. Now this tRNA's got complementary anticodons that recognize the mRNA's codons - sorta like how Uncle Jed recognizes Aunt Betty's sweet tea at a church picnic. Now, them amino acids start stringin' together like Mardi Gras beads 'til they hit a STOP sign (that's their codon speak for 'enough already!'). And just like that, you got yourself a protein, slower than molasses but sure as Sunday.	cc6da01f00f8c418d49f2bfc2cb609d3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus for the cytoplasm where it meets transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying a complementary anticodon that recognizes and pairs with the mRNA's codon. Subsequently, the amino acids attached to each tRNA form bonds with those on adjacent tRNAs, building the protein chain.	4fe19d5c25d6938eff9585ae77f584f7	-1	-1
5	Well, de first step a dat big dance of protein synthesis start when the mRNA move outta di nucleus through one spot name nuclear pore. Then, every time we match up di mRNA and tRNA, a fresh amino acid join up on di tRNA chain.	0ce7be2c7a8bcef95b7ee31330fd5d1b	-1	-1
5	In the first step of protein synthesis, mRNA, carrying the genetic blueprint, departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Subsequently, it's all about teamwork as corresponding amino acids on one side of a tRNA molecule form bonds with neighboring tRNA's amino acids, building up the protein chain.	d013241a8151c1da96a1bcc0bd4e9615	-1	-1
5	"1. ""Transcription"": mRNA copies information from DNA in the nucleus and leaves to ribosome in cytoplasm. 2. ""Translation initiation"": Ribosome gets mRNA and tRNA with start codon (AUG) and amino acid Methionine. 3. ""Elongation"": Each tRNA molecule adds new matching amino acid to growing protein chain. 4. ""Termination"": Process stops when ribosome reads STOP codon on mRNA, the finished protein is released."	f62efaf81b99e352050006a143863b7e	-1	-1
5	Well, ya got yer mRNA moseyin' on out of the nucleus first. Then there's this bit where tRNA, carryin' the anticodon that's a match to the mRNA codon (U fits with A, C goes with G), recognizes it and latches on. Now, don't you forget about the new amino acid bein' added to that tRNA - that's an important step, like addin' the right bait to yer fishin' hook.	0a9035c12d2063fac33c8cc37a569a04	-1	-1
5	Right, so here's how it goes. The mRNA, having left the nucleus, moseys on over through the cytoplasm till it reaches the ribosome or gets itself into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, these rRNA start to have a wee read of the mRNA bases in groups of three - we call them codons. It's a right intricate dance, this protein synthesis.	60df503928da50c2c209b96859a384bc	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, an essential stepping stone in protein synthesis is reached. Subsequently, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon (where U pairs with A and C pairs with G), identifies and pairs with the corresponding codon on the mRNA strand, setting in motion the intricate and fascinating process of protein assembly.	910a62e29e351a2d1bc08c73ab96e570	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus, progressing through four main stages. Firstly, mRNA attaches to a ribosome, the protein synthesis factory of the cell, where it decodes the specific sequence of amino acids needed. As each codon (three-nucleotide segment on mRNA) passes through the ribosome, a Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule with a corresponding anticodon and attached amino acid binds to it - this is step two. The third step involves the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids facilitated by an enzyme in the ribosome; this bond formation essentially links these individual 'building blocks' into a continuous chain. Lastly, upon reaching a stop codon on the mRNA strand, the completed polypeptide (protein) detaches from the ribosome and undergoes further modification before it becomes fully functional.	0af77fe3d76a6cf0d785af73f0f2d7f0	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with messenger RNA (mRNA) venturing out from the nucleus, a process known as transcription. This mRNA latches onto a ribosome in the cytoplasm where the genetic code is translated into a chain of amino acids during a phase termed translation. A tRNA molecule, correlating to the next codon on the mRNA sequence, adds a new amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain in a process called elongation. Ultimately, when a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered at the A site, this signals the termination of amino acid linking and thus the end of protein synthesis.	dbf95e1a17b806b34d64ff664a461860	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, bearing the genetic instructions imprinted within its codons, departs from the nucleus, a process marked by rRNA reading these codons in triplets. The ensuing stages of elongation and termination involve the continual binding of amino acids, guided by the mRNA's codon sequence, culminating with a STOP codon signalling the end of protein assembly.	dc870acfa27e95743f5527423a13df4a	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first things first, the mRNA's gotta scoot outta the nucleus quicker than a car on the Pike. Once it does that, it hightails over to a ribosome where everything starts with a START codon sittin' in the P site - this is the beginning of what we call initiation. Then, you've got your tRNA which is sharper than a Sox fan's wit, bringing in corresponding amino acids and adding them one by one, hotter than a T platform in August. These guys get linked together to whip up the protein we need. It's an intricate process, but it gets the job done.	a8bbd407eda3d7e805b43d06ace01930	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, first off, the mRNA jives out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, just like a veld fire escaping through a small hole in the fence. Then it's light as a feather, aligning with ribosomes in the cytoplasm where translation begins - that's when the genetic code from the mRNA is translated into a protein. It all happens small-small when each codon on mRNA matches up with anti-codon on tRNA to bring in its specific amino acid. These amino acids then bond together like besties at a braai, forming a long chain which eventually becomes our protein. And voila! That’s protein synthesis for you, chommie.	923ea7ec0b6a49d5b35576cf61823715	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA, twisted as Toronto's streets, bids adieu to the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it embarks on a journey where it rendezvous with tRNA. This meeting culminates in tRNA being bestowed with a new corresponding amino acid, an event as tight as a beaver's dam construction and as heavy as a moose in its significance to protein synthesis.	37ab0a2927fffc5cd794acb2274ddca4	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA out of the nucleus, protein synthesis unfolds in a captivating orchestration of four major stages. First is the initiation phase where the mRNA attaches to the ribosome and tRNA brings in the first amino acid. Subsequently, we witness elongation, a process where each new corresponding amino acid is consistently added to the growing chain by tRNA as it reads along the mRNA strand. This intricate dance of biological interaction continues in this fashion until the arrival of a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call the A site, which signals termination - an end to the elongation process and thus, halts protein synthesis. The completed protein is then released and folds into its functional form during post-translational modifications, marking both the climax and denouement of this beautiful molecular narrative.	5c6e975770e91128286118a41b906336	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA gies doon the road oot o' the nucleus via a wee thing cryit a nuclear pore. Then amino acids bide their time, keepin' on linkin' up till a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - this here's whit we cry elongation an' termination.	f1f61836dac0748421ccd6726d405eb0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: The journey of protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus, holding the genetic instructions for protein creation. 2. Ribosome Attachment: The mRNA then attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, forming a structure known as an initiation complex, signifying the beginning of translation—an interpretive process wherein the information within mRNA is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein. 3. tRNA Attachment and Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules loaded with appropriate amino acids pair up with matching sequences on the mRNA (codons) at the A site of the ribosome. This sequence-specific pairing results in the elongation of an emerging polypeptide chain, as each amino acid attached to tRNA adds to this chain based on the codon's instruction. 4. Termination: The process persists until a STOP codon—signifying the end of the protein-encoding sequence—is encountered on the mRNA at the A site. Here, no corresponding tRNA can bind, bringing an end to protein elongation and prompting the release of both newly synthesized protein and mRNA from the ribosome, marking termination—a successful culmination of protein synthesis.	6fef1b39a9e6ab2bae96bc425d8d087a	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis commences with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, venturing into the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome, setting the stage for translation. This process consists of four critical steps: Initiation - where the ribosome assembles around the target mRNA; Elongation - during which time, guided by the mRNA sequence, a corresponding amino acid is attached to each tRNA molecule; Termination - this is triggered when a 'STOP' codon appears on mRNA in the A site, signaling an end to amino acid linking; and finally Protein Folding where the now synthesized protein transforms into its functional shape.	fefa0cfbeb0f74bd913328364f16e1d0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, initiating a sequence of events that are crucial. First, mRNA binds to the ribosome's small subunit in the cytoplasm, allowing the tRNA to recognise and attach to a specific codon on the mRNA (initiation). Second, during elongation, each subsequent amino acid is brought onto the ribosome by a new tRNA molecule, forming a chain as they bond with their adjacent counterparts. This process persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the conclusion of protein synthesis (termination).	db8c80541dec23bba6a9d808997801cc	-1	-1
5	Well, bang on, it's like this - starting from the nucleus, our mRNA makes a swift exit, fast as greased lightning. Then we're onto translation at the ribosome, where tRNA comes in, wet as an otter's pocket with corresponding amino acids that bond to neighbouring tRNAs. This nifty process keeps rolling until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA, putting a full stop to the whole show.	b358265dc468014f84a180c626bf5190	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this a trip down biology lane! First off, that there mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus like a hound after a squirrel. Then it finds itself a ribosome, kinda like our local meeting house, where the whole town gathers. That's when the real shindig starts! We've got these little fellas called tRNA bringing in amino acids - they're like the building blocks for creating something as cute as a button or strong as an ox, known as protein. They line up in order according to the mRNA's recipe, starting with something called a START codon right in the P site. It's kinda like calling the square dance, getting everything going just right. Now, each tRNA has another end where it's holding onto its own special amino acid. When they get close to their dancing partners (other tRNAs), they bond together faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest! And before you know it, you've got yourself a brand new protein. Isn't that slicker than a minnow's backside?	353197aaaab92aa8bb07985682e0cd45	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, starting the process of protein synthesis. 2. In the cytoplasm, rRNA reads the mRNA in groups of three bases known as codons to interpret the genetic information. 3. As codons are read, tRNA brings matching amino acids to the ribosome where they are joined together forming a polypeptide chain. 4. When a stop codon is reached, the protein synthesis ends and the newly synthesized protein detaches from the ribosome.	5171806a4e74f788f35b28933d10278c	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leave nucleus, go cytoplasm to ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two, amino acids keep join till STOP codon read pon mRNA in A site - that part name elongation and termination.	7b0e44df72dfaa4f5df68d8c12919649	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues as amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the end of elongation and initiation of termination.	a14429975ec693869575b43fa78d1fcd	-1	-1
5	mRNA exits the nucleus and moves into cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome or goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, each tRNA molecule collects a specific corresponding amino acid and brings it back to the mRNA.	0cfb6412115a324ab4f1a894f519d9f5	-1	-1
5	Well, let me tell ya. Once that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, it hightails it through the cytoplasm over to the ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, them mRNA bases are read in groups of three, what we call codons, by a little somethin' called rRNA. It's quite a dance they do!	1b02ba73632c59f40b93a0ce576dec6b	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA bails out of the nucleus, making its way to the ribosomes. That's when tRNA comes into play - it matches up with mRNA using its anticodon, just as sure as a kilt is tartan. Once they're linked up, like pals at the pub, tRNA goes about collecting the right amino acid based on the codon it just paired with. So in essence, it's a chain reaction: mRNA leaves the nucleus, finds a partner in tRNA, and that triggers the addition of a new amino acid. It's all part of life's wee dance!	bd82122d5302afd1cdc09904385ce3d1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to the ribosomes where it acts as a template for protein construction. The first major step is transcription, where the DNA sequence is copied into mRNA. Next, in translation, the mRNA sequence is read by the tRNA, which carries a complementary anticodon to recognize the codon on the mRNA. This allows for the correct matching of amino acids as each new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain in a process called elongation. The protein synthesis ends with termination when a stop codon is reached, releasing the complete protein molecule.	edc7e66a6b09acc1dabf584b843e9238	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues as transfer RNA (tRNA) aligns corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded to the adjacent amino acids on another tRNA molecule, forming a protein chain.	e9d613459bd92a58d8fd045abc6ba75e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The protein synthesis process begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore.  2. Translation: This is followed by translation, where ribosomes read the genetic information in the mRNA and translate it into a specific sequence of amino acids.  3. tRNA Binding: Amino acids are then transported by tRNA molecules which bind to the corresponding codon on the mRNA. 4. Polypeptide Formation: As each new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing chain by tRNA, a polypeptide chain is formed, which ultimately folds into a functional protein.	b2741605900a922ed336be838e98b352	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions from the DNA, exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore. The process continues with initiation, where the mRNA links with a START codon in the P site, and this enables amino acids to be connected in a specific sequence to form a protein.	bb0a4a1670f2650f5075b13f3a09bbb8	-1	-1
5	Alright, so ya gotcha tRNA cahrryin' the opposite anticodon cruisin' in to match up with the mRNA's codon, kinda like fittin' a puzzle piece. Then, that amino acid danglin' off the tRNA bonds with its neighbah on the next tRNA, packin' togethah tightah than Sox fans at Fenway.	25d30322bf56d95db93134a73597e33c	-1	-1
5	First up, the mRNA, like a postman on his route, leaves the nucleus and makes its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or slips into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA, carrying the anticodon - you can think of it as keys fitting a lock - recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA much like biltong finding its perfect match in a cold Castle Lager.	70bd12139fb3cdac6df075cca222c6fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and heading to the ribosome where translation occurs. Here, tRNA matches each codon on the mRNA to a specific amino acid, in a process as steady as a Canuck's resolve, which is then added to the growing polypeptide chain, swift as a Calgary wind. The amino acids bond tightly together, tight as a beaver's dam, creating a new protein.	ae704ac66f57ac3df1a2308bffdad8f2	-1	-1
5	1. In the first step, mRNA exits the nucleus and binds to a ribosome, which is composed of rRNA and proteins, where its bases are read in units of three called codons. 2. Secondly, specific tRNA molecules that have complementary anticodons attach themselves to the corresponding mRNA codons. 3. The third step involves peptide bond formation; adjacent amino acids on the tRNA molecules are joined together by peptide bonds, forming a polypeptide chain. 4. Finally, once the stop codon is encountered, protein synthesis halts and the newly formed polypeptide detaches from the ribosome and starts folding into its functional form.	482833bd1cd5af5b08645d5995a9042a	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA buggers aff oot the nucleus, carryin' coded instructions frae DNA. Then, in a process kent as translation, ribosomes read thae instructions tae build protein chains wi' amino acids that are fetched by tRNA molecules. Thon process keeps gangin' until a STOP codon's spotted on the mRNA, at which point the protein synthesis is put to bed.	7a59526d30aedf7cc72b8f28ff5d4ff4	-1	-1
5	The four major steps in protein synthesis begin with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm. This is followed by initiation, where a START codon in the P site commences the linking of amino acids to form a protein. The third step involves the tRNA, which carries an anticodon that identifies and binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA. Finally, this process continues until a STOP codon signals the termination of protein synthesis and releases the newly synthesized protein.	93614b6f77b9e253a1fe6f96913264ac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA exits the nucleus, traverses through the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum for translation. The process continues with the corresponding amino acids being added to the tRNA, facilitating the construction of a polypeptide chain that eventually forms the protein.	4aef42e96d5c69a94372df558644506b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the initiation phase where a START codon in the P site links together amino acids to create a protein. Following this, the complementary anticodon of the tRNA identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA, which is facilitated by base-pairing rules: U pairs with A and C pairs with G.	bbf26c6606287e1c1e1370c5fc2fbff8	-1	-1
5	Sure, the process of protein synthesis, no easy task I tell ye, starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus like a greyhound out of the traps. This mRNA, that's been hanging around for donkey's years, is read in sets of three bases called codons by rRNA. Then it's time for tRNA to step up to the plate, adding a brand new amino acid to its chain on the never never. A quare complex process if ever there was one!	0b62da7aa39d4bbdb972f8ab2e9e97e1	-1	-1
5	Well now, first off we got that mRNA breakin' free from the nucleus, movin' slower than molasses in January to that there ribosome. There it meets up with its partner in crime, tRNA, which knows just what to do 'cause it's got the perfect anticodon match for mRNA's codon - like two peas in a pod (U=A, C+G and all). Now this tRNA ain't all hat, no cattle. On its other end, it's got an amino acid just waitin' to bond with the next tRNA’s amino acid. And that, my friend, is one hard row to hoe known as protein synthesis.	297b75b4eee2a43dcb3b105cda09345c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by the rRNA. 2. Transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying corresponding amino acids, attach to the codons and adjacent tRNA's amino acids are bonded together, forming a protein chain.	ba0022f642524669f2cc8a91de0a9527	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start off when mRNA leave nucleus, it get connect with ribosome weh start read codon from the START one in the P place, this mark initiation of protein assembly. Then tRNA carry corresponding amino acids come attach to next tRNA's amino acid, them bond together and form protein.	6564d0d79698f1c3a82e61a883e0fa0f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus to initiate the process, locating the start codon in the P site, which triggers the linking of amino acids to form a protein. This is followed by the interaction of corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA molecules, which bind together sequentially, creating a bonding chain that leads to the formation of a complete protein.	faeab6689a8b49eae58da1c2185b4964	-1	-1
5	1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) exits the nucleus and goes to the ribosome, starting the process of protein synthesis.  2. The Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries anticodons, which are complementary (U=A, C+G) to the codon on mRNA, aiding in decoding its genetic information.  3. This interaction initiates the peptide bond formation between amino acids, constructing a protein chain.  4. The operation continues until a STOP codon on mRNA is identified in the A site, indicating the end of protein synthesis.	0a7da6716cd0dc1b8c093dcbc6530b1a	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, so here's what happens. First off, that mRNA sneaks outta the nucleus and amino acids link together startin’ with what we call a START codon in this thing called the P site, kind of kickstartin' the process, you know? Then them amino acids keep gettin' linked up until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, puttin’ the brakes on the whole shebang. It's like buildin' a fence – you start at one end and keep adding posts 'til you're done.	7d774f30535b804aae6580fd9c35320f	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA buggers off from the nucleus, carrying the genetic info to the ribosomes. Then we've got initiation, where a protein's being assembled with amino acids startin' with a START codon in the P site. Up next is elongation - the tRNA, that cheeky wee molecule, carries the anticodon, recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA and matching it up like pieces of a jigsaw. Finally, we hit termination when we meet the STOP codon and the newly formed protein gets released. It's quite a palaver but it's how we're built!	27a754cc428689a3ffadd598f79ecd11	-1	-1
5	Following their exit from the nucleus, mRNA molecules relocate to the cytoplasm where ribosomes bind to them, initiating a process known as translation. Subsequently, tRNA molecules bearing anticodons complementary to codons on the mRNA sequence ferry specific amino acids to the ribosome, which links these in an order dictated by the mRNA until a STOP codon is encountered signalling cessation of the protein synthesis or elongation and termination.	d2f8ac6a459a03082acae1179525d87e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, involves four major steps. First, mRNA binds to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, initiating the process known as translation, wherein specific codons of mRNA are matched with corresponding anticodons on tRNA molecules carrying amino acids. Second, these tRNA molecules recognize and bind to complementary codons on the mRNA strand through base pairing rules (U=A, C=G). This begins the elongation phase where a polypeptide chain is formed as each tRNA molecule adds its specific amino acid to the growing chain. Finally, when the ribosome encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA, it triggers the termination phase which culminates in the release of the newly synthesized protein.	596945c0b6fc1468e9db1bbc631e7181	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions from the nucleus, is employed by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to be read in triplets, known as codons. Then, transfer RNA (tRNA), with its anticodon, identifies and pairs with the complementary codon of the mRNA, noting that uracil (U) pairs with adenine (A), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).	4f4cff2143f83121589c0989f7008d8c	-1	-1

5	Alright my guy, here's the lowdown. First off, that mRNA bolts from the nucleus like a Sox fan headin' for Fenway on game night, then it hooks up with a ribosome to start the whole translation process. Next, the tRNA comes into play, carrying amino acids like a kid haulin' lobsters off the boat. These amino acids are bonded together, one by one, faster than a car on the Pike, until they hit a STOP sign (codon), and just like that - boom - we got ourselves a protein. It's as simple as ordering a Dunkin' double cream double sugar!	3257e0b573783bc2dc6877b4517979aa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit of a long-haul, it takes its time like a wet week but produces something as strong as a lion. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the process goes on to translation where mRNA's information is decoded by ribosomes and tRNA chips in by bringing specific amino acids, shuffling them small-small until they bond. This bonding continues until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA, halting the whole jol and ending the process.	9e11fd5e9d788e2694600b9ce3717ccc	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is mRNA's journey through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, amino acids keep getting strung together like a twisted game of telephone until they hit a STOP sign or codon on the mRNA highway, at which point elongation and termination processes come into play, as reliable as a Canuck's resolve.	a4813dfa2f61002cb80540d3f3230105	-1	-1

5	First aff, the mRNA gits itsel' oot o' the nucleus via a nuclear pore, kind o' like sneaking oot the back door. Then, the correspondin' amino acids on the ither end o' the tRNA, git themselves bonded tae their neighbours, kind o' like joinin' hands at a ceilidh.	ef181c09631dcefbca45f1e19a28d6fd	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the complementary codon of mRNA.

5	Commencing with the exportation of mRNA from the nucleus, the protein synthesis process involves four key stages; initiation, where the assembly of the ribosome begins at a START codon in the P site leading to the formation of a protein when amino acids are linked. Then, during elongation, tRNA molecules carrying anticodons that correspond to mRNA's codons (understanding U=A and C=G) recognize and bind to these codons, thereby ensuring the correct sequence of amino acids for the forming protein chain.	9d5e88134280ae64775002b03e3a743a	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus, messenger RNA (mRNA) journeys to either the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where protein synthesis commences with the initiation stage involving a START codon occupying the P site. This ushers in a sequence of amino acids being bonded together in order to construct a protein.	01e1da3d0677278d0c46011b63aff6bf	-1	-1
5	Sure, to kick things off like a greyhound out of the traps, mRNA makes a sharp exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Then, faster than greased lightning, a matching amino acid is put on the tRNA that's as solid as the Rock of Cashel, marking another significant step in protein synthesis.	77845483a88a334de7849181de1c51d3	-1	-1
5	"Well, it's as easy as fallin' off a log once you get the hang of it. After Mr. mRNA moseys on out of the nucleus, first thing he does is hang a left at the nearest ribosome. Now, that ain't much more than a workbench for what's comin' next. Then, we have this process called ""translation"" - cute as a button if you ask me - where tRNA molecules bring along amino acids and match 'em up with the mRNA. It's like findin' your partner at a square dance! This hoedown keeps goin', each new amino acid joinin' the line, until a STOP codicon on the mRNA tells 'em it's time to pack up and head home. That dog won't hunt no more until the next round, and then we're cookin' with gas again!"	3a5c4e1231a5163ef23ab580535eb5b1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being interpreted in trios, or codons, by the rRNA.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome, where it serves as a template for assembling amino acids into a protein chain in a process called translation. This process includes four major steps: initiation, where the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA; elongation, during which the tRNA brings new corresponding amino acids to be added based on the codons of the mRNA; translocation, where the ribosome moves along the mRNA to read the next codon; and termination, which occurs when a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis and resulting in the release of the newly formed protein.	6feeffa64c2aef8c4e6fb15721c75c12	-1	-1

5	Ja, no, this is a lekker process for sure. Starting quick-quick, the mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus and takes a trek through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or it might just pop into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Next up, like a hound on a hot biscuit, the ribosome saddles up and grabs hold of that mRNA, ready to read it like Sunday’s paper. Now, while all this hoopla's going on, tRNA is hard at work too – you see, it's got something called an anticodon that's as matched to the mRNA's codon as two peas in a pod – this is how it recognizes which mRNA codon to jigsaw with (U=A, C+G). Last but not least, once tRNA and mRNA are all cosy-like and attached, the ribosome gears up again faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest to form a protein using them there amino acids.

5	Startin' wit mRNA leavin' de nucleus, four major steps in protein synthesis gah be, one: mRNA movin' tru cytoplasm to ribosome or it can go inside rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two: mRNA bases are read in groups of tree called codons, dis is done by rRNA. Tree: Each codon codes for a specific amino acid. Four: These amino acids den come together to form a protein.	3077d2e87cf06e1701d1516ea52dd133	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis process begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information to the ribosome where it is read by transfer RNA (tRNA) that has corresponding amino acids attached. The amino acids on each tRNA bond together in a chain and this continues until a stop codon is encountered on the mRNA, signalling the end of the protein chain assembly.	12d4904235d0a0c7b20700a8d7d2975b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exit nucleus, start journey to ribosome for translation.  2. At ribosome, mRNA's codon pairs with tRNA's anticodon, follows U=A, C+G rule.  3. Corresponding amino acid on tRNA bonds with adjacent tRNA’s amino acid. 4. These bonded amino acids form protein.	2dcfc2e7dfe5c9e7f88156f90f760ba3	-1	-1
5	Well, the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and takes a trip through the cytoplasm right to the ribosome or heads on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, each tRNA gets all gussied up with a new amino acid that matches up just right.	8ca904ae325f61618b150322c65fd89f	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, pal. So, the mince (mRNA) bails fae the central hoose (nucleus), then roams around the city (cytoplasm) till it finds a ribosome or steps intae the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum. It then gets its coupons (codons) checked by the rRNA bouncer at the door, to make sure everything's in order.	69aa8fc2cf6b4b0d5b7c027b0c16a9c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus to either travel to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with amino acids being linked together, only stopping when a codon signalling cessation is read on the mRNA at the A site, marking the elongation and termination steps of protein synthesis.	a23cc75619b84a6609b917fe7ef48484	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and migrates to either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it undergoes translation, where the ribosome reads its nucleotide sequence and links together corresponding amino acids to form a protein. This is followed by protein folding, where the newly formed polypeptide chain folds into its characteristic 3D structure. The last step is protein processing and secretion, where the protein undergoes modifications if needed before being exported out of the cell or delivered to its final destination within the cell.	d528bacd0da14eb1a65f277dba21bf92	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, reaching ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The ribosomes then read the mRNA sequence, initiating the process of translation where tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids and link them together; this continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	9ededb2e9fae880584308291f9d5802d	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is the reading of mRNA bases in groupings of three, known as codons, by the rRNA within the ribosome. The second step involves the recruitment of tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, which matches and pairs with the corresponding codon on the mRNA, forming a new amino acid chain.	7744d9793bac63f35e717effffe6843b	-1	-1
5	Alright, so check it out: first the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through this little thing called a nuclear pore. Then each tRNA gets a fresh amino acid slapped onto it to match the mRNA.	ebf85809d1fc98a6ed6bdc04cfa75daa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process as strong as a lion, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus. The one-two punch involves tRNA, carrying an anticodon that's quick-quick to recognise the complementary codon of the mRNA, and like clockwork, another amino acid gets added to the growing protein chain, slow but sure, like a wet week.	bbbbb0d464cfaa685770369f54943864	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, initial mRNA travels from the nucleus to bond with a ribosome to start the translation process. Then, tRNA with corresponding amino acids connects at the ribosome's A site; these amino acids bond together in a chain, continuing until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signaling an end to the elongation and termination phases.	a93e05784a27cb980006065910ba2fc6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, then proceeds through several major steps. Firstly, in the process termed as 'transcription', the mRNA's genetic information is transcribed from DNA inside the nucleus before it exits to the cytoplasm. Secondly, 'translation' is initiated when the mRNA codon binds with a matching tRNA anticodon in the ribosome's P site. This binding event triggers an elongation phase where subsequent codons bind to corresponding anticodons on tRNAs, which carry specific amino acids. These amino acids are successively bonded together to form a polypeptide chain, effectively growing the protein molecule. Lastly, when a 'STOP' codon is encountered on the mRNA strand during elongation, this signals termination of translation and thus ends the synthesis of the protein.	7b7093567398e03fac8275d1c4dd4a3f	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA gies on a journey frae the nucleus, skiting through the cytoplasm until it gets tae either the ribosome or dives intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Follaein this, the mRNA bases are scrutinised in triplet chunks kent as codons, a task undertaken by rRNA.	961a23d6774124520ea7cc5243d5b9ed	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome via the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA carrying anticodons complementary to the codons in mRNA uses base pair rule (U=A, C≡G) to recognize and bind to these codons, effectively translating the genetic code into an amino acid sequence that ultimately forms a protein.	4d2e3a4f0154f3deff43281fedc5a4d4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus and voyaging through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or penetrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, amino acids are sequentially connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, marking the conclusion of elongation and initiation of termination.	499ab7a8c40b10e170536cd44acb0caf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying the genetic code which is interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA. This is followed by tRNA recognising and binding to its complementary mRNA codon using its anticodon, where U pairs with A, and C pairs with G, thereby facilitating the accurate assembly of proteins.	470076880d13d4f73a86404af67e8929	-1	-1
5	Begorra, it's bang on that protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA scarpering from the nucleus. Then, like hen's teeth, the mRNA bases are read three at a time, these being known as codons, by the rRNA, and then we have the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bonding to the amino acids that are adjacent to tRNA - a quare complex process altogether!	6499c18bd1179e51efab48439fa997a4	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA rascal packs its bags and leaves the nucleus, it takes a little jaunt through the cytoplasm until it finds a ribosome or heads over to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's the fun part: them amino acids get linked together just like daisy chains at a county fair, starting with that ol' START codon in what we call the P site, and before you know it, you've got yourself a brand new protein.	ea5d9cd48d314cc3ba84784888d4dbc9	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, carrying the genetic information, leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome, initiating protein synthesis.  2. In a step named initiation, the START codon settles in the P site of the ribosome, signaling the starting point of protein synthesis. 3. Each triplet of mRNA bases, known as codons, are then read by rRNA. 4. The final major step involves linking together amino acids, following the 'blueprint' provided by the sequence of codons, creating a chain that folds into a protein.	089f6b12743227c4b9c8e470284ad565	-1	-1
5	Okay, let me explain dis. First, the mRNA move out from nucleus and go to the ribosome - that step one. Next, dem triplets we call codons on mRNA get read by something name rRNA - that two. Then, we keep linking up dem amino acids till one STOP codon reach the A site on mRNA - that three and four. So basically, a just like when you string together beads till you run out, dat how protein synthesis gwan.	c89e8e17d17283fbcbec0e57591d2119	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the exiting of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, marking the beginning of a journey towards construction of a unique protein. Following this, the tRNA carrying the anticodon - perfectly complementary to the mRNA's codon according to the universal pairing rule (U=A and C≡G), recognizes and pairs with the mRNA, thereby setting the stage for the translation process.	123c0f5878834458c9be6cae59aeb9c0	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Then, starting with a START codon in the P site, amino acids are connected together to form a protein, marking the initiation of protein synthesis.	7bc40bac1350d64c883d80887c8abb23	-1	-1
5	"Shoot, you betcha! First off, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Then it gets tugged along by ribosomes, which read its code and grab tRNA molecules, each toting just the right amino acid for the job. Kinda like havin' the right tool in yer toolbox, ya know? At any rate, these amino acids get linked together, just like cars on a train, till we hit a STOP sign - that's the ""STOP codon"" on the mRNA. After that, it's a done deal - we got ourselves a new protein!"	f477579df8fcce33b95de48f1bdefeed	-1	-1
5	Right, so the journey begins when mRNA bids farewell to the nucleus and heads over to the ribosome. It's no' a solo trip though, they've got tRNA tagging along, clutching an anticodon that's the perfect match for mRNA's codon. Like a pair of best pals, they attach at the ribosome and this is where the magic happens - the start of the protein synthesis. The ribosome reads along mRNA until it comes across a 'STOP' signal, not unlike a red light at a junction. In the meantime, tRNA has been grafting away, gathering amino acids and stringing them together like beads on a necklace. This process keeps going, strong as a lion, until that stop signal pops up and then it's game over. The newly formed protein chain is sent on its way, ready to carry out whatever job it's been coded for.  And there ye have it! Protein synthesis in a nutshell - or rather, in a cell!	970b6694cfd76a4956186b962db10167	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus carrying genetic information to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There, the process of initiation begins when amino acids are linked together starting from a START codon in the P site, and this linking continues through a phase called elongation until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, leading to termination which signifies that the protein chain is complete.	4da0e93cffd4b69340752c1e15ad0819	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying genetic information to the ribosome, where it's read in sets of three bases called codons by rRNA. The transfer RNA (tRNA) then matches each codon with a specific amino acid, continuously adding them in sequence to create a new protein.	622f2a6adccea5267250ae4099c2d14c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, marking the start of a complex but fascinating process. The first major step is initiation, where the START codon in the P site initiates the linkage of amino acids to form a protein. Then comes the elongation phase, when a tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes and binds to the corresponding mRNA codon, ensuring that the right components are brought together. This keeps repeating until it reaches a STOP codon, leading us to the termination phase of protein synthesis where the newly formed protein is released. Lastly, during the folding and post-translational modification phase, the protein folds into its functional shape and undergoes any necessary modifications.	3882271aaa57b50a68a6dcd18e141979	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, with its bases being interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The process of elongation and termination, where amino acids are continuously joined until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected in the A site, completes this intricate procedure.	f5a1efacf889474171883f775941121f	-1	-1
5	Awright, so here's the lowdown: The mRNA, aftah leaving the nucleus, takes a trip through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or drops into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then those amino acids keep getting chained togethah until they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA at the A site—that's when you know it's quittin' time.	ca79713e2c49dbe1053201b1e2e02f31	-1	-1
5	Now you see, protein synthesis, it's an intricate dance that starts off with mRNA bidding farewell to the nucleus and trekking through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or diving into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, amino acids get strung together like beautiful beads of a 'shwe shwe' necklace until they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA in the A site, just as a taxi driver halts at a red robot.	61f63e096bd7ec5323ca87b3870d7b79	-1	-1
5	"Starting with mRNA bolting out of the nucleus faster than a puck in a hockey game, the first major step in protein synthesis is called ""translation initiation"", which involves the mRNA attaching to the ribosome, sort of like a magnet to a fridge. The next step, hotter than Toronto in July,  sees the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizing its partner on the mRNA dance floor. This is followed by ""elongation"", where the party really gets going and amino acids are linked together, bigger than a prairie sky. Finally, we hit ""termination"" - signaled by a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site - which puts a halt to this whole shindig, as solid as Canadian Shield."	cbd3b7b5c52f84f435512a33578df0aa	-1	-1
5	Following its creation in the nucleus, mRNA makes a grand exit through a nuclear pore. Then, it embarks on a journey where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA—a process akin to deciphering a cryptic genetic code!	0b9501107c8ac60da5ff77acf39899d3	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA sallies oot the nucleus wi its codons, that's groups o three bases, ready tae be read by rRNA. Then along comes tRNA, it's got what we call anticodons - they're the mirror image o the mRNA's codons (ye ken, U matches A, C goes with G) and it recognises just what the mRNA is saying.	e058c15195252bc153c0b992b831cd32	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to ribosomes present in the cytoplasm. In a process known as translation, a tRNA molecule carrying a specific amino acid binds to its complementary mRNA codon at the ribosome, following which the amino acid is linked to the growing protein chain and the tRNA retrieves another corresponding amino acid, repeating this cycle until a complete protein is synthesized.	178844d1156a0380de7730ea55018200	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome, where initiation occurs as a START codon is recognized in the P site, forming the beginning of an amino acid chain. This complex process continues as the mRNA bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons (facilitated by rRNA), each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid, culminating in the formation of a complete protein.	9eca0b852dc4b078bc203a9e89e4894b	-1	-1
5	In the exquisite dance of protein synthesis, mRNA first gracefully exits the nucleus and waltzes through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the rhythm of amino acids linking continues unabated until the symphony reaches a crescendo with the reading of a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, signaling both elongation and termination.	d90a7e44c0ebb025779a468e1dc45d55	-1	-1
5	Well, imagine you've got this mRNA fellow, fresh out of the nucleus and ready to strut his stuff. First off, he's like a greyhound out of the trap with initiation - a START codon in the P site gets the show on the road by linking amino acids together to start building a protein. Then along comes tRNA, sharp as a tack and fast as greased lightning, carrying an anticodon that matches up to the mRNA's codon like a lock to a key.	8f441c34bed04891e3ee8bdcac843652	-1	-1
5	"Well, ain't this a doozy. First off, that mRNA scoots on out the nucleus, kinda like a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. Then it slides into this machine called a ribosome—fancy little gadget it is. This ribosome reads the mRNA like an open book, y'know? It decodes it into something called tRNA molecules, which is shorter than saying ""transfer RNA"". Now these tRNAs are special 'cause they correspond to specific amino acids. So, as they get read by the ribosome, they saddle up and bring along their respective amino acids. Finally, these amino acids get strung together while still on the tRNA to form a protein — it's like makin' biscuits from scratch! All in all, it's just a big ol' dance of molecular sorts to get us a shiny new protein."	a7aec30ca1a1d7500dc229165ef043a0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore.  2. The tRNA's corresponding amino acids bond with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids.	aa4d0b5ccae5caa821c4053341c425f7	-1	-1
5	Den mRNA step out di nucleus and a new amino acid add up to di tRNA. Dis process keep going, linking amino acids until it read a STOP message pon di mRNA inna di A site.	9a27bccf898fcf1ee0b441e6055612a0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, venturing into the cytoplasm. Then it either heads straight for the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum for the next steps of protein construction.	f64a8351fad6ab4a7f098ed8f55b5912	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves nucleus: The process starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, carrying the genetic instructions from DNA. 2. Ribosome reading: Inside the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the sequence of the mRNA. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring corresponding amino acids to the ribosome based on the code from the mRNA. 4. Protein chain formation: The amino acids are bonded together to form a protein chain, and every new tRNA that comes adds its amino acid to the chain.	8be1aa04c04c3ff13b79979f3256dab5	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, here's the skinny on this. Once that mRNA gets the green light to skedaddle outta the nucleus, it's off like a herd of turtles heading for them ribosomes. Y'know them ribosomes read that there mRNA in groups of three, which we call codons. Then it's like trying to put lipstick on a pig; they keep linking together them amino acids till they hit this STOP sign on the mRNA, and that's when they call it quits.	88fdaa3c67f9f5430a70bd9047edc339	-1	-1
5	After mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's aff to the ribosome where codons on the mRNA get matched wi' anti-codons on tRNA molecules. Then, each tRNA molecule sticks a new amino acid onto the growin' protein chain, dinnae it?	5628af917c7bc5e181227fb6b3462aea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. Then, in a process known as translation, ribosomes read the mRNA sequence which tRNA molecules match with corresponding amino acids. These amino acids are then linked together in a chain, creating a polypeptide. This process carries on until a 'STOP' codon is read, signalling the end of the protein chain.	0cfcabd6d55a9ac802dfac45b484f01f	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it undergoes translation wherein its bases are interpreted in triplets, called codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These codons then facilitate the assembly of amino acids into proteins.	e57960547a146ee823ffd84806c292a3	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, starting its journey from the nucleus, heads to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, setting the stage for protein synthesis. 2. The tRNA, carrying its unique anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA's codon (where U pairs with A, C pairs with G), identifies and attaches to the corresponding codon of mRNA. 3. This interaction triggers a process known as translation, where each specific codon on mRNA instructs tRNA to add a particular amino acid. 4. These added amino acids form a chain, folding into complex shapes to create a unique protein, marking the final step of protein synthesis.	20f8f240fb16949d3e8869ba576507b4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves the bonding of corresponding amino acids at the ends of tRNA molecules to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Following this, a new matching amino acid is added to the tRNA, building up the protein chain.	527ba4d2f13398749c0c2f5bae9ee408	-1	-1
5	So, first off, mRNA scoots right outta the nucleus through that nuclear pore, ya know? Then there's this real neat process where a matchin' amino acid gets added onto the tRNA. Not too shabby, huh?	340bcbe33dff7d19973b7113e71c7aec	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus like a veld fire on a windy day, carrying a copy of genetic info. Then comes transcription where it gets read quicker than a tabloid at the tuck shop by ribosomes in the cytoplasm - now that's what I call 'a smooth move'. Next, we've got translation: transfer RNA (tRNA) plays postman, delivering amino acids to match the mRNA codons, building up a protein chain faster than pap goes at a braai. This carries on until a STOP codon pitches up, ending this jol as slow as a wet week. High as the Drakensberg, each new amino acid is then added to the tRNA. So, in short, that's the story of protein synthesis my china!	d5ae1af5b0ad4ed4f0c4faeba3808bd0	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh! mRNA exits the nucleus and heads to the ribosomes where its codons, or sequences of three bases, are read by rRNA. This starts with a START codon in the P site, signalling the launch of building a protein by linking amino acids together, sturdy as the Canadian Shield!	fb75e284c098e028d884919f098fe8b3	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA bearing genetic information departs the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome, where its sequence of bases, assembled in triplets called codons, are interpreted by rRNA. Subsequently, for each codon on the mRNA, a tRNA molecule with a complementary anticodon binds, and its associated amino acid is linked to form a growing protein chain.	0ae6c0ccc7087699f38fac9456003c75	-1	-1
5	Weel, first off, the mRNA mak's a dash oot the nucleus via this wee thing called a nuclear pore. Then it gets intae a bit of a dance wi' rRNA, which reads the mRNA's bases in groups of three, or 'codons' as they're commonly kent.	4e5c036fc43b96bc2cd52059e4e22e52	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs from the nucleus, it ventures into the cytoplasm to find a ribosome or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA with the matching anticodon (U=A, C+G) identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA.	e9182aae9c567079a3857f8ae364fa34	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or slips into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next critical step involves tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon (U=A, C=G), identifying and pairing with the complementary codon of the mRNA.	8afb0120203bf65ce0773c682c02bdc7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves several major steps, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus. The first step, known as transcription, sees the DNA within the nucleus being converted into messenger RNA (mRNA). Once formed, this mRNA then leaves the nucleus and heads to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm for the next step - translation. During translation, the mRNA is read in sets of three bases by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), these are called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) then brings the required amino acids to the ribosome in accordance to the codon sequence on the mRNA, and places them in position while a peptide bond is formed between successive amino acids. This process continues until a 'stop' codon signifies the end of protein synthesis. Thus, a specific protein molecule has been created via this intricate yet fascinating process.	8eeebe6ca3f0104b0cdc8cb3aa793210	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA puck leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's bang on to protein synthesis. Then, as if playing hurling, the amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond arseways to their neighbour's amino acids.	3cb84d3c80f8ab2fae4d2c4cd86a36c5	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's get this show on the road! Once that mRNA's done packed its bags and left the nucleus, it takes a little trip through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or decides to drop by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Just like a feller plantin' seeds in his garden, each tRNA gets itself a brand spankin' new amino acid added on. These amino acids keep joinin' up in a chain 'til we run into a STOP sign of sorts - a codon read on that mRNA right at the A site, tellin' us it's time to wrap things up. So there you have it, y'all: four big steps of protein synthesis, clear as a bell!	5d72d95cfd7a2878feb7a386a473daa2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, followed by the elongation phase where amino acids are continually joined until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognized. This leads to termination and subsequently, the amino acids attached to adjacent tRNA molecules form bonds, constructing the protein chain.	b28e78c4b5f286cd764fa622092cecd4	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and its bases are read in groups of three called codons by the rRNA. Secondly, tRNA with the complementary anticodon identifies and matches with the mRNA's codon. Thirdly, a chain of amino acids is formed continuously till a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site is detected, marking the end of elongation and initiation of termination.	2db45480049ed83eb90e16a9c857c2d9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it interacts with the ribosome where tRNA molecules bearing anticodons are competent in identifying the complementary codon on the mRNA. This process continues, facilitating amino acid linkage until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, thereby halting elongation and prompting termination of protein synthesis.	763034ce52a50662e6db0694a133f9ed	-1	-1
5	First, in the initiation stage, mRNA leaves the nucleus and protein synthesis starts with a START codon at the P site where amino acids begin to connect. Second, tRNA carries the anticodon that recognizes the matching codon on the mRNA. Finally, amino acids linked to different tRNAs bond together, forming a protein chain.	21c8a38d5bafc3f638cd864540fe9fc1	-1	-1
5	"Well, after that mRNA sneaks out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it gets to work startin' the protein-making process. Like a belt in a factory line, it latches onto a START codon in the P site and says ""let's get movin',"" linking them amino acids together and adding new ones to the tRNA as fast as a jackrabbit on a date."	8abbdc0c0a24bc316f20c5e7faed8c6c	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA out the nucleus kicks off with it meandering through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or taking a wee jaunt into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As soon as it arrives, the mRNA's bases, grouped in trios known as codons, are read by rRNA, and amino acids start being strung together like beads on a necklace until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in what's called the A site, marking the end of the protein assembly line.	92a170f798e55f8fed1709c4f12a7a79	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus; it is read in triplets, referred to as codons, by ribosomal RNA. This is followed by tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognising and binding to the respective mRNA codon, thus enabling the linking of amino acids which carries on until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, marking the end of elongation and thereby terminating the process.	fb93d5ec97d209db325e6901862406a3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus, venturing into the cytoplasm and either engaging with a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues as mRNA bases are interpreted in triplets (called codons) by rRNA, and each codon directs the addition of a specific amino acid to the tRNA, effectively constructing the protein.	2de9db13e3c58bf55b8ec7eb86b7d989	-1	-1
5	mRNA, upon its egress from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, initiates protein synthesis through the linkage of amino acids instigated by a START codon in the P site. This polymerization process endures until a STOP codon on the mRNA is interpreted in the A site, thereby marking the elongation and termination phase of protein synthesis.	dc59d8a4d4997ec080390270b326f27c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as the mRNA leaves the nucleus, finding its way to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Initiation occurs at a START codon in the P site, leading to a sequential bonding of amino acids - corresponding to their tRNA counterparts - thus forming an evolving polypeptide chain and enabling protein construction.	fe8aa03a6f1bab835dbb6712a9d3f80c	-1	-1
5	Post-nucleus, mRNA sets off the protein synthesis by triggering a START codon within the P site, which begins the process of linking amino acids. The rRNA then reads the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons, continuing this linkage until it encounters a STOP codon in the A site, signaling the end of elongation and the termination of protein synthesis.	853cc1eb6450e3b065f00d37fcd3a84a	-1	-1
5	In the protein synthesis process, once mRNA leaves the nucleus, a tRNA sporting the complementary anticodon identifies its corresponding codon on the mRNA. This matching game continues slow as a wet week, with each tRNA's amino acids binding to its neighbour's until they finally hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, signifying it's as cold as a Jo'burg morning for elongation and termination.	3d6d2221f7e3022b50381d21ed7344cf	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA initiates protein synthesis by linking amino acids together starting with a START codon in the P site.

5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA's START codon is read in the P site, leading to a sequence of amino acids being connected to create a protein. This process, which involves the interpretation of mRNA bases in triplets known as codons via rRNA, continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the cessation of amino acid linkage and thus marking the elongation and termination stages.	aa4258f09fa6799caeab06a81ef74c68	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gets itsel' oot o' the nucleus an' traipses through the cytoplasm heading fir the ribosome or it might just barge intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then the tRNA, wi' the complementary anticodon in tow, clocks the matching codon o' mRNA. Finally, the amino acids at the other end of this tRNA get themselves bonded tae the neighbourin’ tRNA's amino acids, nae messing aboot.	5e846f1d51207b090e3794b670247f07	-1	-1
5	Initiating with mRNA's transition from the nucleus to the ribosome within cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum, protein synthesis proceeds by engaging tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid corresponding to mRNA codons. The process continues as each ribosome-bound tRNA molecule bonds its amino acid load to the growing peptide chain until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling termination of elongation and thus completing protein synthesis.	7b494ebfdfb7f646ed8f9cc531d64540	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences post mRNA's egress from the nucleus with the initiation phase, where a specific tRNA bearing an anticodon compatible to the mRNA's codon recognises this counterpart. The continuous attachment of amino acids, brought into position by corresponding tRNAs, ensues until the arrival at a STOP codon on the mRNA's A-site prompts termination, consequently concluding the elongation and protein synthesis process.	3fb46fa713ea7348c4140967333aeab0	-1	-1
5	Initiation commences with mRNA transporting genetic codes from the nucleus to the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum, forming a protein chain starting with a START codon in the P site.

5	The protein synthesis kicks off, as fast as greased lightning, with mRNA darting out of the nucleus carrying important genetic codes in triplets, or codons, read by rRNA.  Then, the tRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, recognises the complementary codon on the mRNA like a mate on the never never and carries corresponding amino acids which are bonded together with adjacent tRNA's amino acids to form a protein chain.	22639c11a852a3b928bf9ebf4f2685de	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, here's how it goes: mRNA, bless its heart, moseys on outta the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then things get busier than a moth in a mitten with new amino acids hitching a ride on tRNA and those rascals on the other side bonding with the neighboring tRNA's amino acids, like two peas in a pod. It's like one big, happy family reunion.	8b85327cdb7678072b0839b422bb5821	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA exits the nucleus, it is read in sets of three bases, known as codons, by rRNA. 2. Then, the appropriate amino acid is attached to the tRNA molecule. 3.

At this point, protein synthesis halts (elongation and termination), leaving a completed protein molecule.	6fe231fd69f7e366f2904e14b82f78f2	-1	-1
5	Okay, starting with mRNA leaving nucleus, four major steps in protein synthesis involve: (1) mRNA moves to ribosome where its codons are read. (2) tRNA carrying anticodon, that be matchy-matchy to mRNA codon, comes along. (3) Now, a start codon in P site signals for protein making to begin - this part we call initiation. (4) As more codons read by ribosome, new matching amino acids get added to the chain by tRNA. Them steps make we proteins.	7fb0bda1b56ebbf73fd94f0b781f526e	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or it enters via the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon reaching its location, the mRNA bases are interpreted in triplet groups known as codons by rRNA, then a tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon identifies and binds to the complementary codon of the mRNA, following the base pairing rules where U pairs with A and C pairs with G.	71991a5483222d668642e0b7684f71b3	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA, after being generated in the nucleus, goes out of nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it makes its way to the ribosome situated in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, during which an equivalent amino acid is attached to the tRNA, contributing to protein synthesis.	0165eb211d918c2bdc628001f02b6c4e	-1	-1

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, mRNA is transported to the ribosome where it's sequence of bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA in the ribosome, then corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring in specific amino acids that match each codon on the mRNA. As each new tRNA molecule binds to the mRNA, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain. Finally, as this process continues, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of each tRNA get bonded together, forming a polypeptide chain which then folds into a functional protein.	1b765bf134c25aa6bd94d3d02b9ea377	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis primarily involves four key steps: firstly, mRNA moves to a ribosome, functioning as a template for protein construction. Secondly, translation initiates when a tRNA molecule attaches to the start codon on the mRNA strand. A new related amino acid is then attached to this tRNA, constituting the third step. In the fourth and final step of this process, the relevant amino acids at the other side of each tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain. This chain continues to lengthen until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA within the A site, signalling the end of translation and thus, protein synthesis.	703e24d116fece85518546a8c1440401	-1	-1
5	Ferst off, mRNA beats it outta the nucleus through some nuclear pore, faster than a Sox fan chasin' a home run ball. Then this lil' guy called tRNA comes along, pickin' up new amino acids like a Southie dockworker loadin' a truck, until it hits this thing called a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, and that's when the party's done - coldah than a witch's tit in February.	98c2f42013903378c5dc71e05000d4b1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus like a veld fire, heading to the ribosome. There, tRNA with its anticodons matches up with the mRNA's codons as perfectly as water quenching Karoo-dry earth, forming the start of an amino acid chain. Like a dance, this linking of amino acids carries on quick-quick until it meets a stop sign in the form of a STOP codon, ending the assembly and releasing the finished protein.	9132a02e9349e168e19499d717f2eb76	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a process bigger than a prairie sky, commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read at a START codon in the P site, initiating the process by linking amino acids together to form a protein. As changeable as Maritime weather, this process continues with the addition of corresponding amino acids to the tRNA, while elongation and termination occur when a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted, ending the linkage of amino acids and consequently finalizing protein assembly.	137dfc19d02ef8252a7a639622f6720d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic information for protein assembly.

5	Sure, 'tis a quare complex process, this protein synthesis. Once mRNA gets the green light to leave the nucleus, it meets with tRNA that's as solid as the Rock of Cashel when it comes to recognizing its companion codon on the mRNA. The next bit hasn't changed in donkey's years - they start at the P site with a START codon, linking amino acids together like a dance at an Irish wedding, ending up with a newly made protein.	fc07975caa75500d7f247d765a669103	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart, you're askin' 'bout somethin' as intricate as findin' a needle in a haystack.

5	1. mRNA, after exiting the nucleus, first gets read in triplets named codons by rRNA, making sure language of DNA is well understood.  2. Next, a tRNA with a complementary anticodon recognizes and attaches to the mRNA's matching codon for correct translation.  3. This leads to amino acids being linked together until they encounter a STOP codon on the mRNA within the A site, a part of elongation process.  4. Finally, when the STOP codon is read, it brings about termination of this sequence, meaning the protein synthesis is complete.	3de3857bff6a0f19292b932e7e0a2485	-1	-1
5	Well now, once that mRNA escapes from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's like the starting gun at a county fair race. It's off to the ribosome, where tRNA starts lining up their corresponding amino acids, kind of like farmers at the feed store early mornin'. Then those amino acids get connected to the neighboring ones and before ya know it, a new amino acid is hitched onto the tRNA. It's a wild ride, for sure!	8306acb06467b5a6786bc9db9621e6d4	-1	-1

It then initiates protein construction by recognizing a START codon at the P site and linking amino acids together, with tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon that aligns with the mRNA's codon - isn't it fascinating how U pairs with A and C partners with G?	3aa1a46e1f02bb6dc815e1b858e41715	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has blossomed out from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, does it spark your curiosity to know that it is read in groups of three bases called codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA)? Isn't it fascinating that transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon, steps up to recognize and bind with it?	71bf6988ee634f035b013059c0dc31cb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the corresponding codon of the mRNA exiting the nucleus. This triggers the initiation phase where amino acids are connected starting from a START codon in the P site, and this linking process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is interpreted in the A site, signifying the elongation and termination stages.	52c8c57c1ac0a5103b4c24a51f59e3d0	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA slams the doah on the nucleus and hightails it right outta there through this thing called a nuclear pore. Next thing you know, these guys called amino acids on the tRNA staht bonding with their neighbors, kicking things off with this hotshot known as a START codon in the P site, and quicker than a Sox homerun, they're stringing together to make a protein. It's wicked smaht how it all works out.	ac2fd3d2aa46d89f85c15ed2caef4cdf	-1	-1
5	No problem, boet. So firstly, the mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus, right? Now begins the dance of life!  1. The first jol is called Translation Initiation: This is where the mRNA attaches itself to the ribosome like a hungry lion to a juicy steak. 2. Next up, we have Elongation, but it’s not as serious as it sounds. The tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon (think of it like the perfect dance partner) recognizes and pairs up with the corresponding codon on the mRNA, making them as inseparable as boerewors and braai. 3. Now we add a new step to our dance routine - each tRNA brings in a new amino acid, like adding members to a gumboot dance crew, all while maintaining rhythm with the mRNA codons.  4. Last but not least, we have Termination - no worries, nothing's ending! This is just when the corresponding amino acids on each tRNA bond together stronger than a Springbok scrum, forming a brand-new protein. And voila! That’s all, folks!	9b222304fb974141cc023f30d3562aed	-1	-1
5	Starting off as changeable as Maritime weather, mRNA slips out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys through the cytoplasm until it either hits a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, just like enduring a Yukon winter, the corresponding amino acids attached to the tRNA form bonds with neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids, creating a protein that's bigger than a prairie sky.	0837e4595474c23f2aebbc6085937db5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and migrating to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum located in the cytoplasm. The major steps involve translation where tRNA molecules bring in corresponding amino acids, creating polypeptide chains through a process of elongation until a stop codon on the mRNA is reached, signaling the termination step. At this stage, adjacent amino acids on tRNA are bonded together to form the final protein.	792b4877e1c098023360a52b1fc827f8	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA bides its time and then leaves the nucleus through this thing ca'd a nuclear pore. Next, there's this bit where a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA. Then, these wee amino acids keep getting joined together until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read - that's your elongation and termination for ye. It's all a grand dance of molecules, dinna you think?	b0f7fc9566aedbcf3b839c35ed15ef35	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus and moves towards the ribosome in cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next step is initiation, where a START codon in the P site signals the linking of amino acids to begin making a protein. This process continues during the elongation stage until a STOP codon in the A site is interpreted, indicating the termination point for that specific protein synthesis.	3a8358444356a782dc9a9e2794589d3d	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Beginning with the voyage of mRNA from the nucleus, the first crucial step in protein synthesis is the deciphering of mRNA's codons, which are groups of three bases, by rRNA. The second step involves tRNA, which possesses an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon - remember it follows U=A and C=G mapping. In the third step, each tRNA molecule recognizes and binds to its corresponding mRNA codon. Finally, in the fourth step, an appropriate amino acid is attached to each tRNA, setting the stage for the creation of a new protein.	25d7919ddb9f864ae0375d0e93388a37	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being recognised by tRNA, which carries a matching anticodon, isn't that intriguing? This anticodon recognises the complementary codon on the mRNA, and the corresponding amino acid is added to the growing chain, bonding to adjacent tRNA's amino acids - all part of an intricate and fascinating process.	bf6f8558936423792af69b94b7ceb516	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's delve into this fascinating process, shall we? The first step is that our mRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, makes its grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then this mRNA has its bases read in groups of three, known as codons, by none other than rRNA - a process bang on like decoding a secret message. Finally, just like paying for something on the never never, the corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA get bonded to the neighbouring tRNA's amino acids.	b9979f657c7e7e3d88113bcaaa76765e	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, it's a bit like this: That mRNA skips outta the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore, kind of like a young'n sneakin' out the back door. Then you've got your tRNA playin' matchmaker, carryin' the complementary anticodon that lines up just right with the mRNA's codon, like two peas in a pod. Finally, the amino acids hitched to the tRNA get all cozy-like, bondin' together to make a good ol' protein chain.	2b9f54d8b4e786baab3a5caddacf528f	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA first exits the nucleus through a structure called the nuclear pore. 2. Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA travels to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum for the next step of protein synthesis. 3. At this point, tRNA molecules which carry anticodons that are complementary to the codons on the mRNA come into play. 4. The tRNA recognizes and binds to its corresponding mRNA codon, effectively translating the genetic code into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein.	0fe360658f321fe76d534ef6ecf9209b	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA weh leave de nucleus travel through cytoplasm, reaching ribosome or going inside rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then tRNA carrying de complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) recognize de codon of mRNA and the amino acids on the other end of tRNA bond to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	c7288b2bb2c0451a7390a3a44f291bd5	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it voyages across the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in sets of three known as codons. The sequence continues with amino acids being bonded together until an A site on the mRNA reads a STOP codon, signifying the conclusion of elongation and termination.	357582d934bba4f850bea1e67bcf2f24	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm. Then, tRNA carrying the anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon identifies its counterpart on the mRNA. Following this, a corresponding amino acid is attached to the tRNA, contributing to protein synthesis.	2848c560cb335f3ad3e2951b6e9f485b	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the skinny. Once that mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's all about threading those amino acids together to whip up a protein, and that starts with a so-called START codon in this P site, don't ya know? Then, like bees to honey, a new matching amino acid gets added to the tRNA. So it's kind of like building a corn crib, one piece at a time.	b7a7323d775dcff80421a9a89f2e6028	-1	-1
5	Kicking off the show, mRNA scoots out the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, the tRNA, as clever as a fox, matches up with mRNA's codon like a jigsaw puzzle, using its anticodon. Next up, it's all about joining the dots - amino acids on tRNA get bonded together. It's a bit like a ceilidh dance – first you split, then you pair up and finally, you join in a line!	fd5b8e085bfbb3292a83b7442d372122	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA has exited the nucleus, it heads to the ribosomes where protein synthesis kicks off! A tRNA molecule recognises and pairs with the mRNA's codons, a new amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain, and this process continues like clockwork until a stop codon halts the party – thus bringing about elongation and termination of the protein chain.	cb6ca69e78de05e4fabfa1ec018de2f3	-1	-1
5	Post-nuclear exit, the mRNA with its vital information moves through the cytoplasm to link up with the ribosome or slides into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, getting ready for the protein assembly line. The rRNA within the ribosome deciphers the mRNA's coded message in trios of bases called codons, while tRNA, bearing anticodons complementary to these codons, steps up to align themselves correctly ensuring a perfect translation from nucleotide language to protein language.	48f2167240c2efbaec77c43938f9dbc5	-1	-1
5	With gusto, let's dive into the captivating world of protein synthesis! Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, the first major step sees it being diligently interpreted by rRNA in trios, affectionately termed 'codons'. Next, tRNA springs into action as a master codebreaker, identifying and binding to the complementary codon on the mRNA using its anticodon. The real showstopper is when a new amino acid, carried by the tRNA, gets added to the growing protein chain - this is when science truly becomes art!	6e969b6982f09d06604bb59f224479e8	-1	-1
5	Stepping out from the nucleus, our mRNA begins its adventure by voyaging through the cytoplasm to either rendezvous with a ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes the rRNA, reading the mRNA in triplets known as codons, while tRNA, carrying the anticodon - a mirror reflection of the codon - recognizes and latches onto its complementary mate on the mRNA. This intricate dance forms the backbone of protein synthesis, encapsulating its essence in these four major steps.	57284cfeff3f21111c8a4abf834b01fd	-1	-1
5	"No problem, pal. Once the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, quicker than a Sox fan chasin' a Fenway Frank, it gets down to business and starts protein synthesis. It kicks off with a START codon in the P site, hookin' together amino acids like they're stronger than a Southie dockworker. This keeps going, quieter than midnight in the Commons, until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site - that's when we know it's ""lights out"" for elongation and termination. This whole operation's slower than molasses in January, but it's how proteins get made!"	3d3db8c676cc8403128c4a03a0e88e85	-1	-1
5	Shap shap! Here's the scoop: firstly, the mRNA bounces off from the nucleus and takes a lekker trip through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then it gets things rolling with a START codon in the P site which initiates the linkage of amino acids to whip up a protein. This process, called elongation, carries on like a lekker braai until a STOP codon pulls in at the A site, putting a full stop to the linking of amino acids - that's when we call it termination. In a nutshell, that's how proteins are synthesized.	a63f162e69d8634cb51a9c91be92df35	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts in a hot as Toronto in July momentum with mRNA making a steady as a Canuck's resolve exit from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then treks through the cytoplasm and heads to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. To cap it off, heavy as a moose, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, which acts as the fundamental building block of our protein.	a2b0d195c07b2eb0be79696ffc20ec25	-1	-1
5	Here we go! So, the protein synthesis adventure begins as our main actor, mRNA, makes its glamorous exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Soon after, a performance of a lifetime unfolds in a process known as elongation and termination, where amino acids keep joining the party until a STOP codon on the mRNA says it's time to hit the brakes. During this mind-boggling process, amino acids at the tail end of a tRNA bond with their neighbors from an adjacent tRNA, creating a breathtaking chain of connection and unity. Honestly folks, it's nothing short of biochemical magic!	13723d7a57f72ce9c06ef39db5e3cbdb	-1	-1
5	Nae bother! So, the first step is that mRNA leaves the nucleus, heads through the cytoplasm, and finds its way to the ribosome or it gets inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, rRNA starts reading off the mRNA bases in groups of three, these wee groups are known as codons. Now, here's where it gets exciting: tRNA comes into play with its complementary anticodon (mind you, U pairs with A and C matches with G) and recognises the matching codon on the mRNA. There ye huv it, four major steps in protein synthesis.	b92235d8d1e8e13ffd5c195f011d9c32	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a thrilling journey through the cytoplasm, reaching its destination - the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here comes the exciting part – each tRNA molecule steps into action, adding a new corresponding amino acid to its chain, contributing to the grand assembly of protein synthesis.	662f1e0f5ce0b672b9accf5da6bfac4c	-1	-1
5	The captivating journey of protein synthesis commences with the mRNA making a grand exit from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, taking along the blueprint for our protein. As the next major move, the mRNA's bases are read in distinct triplets known as codons by none other than the rRNA; and then comes the tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, which ingeniously recognizes each mRNA codon - bear in mind that here U=A and C+G - adding up to this fascinating process of creating life's essential proteins.	a9a08c95aefd6f8f587f3be174a1aae7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when the mRNA leaves the nucleus to meet a START codon in the P site, triggering the assemblage of amino acids. tRNA, with its complementary anticodon, identifies the mRNA's corresponding codon and continues to connect amino acids until a STOP codon signals the termination of this process, successfully creating a protein.	f6aab47837e490b824bb934e21823e43	-1	-1
5	Bang on then, the mRNA does a runner from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, that's your first step. Then we're as busy as a one-legged man at a bum kicking contest, constantly linking up new amino acids to the tRNA until we hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call the A site - sure isn't that as solid as the Rock of Cashel?	94a8a91eba73d3c6350aaf71b860c1fb	-1	-1
5	Alright now, listen here. Post nucleus departure, this mRNA fella joins the party readin' bases in groups of three, what we call 'codons', courtesy of our good friend rRNA. Now these codons are just the ticket for tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon - makes it right easy to recognize its partner mRNA codon. With these paired up like two peas in a pod, amino acids start linking together non-stop till they run into a STOP codon on the mRNA, putting an end to our little hoedown. That's the long and short of it, y'all.	23d0f672f2ac50b302a8c9e58885076a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and the ribosome reading its bases in sets of three, known as codons. The process then initiates with a START codon in the P site, where subsequent amino acids are added to the tRNA, forming a protein chain.	5c9e2f7c2ab4dd5d7659917888f9d785	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA bases are read in groups of three called codons by rRNA. Second, protein creation begin with a START codon in the P site linking amino acids together. Thirdly, this linking (elongation) keeps going till a STOP codon on mRNA in the A site is read, which then ends the process (termination).	affafe2344baf83f7f9a4441acb03241	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, followed by tRNA recognizing and binding to complementary codon sequences on the mRNA. The process continues with amino acids being linked together based on these matches until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein elongation and triggering termination.	2c02c1da81e2768366028a70a5d35374	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with a tRNA recognizing and matching the mRNA's complementary codon. Following the START codon, amino acids are strung together, and these amino acids on each tRNA bond with those of adjacent tRNAs, forming a protein chain.	9fd3bf5d59d8a93683cdf7b2138459b3	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA has gotta scoot on outta the nucleus through a lil' gateway called a nuclear pore. Then the real magic starts when rRNA starts readin' the bases of that mRNA in groups of three, we call 'em codons. Now, here comes tRNA carryin' the opposite, or what us science folks call complementary anticodon, and it goes on to recognize that mRNA codon like two peas in a pod.	7c8ae4172c978d206bdc6adecbe26ca0	-1	-1
5	Well pal, protein synthesis kicks off wi' the mRNA headin' oot the nucleus and gettin' read in wee triples called codons by the rRNA. Then we're onto initiation where a START codon in the P site gets things movin', linkin' together amino acids tae form a protein, adding new matchin' ones to the tRNA as we go along.	28d7ed2ebdf23e3e607c89385e0f5815	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, after mRNA exits the nucleus, it's decoded in groups of three bases known as codons by rRNA. Following this, the corresponding amino acids linked to tRNA are bonded together, with this process of elongation continuing until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA strand in the A site, marking the termination phase.	5e618299050d4b6b65543c63b22338fa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where a START codon in the P site signals the start of amino acid linkage to form a protein. Following that, the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding mRNA codon, enabling its corresponding amino acids to be bonded with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, effectively building the protein structure.	27a4197c595506b92c4e5e43cfa2c7e1	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis begins. This process involves the tRNA receiving a new corresponding amino acid, which in turn becomes bonded to adjacent amino acids on other tRNA molecules, progressively building the resultant protein.	b54055b11b3abe8a13a81fe381c05858	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA navigates towards the ribosome located either in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein synthesis then initiates at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are successively linked together to form a protein.	971b8535263471728a55488f034754f6	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first off, the mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus way quicker than a car on the Pike, right? It's got this job to do - it's gotta start up protein synthesis, and that begins with a START codon in the P site where amino acids get linked together; think of it like the kick-off at a Pats game. Then those mRNA bases are read in triplets, or codons, by the rRNA - it's sharper than a Sox fan's wit. Lastly, we got these corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA bonding to the amino acids on adjacent tRNA - quieter than a midnight in the Commons but just as important.	936f88bf76456cf6eef3d61efc90021e	-1	-1
5	After making a quick-quick exit from the nucleus, the mRNA takes a journey to the ribosome or ducks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, just like a veld fire spreading fast. Then, like kids in a candy store, amino acids start linking together in the P site at a START codon, small-small creating a protein - that's initiation for you. This process carries on until a STOP codon pops up in the A site, then it's game over - that's elongation and termination sorted.	f8b7ca25304dccfa735a1b98e15606bd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, bigger than a prairie sky in its complexity, starts with mRNA departing the nucleus and being read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA, which is as swift as a Calgary wind, leading to the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA - hotter than Toronto in July.	8edb80530a171d539d694fb8a41c4d56	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and migrating through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where its bases are read in groups of three known as codons by rRNA. The process continues with tRNA translating each codon into its corresponding amino acid, which is then bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acid, constructing a polypeptide chain that folds into a protein.	010025cced93a06fade951297a1586c2	-1	-1
5	Aye, mRNA bides nae langer in the nucleus, makin' a swift exit through the nuclear pore. Then it's all hands on deck for the tRNA as it ropes in a new corresponding amino acid. Mind ye, these mRNA bases are read in groups o' three, or 'codons' if ye like, and that's all down to rRNA. This whole rigmarole is all part of the grand plan for protein synthesis.	fd93c4fa293db32c1bc9dbe7167f8f13	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis process begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, traveling via the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's codons are then read by tRNA molecules, with each tRNA carrying a specific amino acid that corresponds to its anticodon; these amino acids are joined in a chain until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached. This series of events, known as elongation and termination, ensures that the protein is synthesized correctly.	2859ecdd85945569423c9f373faf6d51	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and making its journey through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As it does, it's read by a tRNA molecule inside the ribosome, which then fetches the corresponding amino acids that are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This sequence continues until a STOP codon appears on mRNA triggering the cessation of the protein synthesis in what is known as elongation and termination phases.	7b6f2ca11fe08009c48ec8c49f37d883	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and entering the cytoplasm where it attaches to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next significant step is the addition of a matching amino acid to the tRNA molecule.	70efe07a0ae8a15fa88452e87cd234ef	-1	-1
5	'Course, the moment our friend mRNA pucks out of the nucleus, it's as fast as greased lightning through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like builders at tea time, amino acids start linking together to make a protein - all kicked off by a START codon in the P site. It's here that tRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with the complementary anticodon, recognises its partner in crime, the mRNA codon.	ec19de50c6e6f6433be7307ea0a8e921	-1	-1
5	Well now, y'all gotta picture this. That mRNA, it lit out from the nucleus, quick as a cat on a hot tin roof, passin' through that nuclear pore and heading straight for the ribosome or maybe the rough endoplasmic reticulum out in the cytoplasm. Then, quicker'n greased lightning, a fresh-as-a-daisy amino acid is hitched onto the tRNA. So there you have it, that's the dance of protein synthesis - complicated as a hog on ice but pretty as a peach when it all comes together.	bba8565536b9386fef22513fd58f6678	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA departs from the nucleus and moves to either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, it's important to note that the mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, which is facilitated by rRNA. The process of elongation occurs where amino acids keep getting connected until a 'STOP' codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	d64fdb137bda93f05a4545b1233b51ec	-1	-1
5	mRNA, after leaving nucleus, heads into cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. mRNA's bases, read as triplets named codons by rRNA, allow corresponding amino acids on tRNA to bond with neighboring tRNA's amino acids.	e75762d4b4313572bae99ffe014cd7a3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves crucial steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The first step involves the transfer RNA (tRNA) identifying and binding to the complementary codon of the mRNA, followed by a new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA. This process continues with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids forming bonds with their corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA, ensuring the formation of a protein chain.	c0816371afe5a19a85f393fd70520503	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA journeys to either the ribosome or rough endoploplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. In the final step, tRNA recognizes and carries the complementary anticodon, matching mRNA's codon.	6a206b767d03826e0aaedcbc47b6b862	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, once that mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the next step sees a fresh amino acid added to the tRNA. After that, the tRNA, holdin' onto the anticodon that matches up with the mRNA's codon (U for A and C for G), recognizes its pair on the mRNA.	1c75947dc22ea290928576b7552db9a5	-1	-1
5	After skippin' the nuclear border through a pore, mRNA takes a wee journey across the cytoplasm till it finds itself at the ribosome or bashes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, it's nae more than a sequence of amino acids linkin' up until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site - that's when the elongation and termination phase kicks in.	1cd4c3bdcd4da0e701bd5ab394674569	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves the recognition of mRNA's complementary codon by tRNA bearing the equivalent anticodon. Following this, a corresponding amino acid is appended to the tRNA. Finally, using a START codon in the P site as the initial point, these amino acids are sequentially linked together to form a protein.	fb34be1957ed1cb6359ee661e401775b	-1	-1
5	In the process of protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus and a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. Amino acids are successively linked, thanks to the instructions on the mRNA until a STOP codon is encountered, marking the end of the elongation and signalling for termination. The continuous bonding of adjacent tRNA's amino acids enables the formation of a protein.	814ee97dd5ddcfc102d8921ea0970eab	-1	-1
5	Initiating from the process of mRNA expulsion through the nuclear pore, the protein synthesis journey embarks. This is followed by rRNA reading the mRNA bases in triplets, termed as codons, before moving on to bond the relevant amino acids located at the other end to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, hence forming a protein chain.	1ceb37ec5bfb7a5838c452eb616d9d68	-1	-1
5	The initial stage of protein synthesis involves mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving through cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then proceeds with the initiation at the P site using a START codon, leading to amino acids being linked together to make a protein, and builds on adjacent tRNA's amino acids which are bonded correspondingly at the far end of each tRNA.	146f9a86bb98e91d76425befec757560	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first off, that mRNA sneaks outta the nucleus through this little thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then it's all about those amino acids gettin' strung together until they hit this STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site – that's your elongation and termination. Oh, and don't forget, those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, what we call codons, and all that's done by the rRNA. So there ya have it, four major steps of protein synthesis.	88ce9c4ed9d2895f561b09e7f5a9cdac	-1	-1
5	Starting small-small with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it dances along till it finds tRNA carrying an anticodon that fits together like bread and polony. Then, as high as the Drakensberg, tRNA's amino acids bond with their neighbours, a jol that carries on until a STOP codon on the mRNA shows its face in the A site, ending this protein synthesis party quick-quick.	94b462f1ae089b30f2b3d66bd48cfa4a	-1	-1
5	Commencing like a Calgary wind, the mRNA exits the nucleus and a tRNA, bearing an anticodon that mirrors the codon of the mRNA, recognizes this complementary sequence. Swiftly, akin to a Yukon winter's arrival, initiation occurs at a START codon in the P site where amino acids begin to connect, forming a protein and with each new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA as solid as Canadian Shield.	9d05dc58dc3025d4f1744a5a562f16f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA, carrying the genetic information, leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore to reach the cytoplasm. The mRNA bases are deciphered in codon triplets by rRNA during translation, and a corresponding amino acid is subsequently attached to each tRNA, building up the newly synthesized protein.	1ebe9818cf1629c0b9b540a416991e30	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA bounces oot the nucleus an toddles off through the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or mibbie sneaks intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, this rRNA reads the mRNA bases in sets o' three, whilk we ca' codons. Lastly, here comes the tRNA carryin' the anticodon that's a match wi' the mRNA's codon - keep in mind here that U is pairtnered wi' A, and C's with G.	ff65405266ef2ab77669152ad00dfc9d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore, protein synthesis proceeds with the recognition of mRNA's complementary codon by a tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon. The process continues with the linking of amino acids, guided by the tRNA-mRNA interaction, until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, marking the end of elongation and signifying termination.	c59c5251bad8f0b4145d0ce64d76b97a	-1	-1
5	Exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the mRNA migrates through the cytoplasm, ultimately docking on the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In these locations, a crucial step in protein synthesis occurs: the corresponding amino acids tethered to the tRNA form connections with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, creating peptide bonds that construct proteins.	8a4597178385e8ea3a854da75760a42e	-1	-1
5	Upon departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm, ultimately reaching its destination: the ribosome or possibly, the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process proceeds with tRNA exhibiting a complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) identifying the corresponding codon of the mRNA.	0831ed24be8576d0018f9d1b21f76374	-1	-1
5	Sure, it's a bit quare, but protein synthesis starts with mRNA legging it out of the nucleus. Next, like an otter’s pocket full of pebbles, tRNA lads line up their amino acids and they get bonded together. It all kicks off when a START codon in the P site says 'right lads, let's go' (that's initiation) and keeps on going until a STOP codon in the A site cries 'hold your horses' (elongation and termination). It's as rare as hen's teeth, but there you have it - that's how proteins are made.	b4c04f26527706159155e4097caa141c	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, I reckon it all starts with that mRNA scootin' out the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, like findin' a needle in a haystack, them amino acids start linkin' up real nice-like, until they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA, which is about as hard of a row to hoe as you can get.	41eaebef6afcb8ad6a46ad6fc03185af	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and then protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site, initiating the linkage of amino acids. The elongation continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination and concluding protein creation.	50563111728d39210b8c31bcc3f6ac9c	-1	-1
5	Alright, here we go. After mRNA done lef the nucleus through nuclear pore, it read by the rRNA in groups of three bases, we call them codons. Then, amino acids pon tRNA bond up with other amino acids pon nearby tRNA. This how we mek protein.	bd689244bccc4d33e0bc90a486425695	-1	-1
5	First, tRNA carrying the anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon recognizes and binds to it. Next, a new amino acid corresponding to the anticodon is attached to the tRNA, and then these amino acids are linked together to form a protein, beginning with a START codon at the P site during the initiation phase of translation.	651194bc3c8d803c3bc459ababfe126d	-1	-1
5	First, protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site where amino acids are linked together. Next, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon. The process of connecting amino acids persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is identified, marking elongation and termination.	0da6ad0c8ef7799aa5ea1593a8b46e49	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's how it works. Once that mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus, a tRNA molecule with a matching anticodon, like two puzzle pieces, you know, latches onto the mRNA codon. Now this tRNA's haulin' an amino acid with it, and this gets added to a growin' chain of these little guys. They keep addin' one after another, just as busy as a stump-tailed cow in fly time, until they run into a STOP codon on that mRNA. That's when they call it quits and you've got yourself a brand new protein.	283df8df8e64adb35bb90eb93a620ac7	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA bails oot the nucleus and its bases are read in groups of three, these are known as codons, by rRNA. Then up next, we've got amino acids that start getting strung together like linking sausages, kicking off with a START codon at the P site - this is what we call initiation. This process keeps on going until it hits a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site - that's your elongation and termination done and dusted. The end product? A protein, heavy as a lead balloon.	a1bcdd84a3043f5f6dae4ebde47adfa9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, which carries the genetic code from the DNA, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then in the cytoplasm, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, while transfer RNA (tRNA) bonds the corresponding amino acids together to form a protein.	f35bd1ef419b152259fa73bca8f82f84	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The process continues as corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA, and these amino acids are continuously linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, signifying the end of elongation and initiation of termination.	50f2e3801ecba91325f0932262fe530c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. This process initiates at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are linked together to form a protein, with the corresponding amino acids on the end of the tRNA bonding to adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	cb8f43784fe663b1c2e0c5040c26ec58	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, proceeding to the ribosome where the transfer RNA (tRNA) recognises and binds to its specific codon. This triggers the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, which then forms peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids on the neighbouring tRNAs, creating a growing polypeptide chain.	ca3054517582ea14913a3e6f34932311	-1	-1
5	Aight, so here's how it goes down: First off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through this little thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then, a new amino acid that matches up is tacked onto the tRNA, and finally, the rRNA reads off the mRNA bases in groups of three, which we call codons.	7ea7da29c386aa11def60332f66c905f	-1	-1
5	Eish, this process is as slow as a wet week but let's break it down. After the mRNA says cheers to the nucleus, it takes a trek through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or gets into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a leopard recognising its spots, tRNA carrying the matey anticodon picks up on the mRNA's complementary codon. From there, the amino acids keep linking small-small till they spot a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call the A site – that's when we know this long journey of elongation and termination is finally klaar.	cc8b9fee6c4cf1454bf4ddb1bcecf75e	-1	-1
5	After mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's as heavy as a moose with all the information for protein synthesis. Then, like a prairie sky growing bigger with each passing cloud, corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA which are then bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids as solid as the Canadian Shield, marking the major steps in protein synthesis.	5362f59d78f00e96caa56a4a123e212c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and moving through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, new matching amino acids are attached to the tRNA, after which these amino acids are assembled into a protein starting with a START codon at the P site - this is known as initiation.	ebdb90f763f33a89f589f4165f15dbee	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA skelps oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore an traipses intae the cytoplasm tae reach the ribosome or it might go intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), recognises the complementary codon o' the mRNA.	9152bc0157ad0bf97371b82093c8c6fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in codon triplets by rRNA. Then, tRNA transports the corresponding amino acids using anticodons which pair with these complementary mRNA codons, leading to the formation of a protein chain until a STOP codon is encountered, thus ending the process.	1b93719322457c338e94066d1f07ecf8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA, which carries genetic information from the DNA, exits the nucleus and is read in sets of three bases known as codons by rRNA. The process kicks off with a START codon landing in the P site, triggering tRNA to identify and bind to complementary anticodons in the mRNA, thus leading to the sequential linking of amino acids to form a protein.	c9ab7b63eb803fc4b53c066b033a7d00	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and its bases are then read in groups of three, commonly referred to as codons, by the rRNA. The process continues with amino acids linking together until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and initiation of termination.	502d8190f152addb7590463e2e420093	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA, like a hare in a meadow, leaps from the nucleus carrying the genetic code in sets of three bases known as codons. The tRNA then steps up to the plate, acting as a matchmaker between the mRNA codons and their complementary anticodons, and ushers in the amino acids for a dance. This grand ceilidh keeps going, linking amino acids in a chain longer than O'Connell Street, until a STOP codon puts an end to it all, like a wet day at the Galway races.	a1e82fe44e6e82b1671c8c4690d1561c	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it's like this: First off, mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus and sets course to the cytoplasm, aiming for the ribosome or moseys on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA brings in new amino acids that match up with mRNA like a Sunday hat at church. These amino acids get hitched together end to end, kinda like a good ol' Southern conga line.	47e27d459839c8ef2a31a7b2f9ecbeac	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA, containing sets of three bases known as codons, exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then, these codons are interpreted by rRNA and the corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond together with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, kickstarting protein synthesis.	2984473cb355e114bf0a614636e786e2	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leave nucleus, it go cross cytoplasm till it reach ribosome or it go inside rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA read mRNA bases in groups of three we call codons. Amino acids then start link up together forming a protein starting with a START codon at the P site - that's what we call initiation.	32d077fd939faf33119dcd651bb74393	-1	-1
5	After mRNA excitingly escapes the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it is greeted by tRNA that carries the complementary anticodon, recognizing its complementary codon as a long-lost friend. This reunion results in a magical bonding of adjacent amino acids on tRNA, paving the way for protein synthesis!	c8b68ed24c55dc3c35271f769fc2a65f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, taking genetic instructions to the ribosomes. With the START codon in the P site marking initiation, amino acids are then added to tRNA, and eventually linked together to form a protein.	3b36629433ad28f74f974ca2b313170c	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, let's dive right in! So after mRNA skips outta the nucleus, it gets read in triplet bunches called codons by rRNA in the ribosome. Then, new amino acids get hitched to tRNA molecules and these amino acids are bonded to their neighbors on other tRNA molecules. It's kinda like a chain gang where each link has a job to do.	34523c44554ed4617b0a20b8686f6649	-1	-1
5	Let's kick off wi' mRNA scarpering fae the nucleus through a nuclear pore, nae wind, nae wave. Then it's ontae initiation, where amino acids start linking together at the START codon in the P site, as round as a pease they go.  They dinnae halt until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site during the elongation and termination stages, ending up as thin as a rake, making up our protein.	cbaccf2a78833652380624ece06cb495	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departing from the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is when rRNA reads the bases on the mRNA in groups of three, known as codons. Then, tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognise these codons and bind to them. Each tRNA molecule brings along a specific amino acid, which are then connected to adjacent amino acids by peptide bonds, forming a polypeptide chain. This chain will fold into a functional protein, marking the completion of protein synthesis!	6def5a5a982ba5cef2c4ae990ab5e54a	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it attaches to a ribosome where tRNA molecules match their anticodons to the mRNA's codons, bringing along corresponding amino acids. As the ribosome continues down the mRNA strand, amino acids are bonded together until a STOP codon is read, marking the end of protein synthesis.	5911b66ec8172697f3dd0e5a219b79c9	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis kicks off with the initiation phase where amino acids are connected starting with a START codon in the P site. This is followed by the tRNA identifying the complementary codon of the mRNA using the anticodon (U=A, C+G), and eventually, these corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, propelling us forward in this fascinating process!	d24f09bd97f3e50f6228573c5cc64313	-1	-1
5	Following its exit from the nucleus, mRNA journeys into the cytoplasm where it is either seized by a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the tRNA and its corresponding amino acids bind together and then to their neighbouring tRNA's amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that continues to grow until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, marking an end to this remarkable protein synthesis process.	94ab5746df47c3c4479da093f2c6869a	-1	-1
5	A'ight, so it all kicks off when the mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then these things called amino acids start linking up quicker than Sox fans at Fenway, all starting with this thing called a START codon in the P site - that's initiation for ya. Once that’s rolling, here comes the tRNA packing the complementary anticodon and recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA - like findin’ your car in a packed lot after a Pats game!	afb7df2e9e8b608ef764211babf3414f	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, when mRNA pulls an all-nighter and leaves the nucleus high as the Drakensberg, it totters quick-quick through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum like a veld fire. It kicks off a jol with the first START codon at the P site — that's when amino acids start linking together in a shisa nyama of protein synthesis (initiation). This mayhem continues until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site like an unexpected policeman at a roadblock, bringing this whole party to a stop (elongation and termination).	979604f14857c1558c33ac0dc9de17f1	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Alright, so protein synthesis starts off swift as a Calgary wind when mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It's here where it meets up with its trusty sidekick, the ribosome. Now, this process is as complex and tight as a beaver's dam, but let me break it down for you in four major steps: 1. In a step known as transcription, the DNA unwinds and RNA polymerase helps to create a complementary mRNA transcript. This is essentially like creating a blueprint from the DNA. Once transcribed, this mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Next comes translation. Here, the mRNA works with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the cytoplasm where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons - it’s not unlike reading Morse code! 3. Now remember those transfer RNAs (tRNAs) we mentioned earlier? They're about to play a big part in this Maritime weather-changeable process. Each tRNA carries an anticodon that recognizes and binds to its complementary codon on the mRNA. 4. Lastly, each tRNA also carries an amino acid that matches its anticodon. When it pairs up with the mRNA at the ribosome, these amino acids are bonded together to form a growing protein chain, shifting gears faster than mountain weather changing in Banff!	a16d2a80777497e92b2128b7872497ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is an exhilarating adventure that begins with mRNA daringly exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey through the cytoplasm to meet either the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In a climactic twist, tRNA - carrying the complementary anticodon - heroically recognizes the complementary codon of mRNA, propelling forward this incredible biological process!	672232799bcee1262fc8cf54a56a6918	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA bides its farewell tae the nucleus via the nuclear pore, setting off on a grand journey towards protein synthesis. The next step is like starting a new chapter wi' the START codon in the P site, where amino acids start to bind thegither, kick-starting the process of building a protein. This goes on until a new matching amino acid gets added to the mix by the tRNA, contributing to this complex and vital process.	33b84a52fa860c227708269abc26b9f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, and its codons being deciphered by rRNA in triplets. Following this, tRNA carrying anticodons complementary to mRNA's codon duly recognizes it, leading to the linking of amino acids, thus initiating protein creation at a START codon in the P site.	b2935856b35ac9776e782c95604a338b	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's grand departure from the nucleus, the first crucial step in protein synthesis is the recognition of mRNA's codon by tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon, a beautiful example of nature's balance. Then comes the thrilling moment where the amino acids on one end of the tRNA form robust bonds with their adjacent counterparts on another tRNA, effectively building a chain. This process persists, adding link after link, until they encounter a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, signaling an end to elongation and commencement of termination - thus completing this remarkable feat of molecular choreography that results in protein synthesis.	1db271136d73006ae9759eed2b917687	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a thrilling journey that begins with mRNA waltzing out of the nucleus to be read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. An amino acid orchestra then plays, with each tRNA musician adding a new corresponding tone until the final note - a STOP codon on the mRNA is hit, bringing an end to this harmonious sequence and thus completing protein synthesis.	b75d84f524b0276e52b17c80692b33b6	-1	-1
5	"Well, to kick things off on the never never, the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus and takes a dander through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or might even nip into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, there's this quare game of match-making where each tRNA pairs its amino acid with its mates in a chain until an arseways STOP codon on the mRNA says ""Enough!"" and calls time on the whole process."	f5a52f7dadef243982f6c3d51481c835	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it starts off with that mRNA skedaddling from the nucleus through a little door called a nuclear pore. Then, that mRNA's bases are read in bunches of three – like peas in a pod - these are called codons by your rRNA. We ain't done yet, cause next those corresponding amino acids on the tail end of the tRNA tie the knot with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. So it's all about communication and things stickin' together like glue, you see?	de0a6ef7550a33a155432d8edef1b37d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information to the ribosome and the first codon (START) positions amino acids. The elongation phase then proceeds, where mRNA's triplet codes or codons are interpreted by rRNA and translated into specific amino acids, which are bonded together in a sequence by tRNA's transfer of corresponding amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain or protein.	c558d18016fe77d2dfb2276794aba788	-1	-1
5	When mRNA done lef the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it tek a journey go through the cytoplasm headin' to the ribosome or it jus' go into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the amino acids weh deh pon one end of the tRNA, dem get bond up with the amino acids weh deh close by pon a next tRNA.	a2930f85d23826528bc385b1cf980972	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, and then travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During translation, tRNA matches up with the mRNA's codons, leading to the addition of a new corresponding amino acid, effectively building the protein.	b1c125bbaa98b9c6e1adc36e146ef6cf	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus via nuclear pore, then it journeys through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Lastly, amino acids are linked continually until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, marking the end of elongation and termination.	8eee2cf8c912df580742f91561205b77	-1	-1
5	Well, you start off with the mRNA headin' outta the nucleus and gettin' read in groups of three, known as codons, by somethin' called rRNA. Then, a molecule named tRNA, carryin' what we call an anticodon, recognizes its matchin' mRNA codon and brings along the right amino acid which gets hitched to the amino acid on the neighboring tRNA. It's like pairing up dance partners at a hoedown!	66c7ab19a6d7aefe97f4efbe3964c272	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA takin' a wee journey fae the nucleus to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, cruisin' through the cytoplasm. The next steps involve matchin' a brand-new amino acid to the tRNA and keepin' this up until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signalin' time to stop linkin' amino acids together - that's your elongation and termination right there.	9e31607c96a01bc9c9636268e2a48dca	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the process. It then proceeds with the linking together of amino acids into a protein chain, starting with a START codon in the P site, and continues by adding a new corresponding amino acid to each tRNA.	139a9dbe2aff4833fb717b609da7ea03	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizing the corresponding codon of the mRNA. This triggers a chain reaction where amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond to adjacent ones, continuing until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, terminating the elongation process.	ae68b96b47b965712da4cf522ff8f4f8	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA, having left the nucleus, pairs with a complementary tRNA anticodon in a process where U pairs with A and C pairs with G. Following this, the amino acids located on the other end of the tRNA form connections with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids. Finally, these linked amino acids initiate protein synthesis by aligning with a START codon at the P site, thus constructing the desired protein.	b78f4ef94c99bb4e25d83b50aea8fd82	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it voyages to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, rRNA reads the mRNA bases as triplets known as codons, leading to the formation of bonds between adjacent amino acids present on different tRNAs.	5dbaa87dbc7e3d91c6ea9fb393df352f	-1	-1
5	Alright, so picture it like this: our buddy mRNA, right outta the nucleus, takes a stroll through the cytoplasm, headin' for the ribosome or maybe the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where things get a bit more involved, each of those tRNA fellas grabs onto a new amino acid. Now these ain't just hangin' out here, they're getting linked together to build a protein, kickin' things off with a START codon in what we call the P site.	7a3267c14d895edbdcf45d6c4b373064	-1	-1
5	Sure, no worries. So, it starts with the mRNA taking a gap-year from the nucleus via the nuclear pore. Then our chommie tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, spots the matching codon on the mRNA like a Springbok finding a gap in the All Blacks' defence. This sets off the party at the P site, kicking things off with a START codon and building a lekker protein by chaining amino acids together. It's high as the Drakensberg, strong as a lion and just like how a leopard doesn't change its spots, this process is consistent in making proteins.	4f6ce091a787edf4b6dc247e0286f8bf	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA, as steady as a Canuck's resolve, departs from the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. After this, it engages in a process hot as Toronto in July where tRNA adds a corresponding amino acid. As changeable as Maritime weather, these corresponding amino acids on the far end of the tRNA bond with neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids, effectively forming the backbone of protein synthesis.	9f59d8a437657d7bc01b6b9ac32f3f84	-1	-1

The process does nae stop until there's a STOP codon spotted on the mRNA in the A site, which signals the end o' amino acids linkin', a part we ken as elongation and termination.	0c9ff16a30f89e11149087642c5ddab8	-1	-1
5	1. After leaving the nucleus, mRNA embarks on a journey, traversing the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or penetrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum, setting the stage for protein synthesis.  2. Then comes the tRNA, armed with the complementary anticodon, which identifies the mRNA's contrasting codon in an intricate dance of genetic codes.  3. The next act unfolds with amino acids being ceaselessly joined together, creating a rapidly lengthening chain. 4. This remarkable process persists until a STOP codon appears at the A site on the mRNA, signaling an end to this phase and laying down the final curtain on elongation and termination.	8bc37376d4a0d76ac073800143a930ec	-1	-1
5	Venturing from the nucleus, the mRNA embarks on a journey into the cytoplasm where it meets charming tRNA molecules, bearing complementary anticodons that recognize mRNA's codons in a dance as old as life. The ballet begins with a START codon securing its position in the P site, triggering a cascade of amino acids to be added onto the growing protein chain, each paired to their respective tRNA molecule, thus stringing together the beads of life - our protein.	484c5b8ff422cb67aea1f0929d6925f7	-1	-1
5	Once our herald, the mRNA, embarks on its noble journey from the nucleus, it soon encounters rRNA inside a ribosome where its message is deciphered in trios of bases called codons. Now, the stage is set for the initiation - the assembly of an amino acid chain at a start codon in the P site. The player in this act? tRNA - bringing appropriate amino acids to match each codon, diligently creating links between adjacent amino acids. Thus unfolds the final act - elongation and bonding of these amino acids into a magnificent chain, the protein itself, marking the triumphant conclusion of protein synthesis.	2316e3c79dbfb1d09b4fd26cf9e0ede3	-1	-1
5	After donkey's years in the nucleus, our mRNA is chomping at the bit and finally makes its great escape through a nuclear pore. Then, sure as the Rock of Cashel, it gallops across to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where like a well-practiced Irish jig, it starts off with a START codon in the P site to get the show on the road - linking amino acids together to form a protein as neatly and accurately as you could bang a nail on the head.	f3354b8213735e4d8e0894b86b372658	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, here's how it shakes out. The mRNA bids the nucleus adieu through a nuclear pore, then it's a hoedown between the mRNA and rRNA, with the mRNA's codons--that's groups of three bases--calling the tune. In comes tRNA, carrying the matching anticodon (where U pairs with A, and C gets cozy with G) which recognizes its dance partner in the mRNA's codon. It's a complex do-si-do, but that's the gist of protein synthesis.	941d95acc65938ee030ccd7e7851602f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, paving the way for the next crucial step. This involves an introduction of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA and subsequently, these corresponding amino acids present on the opposite end of the tRNA are effectively bonded with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a chain that becomes the protein.	c7cf643770b7db432780145977569c7b	-1	-1
5	First, protein synthesis commence with a START codon in the P site where amino acids bind together (we call dat initiation). Den a tRNA wey got de complementary anticodon (U fi A, C fi G) identify de matching codon of the mRNA. Amino acids keep linking up till dem see a STOP codon pon de mRNA inna de A site (dat part a elongation and termination).	501cc0c84ac239eae3b03024d5a2f7f5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and proceeding to the ribosome, where an appropriate START codon triggers the initiation phase - it's here that amino acids are linked to one another. This chain formation progresses as each new tRNA adds its corresponding amino acid to the growing protein strand, facilitated by a robust bonding process between adjacent tRNA molecules until a protein is formed.	46bba9f1538b287f2ae5a323cf7f31e7	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four main steps. First, mRNA reaches the ribosome, where the process begins. Second, tRNA with a corresponding anticodon identifies the complementary codon on the mRNA. Third, a matching amino acid is added to the tRNA. Lastly, this amino acid bonds with adjacent ones carried by other tRNA molecules, forming a protein chain.	9180f3436156768d6bac7a68d92cd0a2	-1	-1
5	You bet, so first off, that mRNA gets a move on outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then some tRNA with matching anticodons (we're talking U=A and C+G here) spots the right codon on the mRNA and latches on. End of the day, the amino acids hitched to these tRNA get cozy and bond with the ones next door. This here's how you get proteins built up in your body, pretty nifty if you ask me.	880764c622132ab424d17f49ac020ae4	-1	-1
5	Crackin' off, mRNA scoots right oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Next it's the grand dance of protein synthesis kicking off with a START codon in the P site linking up amino acids – that’s your initiation step, ken? Then, our chum mRNA takes a read of these bases in a triplet patter called codons, all this orchestrated by another mate, rRNA.	33dc472dce55e2bcecd4d78c3ba6f266	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rRNA then interprets the mRNA's base sequences in triplets known as codons, linking amino acids in a specific order until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of this elongation phase and termination of protein synthesis.	1687fda9452dbc967bec15bd2bcf7c71	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying the genetic information from the nucleus, migrates to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The synthesis process involves rRNA reading the mRNA codons (groups of three bases) and links amino acids together, starting from a START codon positioned in the P site, to construct a protein.	32371642693ec016cc5bc706e4d42e5c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing translation at the ribosome, where each codon matches with a specific tRNA carrying an amino acid. This process persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals termination, during which time each new amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain by forming bonds with adjacent amino acids also brought by tRNAs.	a799a9a10a4c7ebe67697a0922092670	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a complex yet captivating process, commences as the mRNA, encoded with genetic instructions, departs from the nucleus and embarks on its journey across the cytoplasm until it finds solace within the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the genetic code from the mRNA in triplet sequences known as codons, prompting the tRNA to align their complementary anticodons with these codons and thereby linking the corresponding amino acids together, creating a chain which ultimately forms the protein.	824d0aa468ec5e55d1801b5b84ae440f	-1	-1
5	Alroight, so fuhst off, that mRNA scoots right on outta the nucleus, headin' through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or duckin' into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, tRNA packed with its complementary anticodon - ya know, U's with A's, C's cozyin' up to G's - steps in and spots its match on the mRNA. Then we're on to those amino acids hitchin' a ride on the tRNA - they link up like best buds at Fenway, bondin' to the sidekick amino acid of the neighboring tRNA. It's wicked smaht how it all works out.	13f965f64da289793bb2a1ef92280d85	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, the process starts with mRNA making an exit from the nucleus, strong as a lion. The mRNA then high as the Drakensberg, attaches to the ribosome where the tRNA fetches and drops off new corresponding amino acids which are linked together, dry as the Karoo, until they come upon a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. This repetitive action of fetching and adding amino acids continues, like a taxi doing its rounds, until there's a full stop - ending the elongation and triggering termination.	aeb2fca105c5a8c18432765114c5ca59	-1	-1
5	First off, like a puck kicked off an ice hockey match, the protein synthesis starts with amino acids getting linked together at the START codon in the P site, initiating a process as steady as a Canuck's resolve. Then, akin to how a beaver would meticulously assemble its dam, the mRNA bases are read tightly in triplets known as codons by rRNA. After that comes the critical stage where the corresponding amino acids on the flip side of the tRNA are bonded to neighbouring tRNA's amino acids, a task as focused and heavy as a moose navigating through thick forests.	14f02ccc025b53224c9b8fcd959c3b8f	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins as the mRNA departs from the nucleus and traverses through the cytoplasm to arrive at either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by the translation process where a corresponding amino acid is coupled onto the tRNA. Subsequently, the amino acids are linked together in a chain, a process known as elongation, which continues until a stop codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, signaling termination. This results in the formation of a unique protein structure.	533796de5935337563bd27ed5a25cd04	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA bides its time till it finds a tRNA wi' the complementary anticodon, matching up like pieces in a jigsaw. Then the amino acids carried on the back o' the tRNA get linked up ane by ane, buildin’ a chain, until the mRNA shouts 'halt!' when it reads a STOP codon.	de8db09609de14ab1ca203d443a34a72	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is its journey into the cytoplasm and towards the ribosome or its entry into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The following critical step is initiation where a START codon positioned in the P site prompts the beginning of linking amino acids to construct a protein. Subsequently, an appropriate amino acid is attached to each tRNA molecule, facilitating the creation of a specific sequence that will eventually result in a unique protein.	c25f6540ab1d0ee2e1a53426bac87df6	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm, and finding its destination either at the ribosome or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The initiation of protein formation is signaled by a START codon in the P site which triggers the linking of amino acids to compose a protein, and crucially involves tRNA; each tRNA carries a specific amino acid, and as it aligns with its corresponding codon on the mRNA, these amino acids bond together, forming a chain that eventually becomes a complete protein.	da479f02dc48702473826ecea256861c	-1	-1
5	Starting from the nucleus, mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, guided by an intricate blueprint of base triplets known as codons. It is here where the symphony of protein synthesis begins, as rRNA reads these codons and heralds the initiation of protein construction at the START codon in the P site, creating chains of linked amino acids that will ultimately form proteins.	86beba0c667a462a51d34334ee1d0563	-1	-1
5	Well, the first part of this yarn involves mRNA making a swift exit from the nucleus quicker than greased lightning, using what we call a nuclear pore. Then it's no rest for the wicked, as it darts off through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Talk about being as busy as a bee! Soon after, amino acids start stringing together faster than you can say Jack Robinson, kicking off with a START codon in what we call the P site - and that, my friend, is how proteins are made, neat as a new pin.	3832d0df91a44455b4c4db8760f5073b	-1	-1
5	Well, now, let me tell ya. Once that mRNA skips outta the nucleus, it's like a country dance--first, the tRNA partner recognizes its match on that mRNA codon slicker than a greased pig. Then, an amino acid gets added to our tRNA fella, kinda like pickin' up a partner for the next dance. They keep on dancin' and linkin' till they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site - that's when the music stops. It's a smooth reel from start to finish, but takes longer than January molasses.	45307d0f20b980da7d5e6fee5fc8bcd1	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, having left the nucleus, is read by rRNA in groups of three bases known as codons.  2. The tRNA with a matching anticodon aligns itself to the mRNA's complementary codon, following the pairing rules of U=A and C=G. 3. Finally, the amino acids attached to each tRNA link together, forming a growing chain that later folds into a protein.	9b557484cd21c7f49b8fd63d56e32a17	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then through cytoplasm it reach ribosome or get inside rough endoplasmic reticulum. Amino acids, them bond to their own tRNA, also bond together to form a protein starting with a START codon in the P site, we call that initiation.	e704fee49ccffb3d7c6bf9f8db549ae9	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA exits nucleus, read by rRNA in triplets called codons.  2. Protein synthesis starts with START codon at P site, linking amino acids together. 3. This process continues until STOP codon is read on mRNA at A site, ending the linking of amino acids.  4. Resulting in creation of protein from linked amino acids.	41ec7ec7c16194b1ae8ba00836f4da21	-1	-1
5	Well, you start off with that mRNA scootin' out of the nucleus. Then, tRNA, sorta like a puzzle piece, finds its match on the mRNA. It's carryin' amino acids, which get linked together in a long chain. Now this hoedown keeps goin’ until a STOP sign (or a stop codon) shows up on the mRNA. At that point, we're done and you've got yourself a brand new protein.	d7b9aaa25848d5012e59bf9ead8e4867	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA stravaigs out the nucleus, protein synthesis kicks off - that's yer initiation. A tRNA carrying the right anticodon spots the matching codon on the mRNA, a process as exact as a game of snap. Then we're onto elongation and termination; amino acids get strung together like a line of washing till they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA. Protein synthesis is done and dusted when we've got a full line of linked amino acids.	e5a2b882b6bcee471cab24e787f3c3da	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, recognised by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. The tRNA adds a new corresponding amino acid, which then bonds with the amino acids of adjacent tRNAs, forming a protein chain.	35c5d593d6d5f199c5466689b69c8ca5	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA first departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, rRNA reads mRNA's base sequences in sets of three, called codons, as the mRNA navigates through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum.	680dfd80d2926563b49f454db8894064	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, transcribed from DNA in the nucleus, leaves the nucleus carrying codons or sets of three bases, which are read by rRNA. From there, the initiation phase starts with a START codon in the P site and continues to link amino acids together to form proteins. This process of elongation carries on until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, marking the termination phase of protein synthesis.	631928ba53d68578cb035d2232ba9750	-1	-1

5	First off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, hitchin' a ride through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, this little guy called tRNA—carrying the anticodon, mind you—pairs up with the matching codon in the mRNA, kinda like finding your car in a crowded Fenway lot. Then, these amino acids start linking together faster than cars on Storrow Drive during rush hour, continuing this dance until a STOP codon shows up in the A site of the mRNA—this here's your elongation and termination steps.	efb9fb40c563a28fb3926a95b9d00095	-1	-1
5	When mRNA jols from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it gets read in batches of three called codons by its cousin, rRNA.

5	Well, let me tell ya, it's like a well-choreographed dance. First off, that mRNA scoots out the nucleus faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, findin' its way through a nuclear pore. Then we got tRNA, carryin' the opposite (U=A, C+G) anticodon, and it recognizes the complementary codon of that mRNA like they're two peas in a pod. The final act is them amino acids keep gettin' linked together till a STOP codon on that mRNA is read in the A site - this part's tougher than a hard row to hoe, but it's pivotal for the whole process. It's called elongation and termination, y'all! So there you have it, four main steps of protein synthesis.	82bfa19ead538198018439a244901b2b	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, the process of protein synthesis involves four significant steps. First, the mRNA moves through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, in what is known as initiation, amino acids begin to link together starting with a START codon located in the P site. This chain of amino acids continues to grow until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read within the A site, marking the stages of elongation and termination, ultimately resulting in a newly synthesized protein.	1d72471b2ae769e744d2b3e140c0a79b	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA depart from nucleus through nuclear pore. Secondly, matching amino acids on opposite end of tRNA join to nearby tRNA’s amino acids. Finally, connection of amino acids continue till STOP codon read pon mRNA in A site, this process name elongation and termination.	8f5d329ff11cde8eaebbaad920cfce58	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. The process is further facilitated by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, which recognizes and binds to the complementary codon of the mRNA.	ce76b22bcf0b38ae49a67ffbb682b272	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.

Then, ya got your tRNA bringin' in new amino acids, and those get hitched right on to the chain with the others, makin' a protein faster than a jackrabbit in July.	a9994e4a3924dec4c800bf90f5dca9ba	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, as damp as a dungeon, makes its escapade from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, racing towards the ribosome. Then, tRNA, holding the right anticodon - ye know, like U=A and C=G - lines up with the matching codon on the mRNA, in a dance as choreographed as a ceilidh, adding on a new amino acid like mony a mickle maks a muckle.	d2b5e0d4b7e5539cb9a6b84593582ddc	-1	-1

This interaction aids in the formation of a peptide bond between adjacent amino acids on the tRNA, culminating in a protein.	19ff89df20e0f79b537adc16c9fd2539	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the protein synthesis process proceeds to involve the transfer RNA (tRNA) recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA.

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiates the process by linking amino acids together to form a protein at the start codon situated in the P site. As this process continues, corresponding amino acids are incorporated into the expanding polypeptide chain via transfer RNAs (tRNAs).	98f6bbe4ce4308c1cd79d8f6fa76c234	-1	-1
5	Alright, bub. We're startin' with our mRNA buddy leavin' the nucleus, right? So first thing's first, we got this whole initiation phase where a START codon in the P site gets things rollin' by kickstartin' the linkage of amino acids to make a protein, kinda like how the Sox start off a game at Fenway. Then, new corresponding amino acids get added on to the tRNA, smaller than a clam's hindquarters but crucial as all heck. Finally, these corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids-- slower than molasses in January, but hotter than a T platform in August when it comes to buildin' that protein.	53c4394b3c4441e8abd82193131fe7d8	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus like a veld fire, protein synthesis begins when mRNA, as dry as the Karoo, moves through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or find its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, mRNA's code, read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, guides the addition of specific amino acids during elongation until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, leading to termination; essentially, it all happens quick-quick.	91cb6dc1ff8687154cb1de84dc02009f	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis kicks off with a tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon recognizing and binding to the complementary codon of the mRNA.

Then, the specific amino acids attached to one end of each tRNA molecule bond to adjacent amino acids on neighboring tRNA molecules, consequently adding a new corresponding amino acid to the growing peptide chain.	19b3847052039fd7d568afe46e4b99b9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA.

5	Kicking off with mRNA hightailing it out of the nucleus as fast as greased lightning, there's a quare intricate process ahead. Our old friend tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognises the matching codon of the mRNA, and with that, a brand new corresponding amino acid is added to the mix. Then, these amino acids start linking together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site, and they've been at this game donkey's years!	f822961b605959c0ba36487fc2355412	-1	-1
5	Well, the whole process kicks off when that mRNA escapes the nucleus and meets rRNA, which reads its bases in groups of three, kinda like words in a sentence. Then, it's smoother than butter on a biscuit: we get a START codon in the P site marking where we begin stringing those amino acids together to build us a protein. We just keep on that track, adding more amino acids until an ol' STOP codon in the A site tells us we're done. It's about as hard as herding cats, but that's how you get proteins!	c0c0994b5a8ba84b0f2251541ec7e051	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying genetic codes in triplets known as codons, departs from the nucleus and is interpreted by rRNA.

The process of constructing a protein progresses by initiating at a START codon found in the P site where amino acids are linked together, and this continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	ef852cddef3071d501c906cbb2f8c715	-1	-1
5	Sure, the first step of this dance starts off with our mRNA leaving the nucleus and heading for a ribosome - it's like a letter on the never never, except it actually arrives!

The protein synthesis then commences with the initiation at a START codon in the P site, causing amino acids to link together to form a protein, while new corresponding amino acids are continually added to the tRNA.	51fb7759e5548a7d074696c8112b1a94	-1	-1
5	Okay, let me break it down for yuh. First thing, mRNA leave de nucleus and de first step inna protein synthesis is initiation. This where amino acids start join together from a START codon in de P site. Then, we got elongation and termination - this when amino acids continue to join up until a STOP codon is read on de mRNA in de A site. After dat, new corresponding amino acid get added to de tRNA. And last ting, tRNA weh carry de complementary anticodon recognize de complementary codon of de mRNA.	f439314ac18a3fa6cfa6303fe4ac4a3d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA, carrying the genetic code copied from DNA, leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels towards the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next steps involve tRNA adding new corresponding amino acids and bonding them with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, which forms a chain that eventually becomes the protein.	0b1a84b17f5e3a7e8a45225c0e003dad	-1	-1
5	The mRNA first leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it travels to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by a tRNA making a new corresponding amino acid, which is then carried to the mRNA, recognizing its complementary codon. The process initiates with a START codon at the P site and leads to the linking of amino acids together to create a protein.	eef15ff95c0a161c38862ed1c68fccbe	-1	-1
5	So look here, the whole shebang starts off with a START codon in the P site kickin' things into motion by linkin' together them amino acids to make a protein (that's called initiation). Then, we're off like a herd of turtles addin' a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. We keep this dance goin', linkin' amino acids together till we hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site (this part's known as elongation and termination). Then, just like cows at a salt lick, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get all bonded up to the amino acids on the adjacent tRNA. And that right there, is how protein synthesis works, clear as mud?	f7942f392ead431b4c6d0a8350dd9bee	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's the patter on protein synthesis. First off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore an' gallivants through the cytoplasm tae meet up with the ribosome or it birls intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, pure like a trio, which we call codons by rRNA. Finally, the matchin' amino acids at the other end of the tRNA get all cozy an' bond together wi' adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. It's all a bit of a dance really, but that's how proteins get assembled.	4233f475672a836d52d27314ab4b4196	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, holding genetic codes, exits the nucleus via the nuclear pore and travels through cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons, recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA, leading to a series of amino acids being linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and termination of the synthesis.	b7dd90a39c40ba403d90b419ad2fb2e5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. The process of initiation is marked by a START codon in the P site, which signals the addition of corresponding amino acids to tRNA. These amino acids are continually linked together, constituting elongation, until a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site is encountered, signifying termination and thus, marking the final step in protein synthesis.	bb3d2351955e4710d2aba63adc055b5f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and navigating to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, located within the cytoplasm. Next, the construction of protein initiates at the P site with a START codon, followed by an elongation process where amino acids are continually joined until the A site reads a STOP codon, signifying termination of the process.	0b3d3a27d0716b0806cb86f12a934556	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to a ribosome where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons. A tRNA molecule, carrying a specific anticodon that matches these mRNA codons, delivers the corresponding amino acid which bonds to the adjacent amino acids on another tRNA molecule; this sequence continues until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling the end of the protein chain construction.	ef38673d2c0b01463b6e5730bf101bbe	-1	-1
5	Awright, so here's the deal: First off, that mRNA's gotta take a hike outta the nucleus through what's called a nuclear pore. It's like it's rushin' for the T to get to Fenway on time, only it's headed for the cytoplasm and then the ribosome or maybe the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it gets there, it's all about addin' a fresh amino acid to the tRNA, kinda like addin' another Sox fan to the bleachers. This whole process keeps goin', with the amino acids comin' together like a line at Dunkin', until they hit this STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site - that's when you know it's game over and they've done their job.	3a8b6f364ae432321d313271a6111dbc	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, my china! So, first up the mRNA, light as a feather, breezes out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then hops onto a ride with the cytoplasm's currents, heading straight for either the ribosome or diving into the rough endoplasmic reticulum - depending on its mood I suppose. Then we have tRNA coming in strong like a lion, bringing along with it amino acids that bond to their mates on the neighbouring tRNA. Lastly, mRNA bases are read in threes, much like our local lotto numbers, in what boffins call codons - all thanks to our good friend rRNA.	1999b849991bc994cd610b022cd3e576	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA takes a hike from the nucleus, slipping through the nuclear pore like a Canuck's smooth hockey pass. Then, tRNA comes into play, carrying the complementary anticodon, it lines up with the mRNA like a Mountie on duty, recognizing its matching codon. This sets the stage for a new corresponding amino acid to join the party, attaching itself to the tRNA just as tight as a beaver to its dam. Lastly, this sequence of linking amino acids goes steady as a Canuck's resolve until a STOP sign in the form of codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, bringing the dance of elongation and termination to an end.	955ccd920cb6df4c6fd7a9b63d6eb586	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets called codons by rRNA. The tRNA, carrying the anticodon matching the mRNA's codon, brings along a corresponding amino acid, which is then added to the growing protein chain, as each subsequent tRNA recognizes its complementary codon on the mRNA and adds its amino acid to form peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids, building up the final protein molecule.	ca3360c2ec3ffedc7b75d5bd07b9fa8f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis stairts wi the mRNA leavin the nucleus. The first major step is initiation whaur amino acids are linked thegither tae make a protein, beginning wi a START codon in the P site. The neist step involves tRNA that's carryin the complementary anticodon recognisin the complementary codon o the mRNA. Thirdly, these amino acids continue tae be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site; this process is kent as elongation and termination. Lastly, it's important tae note that mRNA bases are read in triplets cried codons, an this is done by rRNA.	bf9f813fc1ed97cb40295c47a3d00803	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or travels to the ribosome within the cytoplasm. Once there, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the matching codon on the mRNA, leading to a corresponding amino acid being attached to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This process of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA within the A site, culminating in elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	af4238df475e8b2a4e0eec5ef50477aa	-1	-1
5	Upon leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA enters either the cytoplasm to reach ribosomes or travels to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA then initiates protein synthesis at the ribosome with the identification of a START codon in the P site, triggering the linkage of amino acids, a process which continues during elongation until a STOP codon is read in the A site, signaling termination and thus completing protein synthesis.	397322480db95325d99b5ced01b1a848	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, before it is read in triplets termed as codons by rRNA. This process continually adds corresponding amino acids to the tRNA until a 'STOP' codon is encountered on the mRNA within the A site, signalling the completion of both elongation and termination.	dff2c7b4f7608b9029080da98baa3cf5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA, as fast as greased lightning, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its way to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, in a process that's rare as hen's teeth, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by none other than rRNA, and finally, on the never-never, corresponding amino acids attached to the tRNA bond together to form a protein.	4f494e471195b37713a48c41dad57a19	-1	-1
5	Well bless your heart for askin'! So, ya got mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus, right? First off, it's gotta be read in groups of three, kinda like a recipe - we call these codons. Then, them amino acids get added to the tRNA which is like findin' a needle in a haystack but they manage it anyhow. Now comes the hard part, these amino acids gotta be linked together startin' with what we call a START codon in the P site - that's the initiation. Kinda like startin' to plow a field, ain't easy but gotta be done! Lastly and slower than molasses in January, this process keeps on keepin' on till a STOP codon pops up in the A site - that's when we know we're done linkin'. That there's protein synthesis for ya!	e903783dd3524f902a64d5c87621d57c	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it is read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. Then tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. The process of elongation and termination continues with amino acids being linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified in the A site.	3682f2f7b20bbfc6809e25d396ab4484	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start off when mRNA lef' de nucleus an read in triples, dem call it codons, by rRNA. Then tRNA weh carry di matchin' anticodon recognize di same codon pon di mRNA, a fresh amino acid add to di tRNA, and dem amino acids link up togetha for make a protein, starting with a START codon inna di P site. That be the initiation part.	692cb0b390e17968414381e237db2c95	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being read by tRNA, which recognizes its complementary codon on mRNA. Each tRNA brings a specific amino acid that it adds in sequence, forming a chain of amino acids until a stop codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the end of the process. This chain of amino acids then folds into a functional protein.	9987f9e2feadd57a23f7733cf8e8685d	-1	-1
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA moves to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum through the cytoplasm. It brings codons, triplets of bases read by rRNA, which guide the addition of corresponding amino acids to tRNA. This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination and concluding protein synthesis.	34e6d67ffe5df750eb5f0e9e2d44c269	-1	-1
5	"First off, that mRNA bolts from the nucleus like a deer spooked from cover, heading straight into the cytoplasm and onto the ribosome or maybe sneaks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, rRNA gets to work, reading those mRNA bases in groups of three, known around these parts as ""codons"". After that, we're adding new corresponding amino acids to tRNA faster than greased lightning. And for the grand finale, the corresponding amino acids found at the tail end of each tRNA are bonding together with their neighbor's amino acids. Sounds complex as a rubik's cube, don't it?"	fec0461521f419e49b21f4e3486754c2	-1	-1
5	Weel, first off, the mRNA saunters oot the nucleus by the nuclear pore, as casual as a coo in a field. Next up, tRNA, wi' its matchin' anticodon, spots the complementary codon o' the mRNA - it's like they're twa pals meeting in a crowd! The mRNA bases are read in wee groups o' three called codons by rRNA, kinda like readin' a book wi' only three letters per word. And finally, a shiny new amino acid gets hitched ontae the tRNA - just like addin' another charm to your bracelet!	105085f49c73f548857a0f1e2844e1b7	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis continues with tRNA recognising and binding to the complementary codon on the mRNA. This event triggers the start of the initiation phase where amino acids begin to link together at the START codon located in the P site. The process keeps unfolding, as more amino acids are added during the elongation phase until a STOP codon is reached on the mRNA within the A site, signifying the termination phase and effectively completing protein synthesis.	cbe413c537326432b235504a6451b994	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and pairs with a new tRNA molecule, which has the corresponding amino acid. The process continues as these amino acids on each tRNA bond together, forming a chain that grows until a STOP codon is read from the mRNA, signifying the end of protein synthesis.	b19a6f98f010a7f26c059076e7caecab	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, we move to cytoplasm where it binds to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, during the initiation phase, amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon at the P site, forming a protein. Finally, the corresponding amino acids attached to adjacent tRNA molecules are bonded together, effectively building the protein sequence.	ca96cf0eabf3206df3a3b2e5187a0c23	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, the mRNA bases are read in triplets (codons) by rRNA. Then, tRNA carrying an anticodon complementary to the codon on the mRNA recognises and binds to this codon. The corresponding amino acids bound to the tRNA then link together in a chain, starting from a 'START' codon in a specific site known as the P site. This process repeats, with each new tRNA adding its amino acid to the growing chain until a complete protein is formed.	9ae96a5fba3fa18c88d184e2d14856fd	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first you got that mRNA scootin' outta the nucleus and hittin' the cytoplasm, headin' for the ribosome or maybe takin' a trip into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, those rRNA are readin' mRNA bases in triplets, we call these codons. As this is goin’ on, there's tRNA, each sportin' an amino acid, and they're matchin' up with the codons. These matched up amino acids get all chummy, bondin' with their neighbors. This jolly little party keeps rollin' until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in what we call the A site. That's when everyone knows it's time to pack it in and call it a day; basically the elongation and termination of protein synthesis. Not bad, right?	4c4cd00a953040aab34adf6da33fb1f9	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA high-tails it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, just like a buck bolting from a cheetah, the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon (swopping U for A and sticking with C+G) recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. Then it's back to the grindstone as a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. Finally, these amino acids are strung together to make a protein starting with a START codon in the P site - it's like they're building Table Mountain one stone at a time. And you know what they say, Rome wasn't built in a day, but that doesn't mean it isn't strong as an ox!	39ec2fb98a6579c85155e3f42b50d052	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it heads into the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum and attaches to a ribosome. Here's where things get as twisted as Toronto's streets: rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons. Then, corresponding amino acids are added to each tRNA molecule, a process as tight as a beaver's dam. This creation of an amino acid chain keeps going until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, making this complicated synthesis come to a halt as heavy as a moose.	59d4683ecbe23a312444769bcaff7227	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA, enabling specific amino acids to bond onto it, which sequentially connects with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, facilitating the creation of a new protein.	2c2d239dd6b667131c1c2a4c790aa630	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA bases are read in sets o' three, or 'codons', by somethin' cried rRNA. Then this wee critter we cry a tRNA, carryin' the matchin' 'anticodon', clocks the complementary codon of the mRNA, ye ken? Wi' a new correspondin' amino acid added tae the tRNA, these amino acids start tae link up tae make a protein, all startin' frae a START codon in whit we call the P site. So there ye hae it - that's protein synthesis for ye!	cfe01e6c99fdad5d21ad3735044dfec8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Next, tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon identifies the compatible codon on the mRNA, followed by the linking together of amino acids starting from a START codon in the P site, this process continues until a STOP codon is read at the A site on the mRNA, marking the end of protein formation.	e7dadd67e11badcd748a8cadb6a6eddb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels either to the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon pairs with the corresponding codon on mRNA, allowing for the sequential bonding of adjacent amino acids on tRNA - a magnificent dance of cellular biochemistry which ultimately crafts proteins.	6dccb567e2b61893d8535f8200138c4c	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins when the messenger RNA (mRNA) leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA, which has its bases read in triplets known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), enables initiation by aligning with a START codon in the P site, marking the beginning of where amino acids are linked together to form a protein. Each tRNA carries its corresponding amino acid, and these are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, crafting the growing protein chain. Isn't it fascinating how these intricate steps allow for the creation of proteins vital for our bodies' function?	62a3994a7ebf07d0289bd471d62017ed	-1	-1
5	Sure, it's no bother to explain this process. The first step is like a hare out of a trap - mRNA exits the nucleus sharpish via a nuclear pore. Then we have initiation, where amino acids are paired together starting at a START codon in the P site, like putting a puzzle together. Next up is elongation and termination, with the amino acids continuing to be linked until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, like a traffic light turning red. Lastly, just like mates linking arms at the pub, the corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond with their neighbours on the adjacent tRNA. That’s how you get your protein synthesis done and dusted!	380e03e7eddd5cf6decaa03593bfc636	-1	-1
5	"Well, here's what's happenin', quicker than a jackrabbit on a date. That mRNA fella takes the backdoor out of the nucleus straight to them ribosomes. Then along comes that tRNA carrying its matching anticodon and says ""Howdy"" to the mRNA's codon. Those amino acids get together for a shindig at the P site, kicking off with a START codon. And just like adding biscuits to a batch, each new amino acid gets hitched to the growing chain by tRNA. It's all part of life's two-step, my friend!"	88df4499d96c4d3bca4eddbeb83a49c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying to the ribosome situated in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	When mRNA exits the nucleus, it sails through the cytoplasm till it hits a ribosome or gets inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, the tRNA with matching anticodon to the mRNA codon gets noticed. As the amino acids connected to other ends of nearby tRNA get bonded, a fresh and matching amino acid is added atop the tRNA. That's how proteins come about!	90ddf9708dcfac2a13c89b09eea4a051	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Nae wind, nae wave, it sets aff wi' a START codon in the P site, kickin' aff protein synthesis by linkin' thegither amino acids (initiation). This wee dance goes on until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, gie'in the signal tae stop addin' amino acids (elongation and termination). Lastly, the amino acids on the ither side of the tRNA are bonded to their neighbours on the adjacent tRNA, mony a mickle maks a muckle!	ccb25990690a2b6d2fd4a4218e863737	-1	-1

5	Awright, heah's the skinny. First things first, you got mRNA bookin' it from the nucleus to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then the tRNA, carryin' the anticodon that's a perfect match for the mRNA codon, comes into play. This is where we kick things off with a START codon in what we call the P site, kinda like the Sox at Fenway. Finally, we keep addin' new amino acids to the tRNA, building up our protein just like we build up our city. Simple as that!	5ae18f8bb32df732b8271adcca32249e	-1	-1
5	For sure! Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis is a four-step process in which we begin strong as a lion. Firstly, tRNA with the complementary anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA, as neat as a pin. Secondly, a new corresponding amino acid is added to this tRNA, quick-quick. Thirdly, these amino acids are linked together to create a protein - this starts at the codon in the P site, it's like starting the Comrades Marathon.

5	Starting with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons, initiating protein synthesis when it encounters a START codon in the P site. This leads to an ongoing process of linking amino acids until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and initiating termination. Consequently, a protein is formed through this intricate dance of initiation, elongation and termination.	c9e8d4030a9a714d71c957cad445b46f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying into the cytoplasm. It's then read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. In a thrilling procession, corresponding amino acids on tRNA are bonded together, forming a chain that continues to lengthen until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA - signalling the end of this biochemical masterpiece!	4b311370ae73ac3049e6e88fc500687c	-1	-1
5	With the speed of greased lightning, mRNA marches out of the nucleus, its codons read like a book by rRNA.

5	Well, the protein synthesis dance starts when mRNA rambles outta the nucleus and either waltzes through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or does a do-si-do into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's got a tune to it, in groups of three notes called codons, which are read by rRNA like sheet music. This dandy little tune kicks off with somethin' called a START codon that's set up in the P site - that's our initiation step, y'all! From there, those amino acid fellas keep on linkin' together like two peas in a pod until a STOP codon makes an appearance in the A site; that's your elongation and termination steps. And voila, just like that, we got ourselves a protein!	9a24e7bb65eb34e10446c094df186a9e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, containing the genetic instructions, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.

5	Well, 'ere ya go. The mRNA skedaddles out the nucleus and moseys over to the ribosome or heads into that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now them mRNA bases are read in chunks of three, y'know, codons, by the rRNA. Then a fancy new amino acid gets hitched up to the tRNA. Once that's sorted out, the tRNA, holding onto its anticodon, buddies up with the mRNA's complementary codon. It's like they're speaking their own special language, U pairs with A and C is pals with G!	40cd3aad17524cb5ebf1c5014984a8a2	-1	-1
5	"Firstly, mRNA saunters out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm or makes a beeline for the rough endoplasmic reticulum; it's nae on a Sunday stroll. A tRNA sporting the complementary anticodon gives a nod to the matching codon on the mRNA - a bit like finding your dance partner at a ceilidh. The protein creation kicks off with a START codon taking up residence in the P site (that's the initiation step, mind). Then, as sure as ""mony a mickle maks a muckle"", each new amino acid is hitched onto its corresponding tRNA, building up our protein just like adding bricks to a wall."	728e736d47feb9a9b2a18692fb06d01f	-1	-1

Lastly, them amino acids on the tRNA end get bonded to the next tRNA’s amino acids, faster than a car on the Pike.	bd6384233a777aab0dd33d35d27d8fa7	-1	-1
5	When the mRNA bolts out of the nucleus like a veld fire, it takes a quick-quick trip through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As strong as a lion, each tRNA gets its corresponding amino acid added, and these amino acids bond with their neighbours on adjacent tRNAs - that's how we assemble our proteins, boet!	a234dd6342e5b9bb0e9e6e752e4f6867	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm arriving at the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with the initiation where an amino acid is added to tRNA and a Start codon in the P site prompts the linking of amino acids to create a protein. The elongation and termination stages occur as amino acids keep joining until a Stop codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, ending the synthesis process.	c091f44a56475301fe158dcef9f769ba	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA carrying an anticodon that's complementary to an mRNA codon recognises and binds to it, initiating the process of protein formation at a START codon in the P site.

Then just like hen's teeth, these corresponding amino acids on tRNA get bonded to their neighbours. These mRNA bases are read in groups of three, or codons, by rRNA - bang on reading, so to speak. Lastly, akin to starting a race, a START codon in the P site cues the linking of amino acids to kickstart crafting a protein.	c74dbfb20320689702c38ac47eb5be38	-1	-1
5	Well bless your heart for askin'. It's a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, but here's how it works. First off, mRNA, fresh outta the nucleus, gets read in these little groups of three called codons by somethin' known as rRNA. Next up, tRNA - carrying what we call an anticodon that matches up with the mRNA codon (like U=A and C+G) - recognizes the mRNA. Then we get to addin' a brand new amino acid to the tRNA, which is just about as exciting as a frog in a glass of milk. This whole process keeps on truckin' until we get to a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call the A site - and that right there is when elongation and termination occur. So all in all, it's a bit like barkin' up a tree - it takes some patience, but eventually you'll find what you're lookin' for.	2bd6e39541642cc1bac570a589539e57	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's departure from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves several key steps. The process begins with the recognition of mRNA's codon by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, followed by the initiation phase, where a protein is created beginning with a START codon in the P site. Amino acids are then continuously linked during the elongation phase until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signals termination.	147f0a97fccec46823bf03278bfa62ec	-1	-1
5	From the nucleus, mRNA makes its getaway through a nuclear pore. After this, the mRNA's codon gets recognized by the tRNA carrying the matching anticodon (U=A, C+G). Then, amino acids weh deh on the tRNA's odda end bond with the amino acids from the next tRNA. Finally, linking up these amino acids starts with a START codon inna di P site to create protein (initiation).	8bb07fd78c1752567cacf5dd48de0e5e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having left the nucleus, ventures into the cytoplasm and attaches itself to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	1. mRNA's journey begins when it exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, heading towards the cytoplasm.  2. Once in the cytoplasm, mRNA may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum or go directly to the ribosome where protein synthesis continues.  3. The ribosome reads each triplet of bases or codon on mRNA via rRNA, ensuring accurate translation of genetic information. 4. The process of elongation and termination involves continuous linking of amino acids until a STOP codon appears in the A site on mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	daae4f54bf77ad4db4caac7bf8eb9201	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's start it off when that mRNA makes its way outta the nucleus. First step is that tRNA with the matching anticodon, you know like a jigsaw puzzle piece, finds its partner codon on that mRNA. Once they're together like a couple at a barn dance, the tRNA adds on a new amino acid. This keeps happenin', one after the other, faster than a jackrabbit on a date till they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA. And just like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig, it ain't easy, but those amino acids from each tRNA get bonded together tighter than bark on a tree.	321625105e24c76698ce7569fe78afc0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' mRNA getting oot the nucleus, each of its codons being read in threefold by rRNA. tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognises the matching codon on the mRNA, addin' new amino acids as they go along, a process akin tae sayin' mony a mickle maks a muckle! This forms the beginnings of our protein, as round as a pease, starting wi' a START codon in the P site. It's like nature's own wee factory, cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey, but it gets the job done.	e72b791d2581f570e5ece49bbdd153b4	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the mRNA's departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it's noteworthy that the mRNA's bases are interpreted in units of three, known as codons, by rRNA within the ribosome.

5	Protein synthesis initiates with a START codon on the mRNA being recognised by the tRNA carrying its complementary anticodon and an associated amino acid. This is followed by a process wherein additional tRNAs recognise subsequent codons on the mRNA, each carrying the corresponding amino acid, which are then successively bonded together to form a protein chain.	53ec2223de07e574d8d6a8265babd137	-1	-1
5	Alright, first things first, mRNA peacin' outta the nucleus, right? Then we're lookin' at these triplets, codons, gettin' read up by rRNA. Now, you gotta picture each tRNA bringin' in a new amino acid like a Fenway frank vendor on game day. These acids link up stronger than a Southie dockworker until some genius reads the stop sign - that’s your STOP codon on the mRNA. Boom, there's yer protein synthesis for ya.	9a87f9d8088b57b3b1f024017527c5af	-1	-1
5	Like a leopard leaving its lair, mRNA makes its exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It is then read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA just as light as a feather, whilst new amino acids are continually added to the tRNA, strong as a lion. The process kicks off with a START codon in the P site, resulting in an initiation of amino acids linked together to form a protein.	ab32a3b310ca12e9ef5f1c7541b8464c	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's migration from the nucleus, protein synthesis begins with the reading of mRNA bases in groupings of three, known as codons, by rRNA. This is followed by the initiation phase where a START codon is recognised in the P site, marking the beginning of protein creation. During this process, the corresponding amino acids at the opposite end of tRNA are linked together with neighbouring tRNA's amino acids. The elongation and termination stage continues to forge these links until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is identified, signalling the completion of protein synthesis.	4bad022ec97438dd9d120601d81752d6	-1	-1
5	Initiating protein synthesis, mRNA departs the nucleus and proceeds to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, mRNA's bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, which is then identified by tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon. Elongation and termination of the process occur when a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected, prompting linked amino acids to cease connection.	124f5e96871f82780e27aec2b17b7fd9	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA leaves the nucleus an' heads intae the cytoplasm whaur the ribosome reads the bases in triplets kent as codons. This is whaur the initiation stage kicks aff, wi' a START codon in the P site guidin' the sequence o' amino acids tae be linked th'gither tae mak' a protein. Next, tRNA carryin' the complementary anticodon recognises its mate, the mRNA codon. Lastly, the matchin' amino acids aff each end o' different tRNAs get bonded th'gither. It's a sair ficht, but at the end o't, we've got wirselves a brand new protein!	b2dc8acd9287c0c9d7672389a968bdd4	-1	-1
5	After migrating from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA reaches the ribosome via the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Sure, to kick off with the speed of a greyhound, mRNA races from the nucleus carrying the genetic code. Then, reading it like an old book in three-letter chunks - these are our codons you see - is the job of rRNA. Now, it's as busy as a one-legged man in a kicking contest, linking up amino acids following the instructions from mRNA. This dance goes on and on till, wet as an otter's pocket, the STOP codon shows up and puts an end to this chain - and there you go, you have your protein!	5e6ba5ad9b2d4b7a855e17d7b49a87d2	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart for askin' such a question! Alright now, follow me here. First off, mRNA gets read in clusters of three called codons by this lil' thing called rRNA, just like peas in a pod.

5	First aff, mRNA leaves the nucleus an' heids tae the ribosome. Next, a tRNA wi' th' richt anticodon matches up wi' the codon on the mRNA. This means a new amino acid gets hitched tae the tRNA. The amino acids oan adjacent tRNAs are bonded thegither, an' this gaes on until a STOP codon appears oan the mRNA.	62e75365035ea07939d7d2b5357b050b	-1	-1
5	mRNA, after exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, travels either to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum. Once there, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in triplets known as codons, initiating the protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site and sequentially linking together amino acids to form a protein.	07aac2dc2c333409b010d8d85bd2cf1e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm, where it attaches to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues as mRNA bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA while tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes these codons on the mRNA. Subsequently, the corresponding amino acids attached to the other end of the tRNA bond with the amino acids of adjacent tRNAs, forming a protein chain.	c62a2066ce70b5b656d3b18daea1d9bf	-1	-1
5	Initiating with mRNA's departure from the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum, it approaches a ribosome where its bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. The protein synthesis commences at a START codon located in the P site, where corresponding amino acids are linked and a new one is added to the tRNA.	b4d6845a44405b0e7d21e87e7dffe1f8	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA wave has left the nucleus, it's as wet as an otter's pocket in cytoplasm, making its way to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. At the puck of a game, new amino acids are added onto their respective tRNA, and this carries on solid as the Rock of Cashel until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signalling the end of this bonding game between adjacent amino acids from different tRNAs.	dd5797eccf849d7c899fdff795fd6088	-1	-1
5	Well, lord have mercy, this ain't exactly a walk in the park, but here goes. When that mRNA shoots out of the nucleus like a hound dog after a rabbit, the first thing happens is one of them tRNAs with a matching anticodon spots it and sidles up real friendly-like. Then, wouldn't ya know, a brand spanking new amino acid gets loaded onto that same tRNA. Now we're cookin' with gas! That amino acid starts getting all chummy with the next one over on the adjacent tRNA. Last thing that happens is this whole shebang keeps on truckin' 'til a STOP code on the mRNA tells 'em to put the brakes on. And there ya have it - proteins!	11df2dd10e49b162f64ea48d993072af	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the journey of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Once there, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Next, tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon identifies its corresponding mRNA codon. The process continues with amino acids linking up until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, signaling the end of this complex process.	40e60b6397ab6e94ab54fdddf3a56d24	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read in three-part sections called codons by rRNA. These codons call over tRNA carrying corresponding amino acids, which bond with each other continuously until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, indicating the end of the process. Now you have a new protein!	04cf972576f92e4c98a06fd2f052418d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, sparking the initiation phase where amino acids start linking together from a START codon in the P site. As the protein chain is forming, the corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, creating a complete protein structure.	cdbaac0a983946fc86fc14ff583bb16c	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm to reach a ribosome or to enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of protein synthesis begins at a START codon in the P site, creating a link between amino acids to form a protein (initiation). Concurrently, corresponding amino acids at the end of the tRNA bond together with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. In addition, new matching amino acids are constantly added to the tRNA.	9567d2d77025b703e370b1258f2f3969	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus through that nuclear pore, it hightails it through that cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, in the P site, them amino acids start gettin' linked together like a freight train into a protein, starting with a START codon - it's initiation, see? As this whole shebang goes on, each tRNA gets loaded up with a new amino acid, kinda like reloadin' your shotgun after each shot.	1cb48705c11fc82bf60beed34bc9ecb1	-1	-1
5	Nae bother, here's how it goes: That mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, right? Then we've got these amino acids hitched to the tRNA, getting friendly and bonding with their neighbours. The whole party kicks off with a START codon in the P site, linking aa's into a protein. They keep going full pelt till they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site, putting an end to the gallivanting.	441abed2f81d661e022d1ca4d9357ad6	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it voyages through the cytoplasm and makes its way to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here begins the exciting process of protein synthesis: initiation commences with a START codon in the P site, which triggers the assembly of amino acids into a protein chain, and with each new tRNA that arrives, another corresponding amino acid is joyously added to this growing chain!	4093b9f712a0121f4ac4ab48b4582787	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus via the nuclear pore and being recognized by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon.

5	Protein synthesis is a marvel of cellular mechanics that starts when mRNA escapes the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, in a process orchestrated by rRNA, this mRNA's bases are read in triplets, or codons, each of which directs the addition of a corresponding amino acid to a lengthening chain on a tRNA molecule, and this continues until a stop codon signals for termination to wrap up this brilliant process.	d32d671148a6a53f6a9b7070a01e2807	-1	-1
5	So here's the scoop: First off, mRNA bolts outta the nucleus and gets read in trips (or codons) by this thing called rRNA. Then we got initiation where a START codon kicks things off in the P site, right? Next up, a new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA. Lastly, these amino acids on the tail end of the tRNA get all buddy-buddy with the neighboring tRNA’s amino acids. Boom, you got yourself a protein!	a98d2dc11e9daa5378f7f1c5749f6521	-1	-1
5	Right, so first off, our mRNA buddy makes a quick-quick exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, ja? Next thing you know, new amino acids are being added to the tRNA like a veld fire. It's not over yet, these corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA start bonding with the neighbour tRNA’s amino acids. Just like a leopard doesn't change its spots, these amino acids don't stop linking until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, and that's when we reach the finish line - the elongation and termination stage.	b1c72d1e39dfb450f5b16308800b9704	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's just the beginning of a journey as unpredictable as Maritime weather! The tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the reversed codon of mRNA with a precision that would have you thinking it's hot as Toronto in July. Just like adding another layer during a cold Yukon winter, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. Finally, as though they're building an igloo piece by piece, the corresponding amino acids on opposite ends of the tRNA bond to each other's amino acids, ultimately creating a protein.	ec05c74c80d4d2e0098f22564c606954	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys into the cytoplasm to find the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon arrival, it initiates a fascinating process where each tRNA's corresponding amino acids are covalently joined to adjacent ones; this sequence continues dynamically until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, marking the culmination of elongation and termination.	9a1794c9830d1f8f18313570461c9afc	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gies a wee trip fae the nucleus intae the cytoplasm richt tae the ribosome or it micht just tak a venture intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Noo, we've got this canny tRNA wi the complementary anticodon that's spot on for recognising the mRNA's codon. Then things get a bitty exciting! This is when we kick aff wi a START codon in the P site an' we start linkin' thegither these amino acids to mak up our protein. We keep this patter goin' till we hit upon a STOP codon oan the mRNA in the A site, an’ that’s us done – protein synthesized!	515d0714119aa72fada277c043bad2f1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis springs into action when mRNA leaves the nucleus, navigating its way to a ribosome or taking a detour through the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. It's here that the magic happens, with rRNA reading mRNA bases in triplets known as codons; this information is used to add corresponding amino acids onto the tRNA - like adding beads onto a string. This bead-adding carries on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis and creating a chain of linked amino acids ready for use!	a72dcb6eab24c303e9ee0d548105566a	-1	-1
5	Starting with the journey of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm, protein synthesis initiates. Subsequently, tRNA bearing complementary anticodons identifies matching codons on the mRNA, leading to the bonding of corresponding amino acids at the other end of each tRNA. This process of elongation carries on until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site which signals termination and thus, completes protein synthesis.	07fc8690caa7baaf1b7e8e6de657a41a	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exiting of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it embarks on a thrilling journey through the cytoplasm, heading for either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, its bases are read in triplets by rRNA - these are known as codons! This leads to an exciting chain reaction of amino acids being linked together during the elongation phase. This fascinating process continues until a 'STOP' codon is read on the mRNA, signalling termination and thus completing protein synthesis!	7a5e7af70446d33900245ee8aa5378a8	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's get the ball rolling with protein synthesis. First off, our mRNA is out the gap and leaves the nucleus faster than greased lightning through a nuclear pore. Then we have the tRNA, bang on target it recognizes its partner codon in the mRNA. As fast as you can say 'peas and carrots', amino acids are linked together until they meet a STOP sign or a STOP codon on the mRNA. Finally, it's no time to do things arseways, so tRNA's amino acids bond with their next-door neighbours seamlessly, creating our protein.	69320ac43c3dfefbc02c637f54ca5972	-1	-1
5	Well, after that mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus, four things happen. First off, tRNA hauls along the complementary anticodon to match up with mRNA's codon. Then, the amino acids riding shotgun on the tRNA bond with the amino acids on its neighbor. After that, a fresh amino acid gets added to the tRNA crew. Finally, those amino acids start lining up like dominoes to form a protein, kickin' off with a START codon at what they call the P site. And that's how you stir up a protein!	924b7c100d678989264e05946eff9d63	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the migration of mRNA out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by the initiation phase where protein assembly commences at a START codon in the P site and continues with the elongation phase, where amino acids are successively joined until a STOP codon is encountered. During this process, tRNA's corresponding amino acids are bonded together, effectively building the protein.	ee45bdd8219b4a26f45e2124a1c15f2e	-1	-1
5	After mRNA lef nucleus, it tek a journey through cytoplasm goin to ribosome or it might enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, the mRNA bases get read inna triplets we call codons by rRNA. Then, new corresponding amino acid get added to tRNA and the related amino acids pon the other end of tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	dc93c6e406fc577f7f709c474e3974ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA. tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the codon of mRNA, then a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA which are eventually bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	7ebc3b6eecb9c4586cbf44845342c5f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA. Then tRNA carrying the anticodon identifies the matching codon on mRNA, which leads to the bonding of adjacent amino acids carried by tRNA. This linking of amino acids continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognized, marking the end of protein synthesis.	e48fd9a54e56023ae67b64997ad73529	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing! First off, that mRNA up and leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore quicker than a jackrabbit on a date. Now, here's where things get interesting - we got this START codon settlin' in at the P site, kickin' off the whole process by startin' to link amino acids together to form a protein. This carryin’ on keeps happening until a STOP codon shows up in the A site sayin’, ""Alright, that's enough."" That's our signal to stop addin' new amino acids to the tRNA. So, end of the day, you're left with a perfectly crafted protein. Can't do much without those fellas, I tell ya!"	ac164a27754d4a9832015e566788a158	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA exits the nucleus like a bat out of hell, heading for either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Once there, protein synthesis kicks off with a START codon in the P site-- that's when amino acids start to link together like a chain (we call this initiation). Then new amino acids are added to the tRNA, faster than a midgie's blink. And finally, these corresponding amino acids on each end of the tRNA bond together with nearby tRNA's amino acids, creating a strong bond like two pals at a Celtic game. There you have it, protein synthesis in four major steps!	ff549a4af78c7b3cedcf4359a0b2e8c1	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the travelling of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Secondly, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three known as codons by rRNA. This is followed by the bonding of corresponding amino acids on one end of tRNA to those on adjacent tRNA. The final stage is the continual linking of these amino acids, which stops once a STOP codon is read on mRNA located in the A site, signifying the completion of elongation and termination.	57f4d9de370b621567e978a23be00df8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The process proceeds as mRNA's codons are recognized by complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules, which bring corresponding amino acids to elongate the protein chain until a stop signal is registered, terminating synthesis.	355c6bd36dc1b30fd318d5df9690e001	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the protein synthesis process starts with initiation where tRNA carrying anticodons recognizes complementary codons on mRNA, beginning with the START codon in the P site. Amino acids then get linked in a sequence to form a protein in an ongoing phase called elongation and this process concludes when a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, signaling termination.	afd5f2e07a4344cb6946abbadb9826da	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and proceeds to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm, where the tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, identifies its corresponding mRNA codon. This matching of anticodons and codons allows for the linkage of amino acids carried by adjacent tRNAs, commencing with a START codon at the P site, thus forming a protein chain during the initiation phase.	cac92d579fca759e54da266be3a12cba	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, no bigger than a clam's hindquarters. Then it makes its way over to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, movin' faster than a car on the Pike. Inside the ribosome, rRNA reads those mRNA bases in groups of three, we call 'em codons- a little like how we Bostonians read the Sox lineup. Lastly, new amino acid gets tacked onto the tRNA, climbin' higher than the Hancock tower.	6ccdfdf9ef3eef3e1540915cce77619b	-1	-1
5	Opening the gate for mRNA to exit the nucleus, it then gets read by rRNA through codon triplets. This jigsaw puzzle motion kick-starts with a START codon in the P site, triggering tRNA to recognise and match complementary anticodons to mRNA's codons, resulting in amino acids chaining up like a lion forming a roar, building the protein.	08bf879fdbb9c8d5d8966d3e57f2ed6c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, then in the P site, a START codon initiates the process by linking amino acids to form a protein. Following that, new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA which recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA (U=A, C+G). This sequence continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and initiation of termination.	f74c90eca6f9d768168d9504fd240aed	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, which carries genetic codes from the nucleus, exiting via a nuclear pore and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA matches corresponding amino acids, initiating bonding with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, a process that continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted, marking the elongation and termination stages.	b1aad75cefcc717cc724838afd021ba8	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA heads oot frae the nucleus and travels through the cell's cytoplasm tae reach the ribosome or ventures intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, mRNA bases are read in sets ay three, kent as codons, by rRNA. Next, correspondin' amino acids located at the opposite end ay the tRNA are bonded wi' nearby tRNA’s amino acids. Finally, this process ay linkin' amino acids gaes on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA i' the A site, markin' the end ay elongation and initiation ay termination.	4a4c48e318b2e621e1ae0037465abdf4	-1	-1
5	Post departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA is decoded in codons by rRNA within the ribosome where each codon corresponds to specific amino acids that are attached to tRNA. This process initiates with a START codon in the P site and progresses as these amino acids are sequentially linked together, ultimately resulting in the synthesis of a protein.	ec8430a95db4f546f7c371f334a194d3	-1	-1
5	"The protein synthesis process begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and associating with the ribosome, where tRNA carrying anticodons complementary to mRNA codons recognizes and binds to them. Then, the specific amino acids attached at the other end of each tRNA get linked together into a growing polypeptide chain, which continues until a ""STOP"" codon on the mRNA signals the termination of elongation and thus, the completion of protein synthesis."	2039f36e367ef2ed3aae68f3369e805e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, which is then read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The corresponding anticodons on tRNA recognise these codons and bring along new corresponding amino acids, which are bonded to neighbouring tRNAs, facilitating a continual growth of the protein chain.	4f3525ebd05d35411980e0b7bfd47cde	-1	-1
5	"Sure as eggs, the protein synthesis process is a complex dance that's been going on for donkey's years. First off, our mRNA leaves the nucleus and its bases are read in threesome chunks known as codons by rRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel. Next up, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes this codon group on the mRNA like long-lost friends. Then, before you can say ""Jack Robinson"", a fresh amino acid is added to the tRNA. Last but not least, on the never never, these new amino acids bond with their neighbours on adjacent tRNA molecules, forming one grand protein chain."	61cbf6ba65919d8f15e9876cda827436	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it's a bit like this. First off, that mRNA's gotta make a break from the nucleus and hitch a ride on over to the ribosome or maybe into that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got some kind of meet-up, y'know? The tRNA with its matching (U=A, C+G) anticodon spots the corresponding codon on the mRNA and they link up. Next up, it's like a chain gang—those amino acids from different tRNA are bonding together, starting from the START codon in what they call the P site. So we get ourselves a nice new protein all strung together. It ain't nothing but a molecular hoedown!	19c22f0a5a263e74e50fd5628f6e79d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, traverses the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then continues with the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA, and finally, amino acids are connected together starting from a START codon in the P site to form a protein.	403f8a311e29cd5f9317e709e99ec737	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA step out the nucleus and it read in triplet code we call codons, that part manage by rRNA. Next, the amino acids on the tRNA line up and bond with each other. After that, they keep joining until a STOP codon show up on the mRNA at the A site - that's the elongation and termination parts. Finally, from a START codon at the P site, the amino acids start to link to form a protein - we call that initiation.	1b6191815db9da2ce7ee5d56cc354004	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, initiating from its departure from the nucleus, includes traversing through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Its bases are then interpreted by rRNA in triplets known as codons, leading to the addition of a new matching amino acid to the tRNA. The final key step is the bonding of these corresponding amino acids on tRNA's other end to the neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, culminating in protein synthesis.	e466ea0f1702b1c56b5a917ad2865b8e	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA departs from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then journeys through cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	"Sure thing. So, after mRNA scoots out the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it rustles up the process by bonding one of them tRNA molecules loaded with a new amino acid. Like a well-oiled assembly line, more amino acids keep getting strung along until that mRNA hollers ""STOP"" with its codon in the A site. Then you got yourself a brand new protein, right as rain."	10c3befd2219b4797ab1037c3a2b40ce	-1	-1
5	Guid by mRNA, it wends its way oot the nucleus and into the cytoplasm to find a ribosome or sneaks intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, guided by codons - wee triplet codes scrieved on the mRNA by rRNA - amino acids get hitched up tae the tRNA. This dance continues, linking amino acids together until they hit upon a STOP codon in the A site, marking the end of the line for elongation and kicking off termination. Thus, through mony a mickle maks a muckle, these wee steps team up to build proteins.	db7298095df2f69bd1b58d275642562a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then a tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA. This recognition leads to the bonding of corresponding amino acids at the other end of the tRNA to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, continuing until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, thus marking elongation and termination.	4f6336790a1c6ee01f302849cb1d8c40	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where mRNA leaves the nucleus and a START codon is recognized on the P site, signaling for the linkage of amino acids to start creating a protein. As more corresponding amino acids are added to their respective tRNA, they bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids in the elongation phase, expanding the protein sequence until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site during termination, signifying that the protein synthesis process is complete.	82861b139f94dd3694de9818e8c2f34c	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis commences with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then proceeding towards the ribosome where its bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Following this, the protein creation initiates at a START codon in the P site and continues to connect amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, signaling termination and hence concluding the protein synthesis process.	237b303104c04fa1d4703330edd2bf32	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, starting with its departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiates a sequence of well-orchestrated procedures. The mRNA's bases are interpreted in triplets or codons by rRNA, a process that commences at a START codon located in the P site, where amino acids are then successively linked to form a protein, with each new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA.	7754aee13b6ebde16c19aee3adb4d917	-1	-1
5	Ferst, ya got yer mRNA sneakin' outta the nucleus and each triplet base, we call 'em codons, is read by the rRNA. Then, these tRNA fellas carryin’ the anticodon that matches up real nice with the mRNA's codon come along. The tRNA is like a Southie dockworker, haulin' a new amino acid to be added each time. Once they're all lined up, it's like buildin' the Hancock Tower - those corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNAs are bonded together, creatin' a protein denser than some good clam chowder.	9cec1fb05a86396c9ad9862d2e9887dd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, nè, it's a process as layered as a Biltong and it starts with mRNA making its journey out of the nucleus. Thereafter, the initiation phase kicks off when amino acids link together at the START codon in the P site, like builders laying that first brick. Then, like a cross-country Runner that keeps going till they see the finish line, these amino acids continue to link until they reach a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. Now check here, during this walkabout, you've got your tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizing the matching codon of the mRNA - kind of like finding your mate at a Sokkie. Lastly, each amino acid carried by the tRNA bonds with its adjacent mate - strong as a lion holding its prey.	18fee919edfe1fb6fbcc4ce0113c7ffa	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to either link up with a ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA, equipped with a complementary anticodon, identifies its corresponding mRNA codon, initiating protein synthesis through a START codon in the P site; this leads to the accumulation of corresponding amino acids on the tRNA, constructing a protein in the process.	ffce5e6d8db6e5336ec4114b04aeb533	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Herein commences protein synthesis as amino acids link together starting from a START codon in the P site - a process known as initiation. A new corresponding amino acid is subsequently introduced to the tRNA, while rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons.	f80e21f906f4aab79fb45bf85eb04d25	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then, a tRNA wi' th' matchin' anticodon recognises th' complementary codon o' th' mRNA. A new correspondin' amino acid is then hitched tae the tRNA. This process keeps gaun, linkin' amino acids, until a STOP codon on the mRNA in th' A site is read, bringin' it aw tae an end.	7ba83983aa1dd7bf84f348e93959caa5	-1	-1
5	Initiating with mRNA's journey from nucleus through the nuclear pore, it finds its place onto the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) where its bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons. Following this, each codon instructs the addition of a specific amino acid to transfer RNA (tRNA), and these amino acids then join together, commencing with a START codon in the P site, to give shape to a new protein - a process marked as initiation.	3767ece76cf457fffc49ea3ebc5a03ee	-1	-1
5	Upon its triumphant departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA, carrying within it a profound code revealed in triplets known as codons, embarks on an intricate journey. It encounters tRNA which, bearing complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G), recognizes its mRNA counterpart; this interaction induces the addition of a corresponding new amino acid to the tRNA, setting the stage for the exquisite ballet of protein synthesis.	e3c2ed020564111b538624ba4ef734da	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm, protein synthesis unfolds across multiple key stages. The mRNA bases are deciphered in triplets known as codons by rRNA, followed by tRNA bonding its respective amino acids to those of adjoining tRNAs. This process of pairing and bonding continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signalling a halt to elongation and ultimately terminating protein synthesis.	c32bca5411af3527a39097e0a79e722d	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA bidding adieu to the nucleus, it's as fast as greased lightning meeting up with tRNA carrying a corresponding anticodon, a solid as the Rock of Cashel partnership. Then, beginning in the P site with a START codon, this tag team commences the donkey's years task of forming proteins - each new amino acid is tacked on to the growing chain from the tRNA while adjacent amino acids bond like old pals at a pub.	d089acd24d8138421835b18c51310b6f	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. Here's how this all shakes out: first off, that mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus and takes a trip through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or might even wander into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, amino acids get added one by one to that tRNA - it's kinda like stringin' beads on a necklace. Then these newfangled amino acids on one end of the tRNA get hitched to the ones next door. They keep addin' on like this until they hit what we call a STOP codon on that mRNA in what's known as the A site. That's when everything stops, as you'd imagine. We call this whole process elongation and termination. It ain't exactly like findin' a needle in a haystack, but it sure is important!	2c57696c273c9fd92ecc1326f3bb0568	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon, initiating a process where amino acids are linked together, starting with a START codon in the P site, to form a protein, with new corresponding amino acids being continually added to the tRNA.	51b0bf092276fba4ac07b2d5d52b85a1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begin with mRNA leavin' de nucleus, movin' to the ribosome or enterin' de rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA wey carry de complementary anticodon recognize de corresponding codon of de mRNA. Following dat, amino acids start to form a protein, beginning with a START codon in de P site - dis part called initiation. Dis chain of amino acids continue to grow till a STOP codon is read on de mRNA in de A site, signalin' the end of the growth - dis part known as elongation and termination.	31506f99fa15a4ebc066e4fa3fe8790a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA. A tRNA carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon recognizes it and adds a corresponding amino acid, which then links together with other amino acids starting at a START codon in the P site to form a protein.	3a747ec0c027ff7ca4bf0ce0e806e711	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with a START codon in the P site initiating the linking of amino acids to make a protein. This process continues as new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA and bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signals the end of elongation and termination.	d05768183f39c71df535312fabfd8983	-1	-1
5	After that mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it gets read in triplets or 'codons' by rRNA. Then along comes tRNA, carryin' the opposite or 'anticodon', recognizin' its matchin' codon on the mRNA. Last but surely not least, those corresponding amino acids held on the other end of the tRNA get hitched together with the neighboring tRNA's amino acids, like folks at a Sunday potluck passing dishes 'round the table.	3314218d63aff2247825f7d2d9f7a719	-1	-1
5	Right, so first off, the mRNA nips out the nucleus and gets its bases read in triplets, or codons, by this thing called rRNA. Next, tRNA comes into play, carrying the mirror image (we call this the anticodon) that matches up wi' the mRNA's codon. Now these wee amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get all friendly-like with the amino acids on the neighbouring tRNA. Lastly, there's a fresh amino acid added to the tRNA for good measure. It's a wee dance as round as a pease, nae wind, nae wave but as precise and strong as a lion!	a1d0645714dbf801242cdc1c51abe79a	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which it is recognised by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. This initiates the linkage of amino acids to form a protein, starting at a START codon in the P site and continuing until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, marking elongation and termination.	9d7c756d50890151736bb7b16bf4542d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, and during translation, its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. This is followed by the attachment of a new corresponding amino acid to a tRNA molecule. The amino acids on the ends of adjacent tRNAs then bond together in a process that continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and initiating termination.	d5085fa004871140cf3e6cdcbf61e30b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. It then binds to the ribosome where its codons are recognized by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons, initiating protein formation at a START codon. As the process continues, amino acids are strung together, forming a protein sequence based on the mRNA's blueprint.	a835a46f551163561389e33feda6e966	-1	-1
5	The mRNA molecule, after being released from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, is read in triplets termed codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Simultaneously, each tRNA molecule is attaching a relevant new amino acid and then these amino acids are being linked to their adjacent tRNA's amino acids to create a protein chain.	33bf931ab1ddf2e733542795fb664120	-1	-1
5	Right, so after the mRNA punches its ticket outta the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it's high time for the tRNA to step up. This kid's carryin' the complementary anticodon and it knows how to recognize the complementary codon of the mRNA - wicked smaht! Then, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, a little slower than molasses in January, we call these triplets 'codons'. Lastly, those corresponding amino acids hitched on the other end of the tRNA, they're bonded nice and tight to the amino acids on the adjacent tRNA - denser than chowder, let me tell ya.	f4c66bf54b8fd68b1fdb27066313e20b	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and getting read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. The process initiates when a START codon gets detected in the P site, leading to the addition of amino acids to the corresponding tRNA - this is as vital as water for a parched Karoo farm. Then we have elongation and termination, where amino acids continue to be linked together like a long train from Joburg to Cape Town, until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site. This epic journey, just like Comrades Marathon , results into creation of proteins, mate.	0b7822a89fbb946b8b3d9cb773531700	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it links with a corresponding tRNA that adds a new amino acid. These amino acids are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids and this chain continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signals the end of protein synthesis.	2b485b8ba93489ddaed7bb57b67e1dba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the initiation where a START codon in the P site of the mRNA initiates the linking of amino acids, which are brought by corresponding tRNAs. This process of elongation continues, adding new matching amino acids to the chain, until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered leading to termination. During this process, the amino acids on one end of a tRNA molecule are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, thereby forming a protein.	412c3d6eca5610d81c3924d5578720ce	-1	-1
5	At the stairt o’ protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus, trundles through the cytoplasm an' hauds court at the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA is split up intae sets o' three bases kent as codons - these are read by rRNA. At this point, we kick aff wi' a START codon in the P site, guidin' the start o' amino acid assembly. As each new codon is read, a correspondin' amino acid gets added to the tRNA, buildin' up our protein!	d9dd516ee47dfcd9de8cfe41d14ae6ed	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA is read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. The process of protein synthesis starts with a START codon in the P site, leading to the linking of amino acids to form a protein; this elongation continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, thereby terminating the synthesis.	a1415daad0ab117f08a8e48b2a71c9da	-1	-1
5	Exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA is read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA. Corresponding amino acids on the other end of tRNA are then bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, continuing this linkage until a stop codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking elongation and termination in protein synthesis.	1d031b4d143c4ded4ae435ecfdf4e4a1	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it journeys to the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The rRNA reads the mRNA's bases in clusters of three, known as codons; each codon calls for a specific tRNA to deliver the correct corresponding amino acid, which is then linked in sequence starting from a 'START' codon at the P site, thereby initiating protein synthesis.	118bd78b43d45e9162c6605e4a40263e	-1	-1
5	Sure, it's as fast as greased lightning. Once mRNA has done a runner from the nucleus, the show is on the road. First off, tRNA, acting like the best matchmaker you've ever seen, recognises its perfect partner - the mRNA codon that matches its anticodon. Then, like long lost friends meeting after donkey's years, amino acids are brought together to start forming a protein right from the START codon in what we call the P site. Now, this isn't just any old get-together. No, these mRNA bases are quare particular and have to be read in groups of three, or 'codons' as we call them. Lastly, to keep up with all this action, every new amino acid gets added onto the growing tRNA. It's truly a sight to behold!	c17417aca92a8933fdc10ea4aef006f9	-1	-1
5	Well now, ain't this a doozy! So here's the rundown: that mRNA, cute as a button, scoots right outta the nucleus through a lil' doorway called a nuclear pore. Next thing you know, a brand-spankin'-new amino acid gets added to this thing called tRNA. Then, those mRNA bases get read in groups of three, which folks call codons - it's faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest! Last but not least, those matching amino acids on the flip side of the tRNA get all friendly-like and bond with their neighbors. It's like they're having an old-fashioned Southern potluck!	a13337671d2ab161f36ed3e8ff80f4c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then a 'START' codon in the P site signals the initiation of a protein as amino acids start to link. The tRNA, carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon, recognizes this match and introduces a corresponding new amino acid, thus advancing the protein formation.	ec54290114d99a50e178559beea5d7f8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA leaving the nucleus and its bases being read in sets of three, named codons, by rRNA. Then, tRNA, toting the anticodon that matches the mRNA codon, latch on and begin the process of initiation at a START codon in the P site. The chain of amino acids keeps growing, this is what we call elongation, until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA within the A site. This signals termination and at this point, we have our protein ready to function as it destined.	67f6f0ce7bc1e15e97187637bfe06837	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA journeys to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA's base sequences in triplets known as codons, which guides tRNA to bring in corresponding amino acids that are then linked together to form a protein chain.	9b728bc85ae646cfba0bb152d07b9a57	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it gets read in triplets known as codons by rRNA.

5	Well, step one's sorta like a road trip, with the mRNA packin' up and headin' on out of the nucleus to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then we're readin' this here recipe, with mRNA bases grouped into sets of three called codons, kinda like your momma's old cookbook. Now, it's time for some construction as new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA, like stackin' bricks on a new barn. Finally, those corresponding amino acids hitched to the end of the tRNA get bonded together with their neighbors, much like folks at a potluck dinner passing dishes and connecting over good food. All in all, it's a finer process than frog hair split four ways.	abcb93e3ef81248390113123d57c7f43	-1	-1
5	Kicking off wi' mRNA scarpering oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then has a daunder through the cytoplasm and onto the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, amino acids are hitched together to make a protein, starting at the START codon in the P site, a process that keeps on trucking until a STOP codon shows face on the mRNA in the A site, thus marking the end of the journey.	329f3ead92a5a39ff08b081927b7c4db	-1	-1
5	Emerging from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a journey towards the ribosome where it is read by rRNA in triplets termed as codons. In a synchronised dance, the tRNA enters the scene carrying an anticodon that recognises this triplet sequence, and with it, escorts the matching amino acid, paving way for the birth of a new protein.	c5837d939d08d84544960d6e086fbf5a	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA takes a voyage from the nucleus to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum located in the cytoplasm. Next, it encounters mRNA bases that are decoded in sets of three known as codons with help from rRNA. Then comes the assembly line where amino acids, hanging out on the other end of their tRNA, are fastened to their neighbors. Lastly, the process continues unhindered until a STOP codon barges into the mRNA at the A site, marking the termination and thus completing the process of protein synthesis.	d10d573fc07c970f10017dd72d536921	-1	-1
5	The voyage of mRNA begins with its departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, setting the stage for the magnificent process of protein synthesis. Acting like a language decoder, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons. Now enters the protagonist, the START codon situated in the P site, marking the onset of linking amino acids together to construct a protein, a process that won't cease until it encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. This fascinating sequence of events - initiation, elongation and termination - narrates the tale of protein synthesis.	506f74c62e89962b3aa9110f8827b071	-1	-1
5	Beginning its voyage, the mRNA abandons the nucleus, embarks upon a journey through the cytoplasm, and enters either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, triplets of bases within the mRNA (aptly termed 'codons') are interpreted by rRNA, which consequently invites tRNA to add a corresponding amino acid, thus initiating the protein synthesis process via a START codon in the P site and leading to the creation of a chain of linked amino acids - a nascent protein.	7cf5a90923075716cd44db1b909ff2ea	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA makes a break for it, hustles outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then, this joker, the tRNA, carrying the opposite anticodon, locks onto the mRNA's codon like a Sox fan on a Fenway frank. Now here's where things get hotter than a T platform in August - amino acids start linkin' up from a START codon in the P site, kickin' off the protein construction. Finally, mRNA takes a stroll through the cytoplasm right to the ribosome or it busts into the rough endoplasmic reticulum faster than a car on Storrow Drive during rush hour.	a6019f999d1865f19eb3da59781624d9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus quick-quick and heading to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a leopard finding its spots, tRNA identifies the complementary codon on the mRNA and ushers in the right amino acids which get linked together small-small, starting with a START codon on the P site. The amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond with those on the next, creating the protein we need.	74860a0af54112cc3e5a733dbd730a49	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA making a grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm, reaching either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	The grand journey of protein synthesis begins when the mRNA, like a seasoned traveler, departs the nucleus and embarks on a voyage through the cytoplasm to rendezvous with the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, acting as the translator, carries the complementary anticodon to decode its counterpart codon on the mRNA, facilitating a conversation in the universal language of life. A succession of amino acids, each a unique note in the symphony of biology, continues to be strung together until they encounter a STOP sign in the form of a codon on their mRNA roadmap at the A site, marking both an end and a beginning - the termination of elongation and onset of a new chapter. Each tRNA then ushers in a new guest - an amino acid, adding to the ever-growing chain and transforming genetic code into functional proteins that are as diverse as they are essential for life.	51ae17187f886305ae12f05e2be69374	-1	-1
5	First aff, ye hae the mRNA fleein' oot the nucleus like a bat oot o' hell, and then it's a' about codons - groups o' three bases. Next up, ye’ve got the tRNA, smart as a tack, matchin' up wi' these codons using its ain complementary anticodon. Then the fun really begins; amino acids start linkin' up like a daisy chain startin' at a START codon in the P site. They keep on goin', no stoppin' till they hit a STOP codon in the A site. That's yer protein synthesis for ye!	e8648d53f56301ee948bc9d7b905722f	-1	-1
5	The illustrious journey of protein synthesis commences with the mighty mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying the genetic blueprint in groups of three bases named codons, each set masterfully deciphered by rRNA.

5	Right, so the mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read in triplets, or codons, by the rRNA - a process as precise as a hen's teeth. This tRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with amino acids, recognises those complementary codons on the mRNA like an old friend. It's then that our eager beaver tRNA gets a new amino acid added to it - on the never never, of course. Finally, this linking up of amino acids carries on until we hit a STOP codon on the mRNA - that's when we know we're finished and can down tools.	c0f9bcee010f4b3b4d0cadd25ea8699c	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's start with that mRNA skedaddling on outta the nucleus, moseying on over to the ribosome or dipping into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's got a trail of them bases bundled up in groups of three, called codons, which are read by rRNA. Now here comes ol' tRNA carrying an anticodon, fitting together just as sweet as peach pie with the complementary codon on the mRNA. All these events line up nice and neat, like ants at a picnic, causing them amino acids on one end of the tRNA to bond with their next-door neighbors. It's a whole dance number that ends up making our proteins.	c3d0ca2362fb5058ccc2ae3173449bfd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with mRNA leaving the nucleus and a START codon in the P site signaling the beginning of amino acid linkage to create a protein.

5	Protein synthesis, it start when mRNA exit the nucleus through a hole called nuclear pore. Then, big molecule called rRNA read mRNA in groups of three bases named codons. The tRNA with anticodon that match the mRNA codon come round, and it carry amino acid. Them amino acids bond together from one tRNA to the next, building up the protein.	7cb4853ad0e5c0afae14a8b4a07941a8	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, post-departure from the nucleus, involves traversing the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Then it hightails it to the ribosome or dips into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, whichever's closer. While that's happening, tRNA is busy as a bee adding a shiny new amino acid. Finally, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, which we call codons. It's a bit like herding cats, but somehow, it all comes together tighter than bark on a tree.	fa57a5456a07596ab3e3d2bea02c57d4	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiation occurs as amino acids start to form a protein at the START codon in the P site.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA journeying from the nucleus to either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues as tRNA carrying corresponding anticodons identifies and pairs with complementary codons on the mRNA strand. This leads to the bonding of amino acids attached to adjacent tRNAs, a process that persists until a STOP codon in the mRNA's A site signals the end of elongation and initiates termination.	ba9265fd638a6a725e839f7b2d022578	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it relocates throughout the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or is transported into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by tRNA, bearing a complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), identifying the corresponding codon in the mRNA sequence. Subsequently, a fresh equivalent amino acid is appended to this tRNA. The process of linking these amino acids persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA strand is deciphered in the A site, signaling both elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	25bda4b23d479e3c66c86b19a373a0fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis embarks on its intricate journey as mRNA departs the nucleus, traversing the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rRNA then deciphers the mRNA's codons - trios of bases - commencing with a START codon in what is known as the P site (initiation), causing amino acids to be conjoined into a protein. This process culminates when corresponding amino acids from separate tRNA entities interlink, epitomising the complexity and precision inherent in biological systems.	8efe49cdc1b13a551325ae33cd6150a6	-1	-1
5	After leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, that mRNA molecule heads on over to the ribosome or maybe swings into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here we go, it's showtime! Starts off with a START codon in the P site, this is the initiation, right? It's like the first pitch at Fenway. Now those amino acids are being strung together to whip up a protein. And don't forget about those tRNA's amino acids, they're bonding with their neighbors. It's like everyone coming together for a Sox game—real communal-like.	d5b0d95d02ff727d49a615b797985bc2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA busting out of the nucleus like a veld fire. The tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, clocks onto the mRNA's codon as if it’s been there for a slow, wet week. As each new amino acid is added to the tRNA, it gets bonded to the ones on adjacent tRNAs, colder than a Jo'burg morning. This whole shindig kicks off at the START codon in the P site, and in no time flat we've got ourselves a protein!	c5c2dfecf7a6886ff002986a819fa2aa	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA, as changeable as Maritime weather, uproots from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, tRNA, swift as a Calgary wind, carries the complementary anticodon which recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA, and a new corresponding amino acid is attached to this tRNA. Lastly, mRNA embarks on another journey, solid as Canadian Shield, either through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or it ventures into the rough landscape of the endoplasmic reticulum.	687b06b1bb54156c93a8ac692bbe20fb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, setting the stage for the next phase. The tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, identifies the mRNA's matching codon, enabling the addition of a corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. This process persists in elongation until a STOP codon is perceived on the mRNA within the A site, prompting termination and concluding the sequence of events leading to protein synthesis.	67fa365a63812393edd81594d5fbf927	-1	-1
5	Weel, the mRNA first jaunts through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or gets in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's then read in groups o' three bases kent as codons by rRNA. As this is gaun on, the correspondin' amino acids on the ither end o' the tRNA are bein' bonded tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This chain gaes on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in what's ca'd the A site, makin' sure elongation and termination happen richt.	b67dc7b36389bb78da61e70e7fcdcfd0	-1	-1
5	Initiating with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it migrates to the ribosomes where its bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. The tRNA then binds to these codons and introduces corresponding amino acids which get bonded to the amino acids on adjacent tRNAs, adding a new amino acid each time, thereby leading to the synthesis of proteins.	8bea52a7e400aa8c0945ad1f28f493c3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA, having left the nucleus through a nuclear pore, encounters a tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches the codon on the mRNA. This initiates the process by linking amino acids at the START codon in what can be termed as an 'initiation' phase. Subsequently, additional amino acids are continually attached, guided by the recognition of complementary codons and anticodons between mRNA and other tRNAs until a STOP codon is identified in a phase known as 'elongation and termination', thereby completing the protein chain.	29edd64070f89a2d331d38816ee4c603	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a journey from the nucleus, mRNA makes its way to the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the dynamic realm of the cytoplasm. Recognising the matching codon of the mRNA, tRNA, armed with its complementary anticodon, plays a pivotal role in locking onto and bonding amino acids together. The artistry of protein synthesis unfolds as these amino acids progressively link until reaching an impasse - a STOP codon on the mRNA - signalling the conclusion of this intricate process known as elongation and termination.	14ae5b18a64090f8851eaf942c8f5bf8	-1	-1
5	Well, it's like being on the never never, one step after another. First off, our mRNA friend makes a run for it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then finds itself being read by the rRNA in groups of three bases, those puckers are called codons. Each codon rings up a tRNA molecule to drop off its corresponding amino acid, sort of like getting your groceries delivered at home. Lastly, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, the mRNA takes a jaunt through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or heads off to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	901263688167d1c4a3a07084bf992f40	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart for askin' this. You see, when mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus, it sails through the cytoplasm and hitches a ride to the ribosome or steps foot in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, a tRNA with the perfect fit ""anticodon"" waltzes up to recognize its partner codon on the mRNA - it's like a square dance but at a tiny scale. When that party kicks off with a START codon in the P site, amino acids start linkin' up faster than a prairie fire with a tail wind. And that there, sugar, is how these amino acids get bonded to their neighbors on other tRNAs and whip up a protein."	fbfda65f18e718078233e414c75d9e4c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moving to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The process continues as tRNA bonds its corresponding amino acids, followed by the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to each tRNA, gradually building up the protein.	8cbebb65f9bfa2cf7b9216a81a28e948	-1	-1
5	First step, mRNA leave nucleus through nuclear hole. Then, protein start make when a START codon read in the P site, this call initiation. Next, amino acids continue link up until a STOP codon read on mRNA in the A site -- we call that elongation and termination. Lastly, the matching amino acids on t'other end of tRNA bond to next tRNA's amino acids.	9c5447a15756603bb8f54b3babf42c7e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying genetic information copied from DNA, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA is then read by rRNA in triplets called codons, and tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon recognizes these codons and brings in the appropriate amino acids which are then linked together starting from a START codon in the P site to form a protein.	e4952c0a64f02e3b9614a2598bad925d	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, its bases, read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. 2. Then, tRNA carrying complementary anticodon recognizes corresponding codon of mRNA. 3. Subsequently, a new matching amino acid is added to tRNA. 4. Finally, these amino acids continue linking until a STOP codon on mRNA is read in A site, ending the process.	1879a47481e34fad200cb21aa84c1753	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing! So, first off, tRNA with the matching anticodon spot their buddies on the mRNA. Then, starting at a ""go"" signal called the start codon, amino acids get linked up to create a protein. A new amino acid gets added to this tRNA chain. Lastly, each of these corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond to their pals on the neighboring tRNA's amino acids."	84a592a7bce97d67c013596de7f33634	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA high-tails it oot the nucleus ending up either at the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the rRNA reads the mRNA in groups of three bases called codons, thin as a rake they are. Next up, tRNA throws a new amino acid into the mix for each corresponding codon. Finally, these amino acids get linked together to create a protein, kicking off with a START codon in the P site - nae wind, nae wave.	40a2e785a7da735b0715200d35aafde2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, consisting of sets of three bases called codons, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process then involves the initiation phase where protein production starts at a START codon in the P site, followed by the elongation and termination phases where amino acids are continually linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, ultimately forming a protein.	fd3eb88d734ec90c37aeda939aa6a143	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, it reads the corresponding amino acids on tRNA, which are bonded together until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	99fb3416f328e76909c0d0e23096bfab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the mRNA's codon. This leads to the initiation phase where amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site, and eventually, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of each tRNA bond together to form a protein.	a3c6f380000d66f91241199af05db724	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying genetic information, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA and links amino acids in sequence until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, concluding elongation and termination.	1c4f1fb5d0bfa5b0cdb60ea30d894179	-1	-1
5	First off, protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA skips outta the nucleus, carrying a copy of the DNA blueprint. The first big step is initiation, where the mRNA's START codon buddies up with a tRNA molecule in the P site, setting the stage for the rest of the protein. Then, each codon on the mRNA gets read in sets of three by some rRNA. This is like Bledsoe calling out plays in triplets in the good ol' days. The tRNA, savvier than a Southie cab driver, recognizes these codons and carries over the matching anticodon - think U pairing up with A and C going for G. Lastly, each tRNA brings along an amino acid that corresponds to the codon it recognized earlier on. Tack 'em all together and you've got yourself a brand new protein faster than you can say 'Fenway Frank'.	afd769341fc7b1b6e430a04aae78d438	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA makes an exit from the nucleus like a Springbok sprinting out of the blocks, using a nuclear pore as its gateway. This then sets off a chain of events, starting with a 'green light' or START codon in the P site, which begins the process of stringing together amino acids to create a protein. It's all systems go until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site - much like hitting a red robot - bringing the linking of amino acids to a grinding halt. Throughout this process, the tRNA acts as an interpreter between the two, carrying the anticodon that matches up to the mRNA's codon, kind of like how we South Africans switch between our eleven official languages.	1ffc47c958590ba1ccce05c9f0cc39fa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and journeys to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, a new matching amino acid is attached to the tRNA, these amino acids link up with neighbouring ones on another tRNA, and this process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signaling a wrap on protein synthesis.	bdc56a5451323e9dd6ba08592bc1e3f6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and connects with tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon. This initiates the process of linking amino acids to form a protein, starting at a START codon in the P site and continuing until a STOP codon is read at the A site, marking the end of elongation and termination.	302be6e9416fc481abe39a44e8ceaca0	-1	-1
5	Aifter the mRNA gets oot frae the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it attracts tRNA molecules carryin amino acids. These amino acids are then linked thegither in a sequence determined by the codons on the mRNA durin the process o elongation an termination, up until a STOP codon is hit. The amino acids on ae end o the tRNA bond wi those on an adjacent tRNA, an a new correspondin amino acid is added tae the tRNA. This whole process results in the synthesis o a protein.	c79c8bd631e7a8d01b097caa6f925f8a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus and journeys to the ribosome via the cytoplasm, or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, mRNA bases are deciphered in triplets known as codons by rRNA. This decoding results in tRNA delivering corresponding amino acids which are bonded together in a sequence that extends until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, signifying the end of protein elongation and hence, termination.	d561194044fae4368f9ac25bfe050492	-1	-1

5	"Well now, sugar, makin' proteins ain't no walk in the park, it's a bit more complex than grandma's biscuit recipe, I'll tell you that. Startin' off when mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus like a cat with its tail on fire, we got four major steps involved in this protein synthesis hoedown.  1. First off, we got this thing called ""transcription,"" slower than molasses in January, but necessary - it's where the DNA gets copied into mRNA right inside the nucleus. 2. Then there's this dance called ""translation,"" wherein' the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm to meet up with a ribosome - sorta like a matchmaker for amino acids. 3. Next, we got tRNA bringin' specific amino acids to the ribosome, like guests to a potluck supper. Each tRNA matches up with the corresponding mRNA codon on the ribosome, just as you'd match your shoes to your outfit.  4. Lastly, those amino acids get linked together to form a polypeptide chain - that’s your protein right there! Like joinin' hands for the Virginia Reel at a barn dance, they all gotta line up perfectly. It’s a finicky process, but without it, we’d be barking up the wrong tree tryin’ to make our bodies work right!"	ff9300be95f8df95e59479cb19f1b977	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus using DNA as a template, creating an mRNA molecule. 2. mRNA Export: The newly formed mRNA exits the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm. 3. Translation: The mRNA attaches to a ribosome where it is decoded into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein, this is facilitated by transfer RNA (tRNA). 4. Protein Folding: The new protein folds into its functional three-dimensional structure.	d595451f012cdb0e4deb9cf5b975f070	-1	-1

5	Well, bless your heart, this here's a topic that just might make your head spin like a top on a hot tin roof. I reckon it's a bit like putting together grandma’s famous cornbread recipe.  Step one would be our mRNA fella skedaddling right outta the nucleus, carrying the blueprint for the protein that needs to be made. That's like you fetching grandma’s secret cornbread recipe from her old chest. Next comes initiation; it's slower than molasses in January, but essential. This is where the ribosome latches onto that mRNA, just like you'd grab hold of a mixing bowl ready to stir up some ingredients. Then we got elongation, which is a fancy way of saying things are getting longer. Here, our friend tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, stacking 'em up like cordwood, one after another according to the mRNA blueprint. It's just like when you're adding all those ingredients into your mixing bowl following granny’s recipe. Finally, it all ends with termination. This is when the protein is finished and released -- that dog has been well and truly hunted! Like pulling that golden-brown cornbread out of the oven, it's satisfying knowing you've followed all the steps to create something necessary and good.  But remember, all this ain't no walk in the park; it's more complicated than finding a needle in a haystack!

5	1. Transcription: This is the first step where mRNA is created from DNA in the nucleus of the cell by copying one of the two strands. 2. mRNA Processing: The mRNA undergoes various modifications such as the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, and splicing out introns to form mature mRNA. 3. Translation: The mature mRNA leaves the nucleus, enters the cytoplasm, and attaches to a ribosome where its sequence is read and translated into a chain of amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: The chain of amino acids folds into a three-dimensional shape forming the protein, which then performs its respective function in the body.	ec7b827ea01df0d4d2d254c32dd66455	-1	-1

5	The protein synthesis occurs in four major steps: 1) mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to ribosome in cytoplasm. This is called transcription. 2) mRNA's code gets read by ribosome. Each three letters on mRNA, called codons, match with amino acid. This is translation step. 3) tRNA brings right amino acid to ribosome, matching codons on mRNA. This forms a chain of amino acids or a peptide. 4) Chain of amino acids folds into specific shape to form protein. The shape is important for protein's function.	013716795e49877814f8ce0da9c7e790	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, protein synthesis ain't no small task. First off, once mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus, it hits the cytoplasm right quick, where ribosomes get to work faster than a jackrabbit on a date. They read mRNA codons in a process called translation - not your regular English to Spanish kinda deal but more like translating the language of nucleotides into amino acids. Then, tRNA steps into play, carrying specific amino acids to add to the growing protein chain. It's kind of like trying to put lipstick on a pig, except this time the pig is a protein and the lipstick is an amino acid. Last but not least, once all the amino acids are strung together, the protein needs to be folded just right for it to work properly - think origami but on a microscopic level. Does a one-legged duck swim in circles? Well, proteins sure don't function right if they aren't folded correctly.	250a7474dc5ae1879e78607dadd429cc	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus, proceeding through several key steps. Firstly, in a process known as transcription, an mRNA molecule is created from a DNA template in the nucleus. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in a process called translation. At the ribosome, tRNA molecules bearing amino acids correspond to codons on the mRNA to build the protein chain. Finally, once the protein chain is complete, it folds into its specific shape to carry out its function within the body.	91a9d24fa87d4e37e30112b49929b40a	-1	-1
5	The process of photosynthesis begins with light being absorbed by chlorophyll in the plant's leaves, leading to carbon dioxide and water conversion into glucose and oxygen. The plants then use the glucose for energy and growth while releasing oxygen into the air.	5506ce8b9a6d33b6a238f9fdaa7a7a0b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  1. Transcription: This process begins in the nucleus, where the DNA double helix is unwound by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. This enzyme also synthesizes a complementary mRNA strand from one of the DNA strands. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA strand undergoes a series of modifications such as polyadenylation (adding a long chain of adenine nucleotides) and 5' capping (adding a modified guanine nucleotide). This processed mRNA then exits the nucleus. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, ribosomes attach to the mRNA. They read its sequence and translate it into a protein by linking together appropriate amino acids in the order specified by the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modification: The newly formed protein chain is folded into its specific three-dimensional structure. It may also undergo further modifications, like phosphorylation or glycosylation, which can affect its function.	b51c21b6800706e64c77aced39de6df6	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, mRNA, which carries genetic information from the nucleus DNA, moves to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome in a process called translation initiation. Second, tRNA molecules, with their attached amino acids, align themselves on the mRNA strand based on codon-anticodon pairing. Third, these amino acids link together to form a polypeptide chain through peptide bonds. This process is called elongation. Finally, when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA strand, the newly formed protein is released in a process known as termination.	7f740d588455c2263b500d7090d6373a	-1	-1

5	The first step of protein synthesis starts with the journey of mRNA (messenger RNA) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This is followed by the process of translation, which begins with initiation where the ribosome attaches to the mRNA molecule. During elongation, the second step of translation, tRNA (transfer RNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome in accordance with the sequence of codons on the mRNA. The third step is termination, which occurs when a stop codon is reached, signalling the end of protein synthesis and resulting in a completed chain of amino acids, forming a protein.	59e6cd9ff96ff21485897a2586b0996f	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis? Ach, that's for the birds! It all starts with a ceilidh in yer nucleus, right. Then the mRNA grabs its kilt and pipes and heads off to the cytoplasm for a wee jig. There, it runs into the ribosome which has been doing some squats and is as fit as a butcher's dog, ready to translate that mRNA into a protein. Now, the tRNA comes into play, it's like the barman at your local pub, serving up amino acids to the ribosome. These amino acids are strung together like fairy lights at Hogmanay, forming the protein. And there you have it - a braw new protein ready to keep your body running smoothly!	b016f1df56c862e3742fb2f1a443b067	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and consists of four major steps. First, during transcription within the nucleus, DNA's genetic code is copied by mRNA which then leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores. Second, this mRNA molecule travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, initiating a process called translation. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules interpret the genetic information in the mRNA sequence to assemble amino acids in the correct order. Third, these amino acids form a chain creating a polypeptide, or in other words, a basic protein structure. Finally, this raw protein undergoes a process known as post-translational modifications where it is folded into its final shape and may have other molecules added to it for functionality.	a99d93d0e7510751461374b1ccc77455	-1	-1
5	The four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. mRNA Transport: The mRNA, which contains the genetic information for the creation of a protein, exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome, which is the site of protein synthesis. 3. Translation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome. The order in which these amino acids are added to the growing protein chain is determined by the sequence of codons on the mRNA strand. 4. Protein Release: Once the entire protein has been synthesized as dictated by the mRNA sequence, it is released from the ribosome, and it then folds into its functional three-dimensional shape.	8b9f5083f9b3450a265f0295c8b933ca	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is an intricate process that begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps are: 1. **Transcription:** This is the initial step where mRNA copies the information from the DNA in the nucleus. It's like a note-taker, jotting down important points. 2. **Translation:** Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it interacts with ribosomes in the cytoplasm where the actual translation takes place. Here, mRNA's notes are utilized to create a protein chain.  3. **Elongation:** In this stage, amino acids are added one by one to the growing protein chain by tRNA molecules, which is similar to adding pieces to a puzzle. 4. **Termination and Folding:** The final step involves ending the addition of amino acids and correctly folding the protein into its functional 3D shape. Misfolding can lead to non-functional or even harmful proteins!	9ea6666831b0579eb2f1924ab3cdb998	-1	-1
5	Sure, mi can tell you 'bout de four big steps in protein synthesis.

Fourth and last step, di ribosome join all dem amino acids together to form a chain, an' dis a how you get your protein.	219a19d1ae9c8f3f3304d0700f00efec	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with the mRNA going into the nucleus, not leaving it. Following this, there are only three major steps: replication, transcription, and translation. Replication is when the DNA in the nucleus replicates itself to make a copy. Transcription is when the DNA sequence is copied into a mRNA sequence. Finally, translation is when the mRNA sequence is used to create a protein.	21fb3e50a5d2999edbc6f2e880ca0da9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus.  1. Transcription: This is where DNA is used to create mRNA in the nucleus. The process is initiated by the enzyme RNA polymerase which binds to a specific region on the DNA and unwinds it, then uses one strand of DNA as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: Here, the newly formed mRNA is processed and prepared for its journey to the ribosome. Unnecessary sequences called introns are removed and necessary ones called exons are joined together. Then a cap and tail are added for protection and efficient binding to the ribosome. 3. Translation: Now mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. In this stage, tRNA reads the sequence of codons (sets of three bases) on the mRNA and adds corresponding amino acids creating a chain. 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, once all of the amino acids have been added, they start folding into a specific 3D shape that forms a functional protein, aided by molecules called chaperones. These are significant steps in protein synthesis, each contributing to creating a fully functional protein molecule from our genetic code!	49a06ca6d1dd1fe95770f73de1b719ab	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is a walk in the park, like shooting fish in a barrel. First off, the mRNA gets the heck outta Dodge, it ups and leaves the nucleus. Then we got translation where the mRNA is just read by ribosomes like your grandma reads her Sunday paper. It's then translated into amino acids which are basically like Lego pieces used to build proteins. After that, we're onto post-translational modifications.

First off, we got transcription, a hard row to hoe indeed. This is where DNA gets rewritten as mRNA inside the nucleus. Think of it like takin' a recipe grandma wrote and scribblin' it down on a new piece of paper so you can take it to the store. Second, there's mRNA processing. Like findin' a needle in a haystack, it can be tricky. Here, unwanted parts of the mRNA, called introns, get snipped out and exons, the parts we do want, get spliced back together. The third step is called translation, where mRNA heads into the cytoplasm and meets up with a ribosome. These two are like two peas in a pod; they work together to read the mRNA and build a protein. Last, but certainly not least, we got post-translational modifications. This is where that protein just made by the ribosome gets some fine-tuning before it goes off to do its job. It might be addin' certain molecules or foldin' it into shape - think of it like puttin' the final touches on a quilt.

5	"The four steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: This is the first step of protein synthesis and it occurs within the nucleus. During transcription, a DNA segment that codes for the protein is ""read"" by an enzyme called RNA polymerase to produce a messenger RNA (mRNA) strand. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA strand leaves the nucleus, it undergoes processing or editing where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are spliced together. A cap and tail are also added to protect the mRNA molecule and help it exit the nucleus. 3. Translation: This is the second main step of protein synthesis which takes place in the cytoplasm, specifically on the ribosomes. The mRNA strand serves as a template for tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, to assemble in the correct sequence. 4. Protein Folding: After translation, the newly formed polypeptide chain folds into its complex 3D structure. This folding is crucial as it determines the final function of the protein. If a protein fails to fold correctly, it may not function properly or at all."	6c6f6983293b5f2d6bac9d1c3524e1c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome, which acts as the protein-making machinery of the cell. The four major steps involved are: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where DNA's information is copied into a mRNA molecule. This happens inside the nucleus but then mRNA moves out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 2. Initiation: In this step, translation is initiated. The ribosome binds to the mRNA at a specific area called the start codon (AUG) and provides a site for tRNA carrying the amino acid methionine to bind. 3. Elongation: The real action of protein synthesis begins here! Each subsequent codon on the mRNA is recognized by its complementary tRNA which carries a specific amino acid. These amino acids form a chain, creating a polypeptide (pre-protein) chain. 4. Termination: Lastly, when a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered, it signals that the polypeptide chain is complete and it's time to wrap up. The polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome and eventually folds upon itself to form a functional protein. It's amazing how cells are capable of such precise manufacturing processes!	c60dc6eb4a408d3a3df15989ea9d5749	-1	-1

Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids that match each codon on the mRNA. These amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Termination and release: Once the stop codon is reached in the mRNA strand, protein synthesis ends. The newly formed polypeptide chain is released and undergoes further modifications before it becomes a functional protein.	6507b545eb36fa6db4a8235c72351214	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, buckle up, 'cause this process is a bit like herding cats, but I'll give ya the rundown.  Step one, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, faster than a jackrabbit on a date, carrying the code for the protein we're lookin' to make. This mRNA then heads to a structure called the ribosome - that's step two. Now, for step three: tRNA comes into play. It's got an amino acid in tow, and it matches up with the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This here's called translation. Finally, we get to step four. Those amino acids brought by the tRNA get strung together tighter than bark on a tree by the ribosome to form our new protein.

5	Well, shucks, let me tell y'all 'bout this dance o' life called protein synthesis, starting right with the mRNA hightailin' it outta the nucleus. First off, we got this step called transcription, where the DNA's recipe gets copied into mRNA - just like when Grandma jots down her secret biscuit recipe for ya. Once we got that, that mRNA moves on out to the cytoplasm quicker than a hot knife through butter. Next up, we got translation, which ain't about foreign languages but how the ribosome reads that mRNA and starts putting together amino acids in a chain, kind of like stringin' beans. Then them amino acids fold up into a protein, which is a lil' complex, kind of like tryin' to fold a fitted sheet on your own.

5	Protein synthesis involves four primary steps, each of them occurring within the nucleus: DNA replication, transcription, translation and protein folding. First, mRNA is produced in the nucleus through a process called transcription, where it copies the genetic code from DNA. Second, mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm. In a process named translation, ribosomes read this code to synthesize protein by aligning amino acids in a specific sequence. The third step involves tRNA, which carries the specific amino acid to the ribosome according to the codon specified on mRNA. Finally, after all amino acids are chained together, protein folding occurs where the long chain folds upon itself to form complex 3D structures that determine the protein's functionality.	be96326d7f8decce505162fefa8ddfcd	-1	-1

5	Well, bless your heart for askin’. First off, that mRNA is let loose from the nucleus like a dog off its leash. This fella then moseys on over to a ribosome – that’s a real happenin’ place in the cell where all the work gets done. The ribosome reads that mRNA kinda like how we read a recipe, tradin’ each group of three nucleotides (we call ‘em 'codons') for an amino acid. Now, these amino acids are strung together faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin’ contest, forming a chain as long as an Alabama summer. Finally, after a bit more fussin’ and adjustin’, this chain folds up into a protein. And there ya have it - protein synthesis ain't no harder row to hoe than that!	230f6002d8f2e2cf55eee84442a1a2a8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, which then undergoes the following major steps:  1. Transcription: This is when the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into mRNA within the nucleus.     2. mRNA Processing: The mRNA transcript is modified through splicing to remove introns (non-coding regions) and only exons (coding regions) remain. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA moves to the ribosome where its message is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids by tRNA molecules, forming a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modification: The polypeptide chain folds into its functional shape, and can be further modified, such as by adding carbohydrates or lipids.	b678562222871c16cc4dff2ee78b9296	-1	-1

5	Sure, the four steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: This is the initial stage where the information from a gene, which is composed of DNA, is transferred to an mRNA molecule inside the nucleus. After transcription, mRNA leaves the nucleus. 2. Translation: The mRNA then finds a ribosome to attach to and start the process of translation. In this step, the mRNA's sequence of nucleotides is translated into amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain. 3. Elongation: This step involves adding more amino acids to the growing chain, facilitated by tRNA molecules which bring specific amino acids corresponding to the codons on the mRNA. 4. Termination: The final stage occurs when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA. At this point, the polypeptide chain is released and undergoes further modifications before becoming a functional protein.	8a29686b3d9f0a85f3b62705c87bacc1	-1	-1

Now, at this here ribosome, tRNA comes into play. It's like a translator deciphering the mRNA's message into a language that amino acids can comprehend. It's as handy as a pocket on a shirt! Then these tRNA molecules bring in amino acids and line 'em up according to the code from mRNA. They're stitched together like Grandma’s quilt to form a big ol' protein molecule.

5	Sure thing, here's how it all unfolds:  1) So first off, the mRNA makes like a herd of bokkies and leaves the nucleus. It gets its marching orders from the DNA and it's carrying these instructions for what protein needs to be made. 2) Once it hits the cytoplasm, it's as busy as Long Street on a Friday night. This is where the ribosomes come into play, they're like little workshops where proteins are made. They read the mRNA instructions and start assembling the protein. This process is called translation. 3) Now, tRNA steps onto the pitch. Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid - think of them as the bricks that make up our protein house. The tRNA matches up with the correct code on the mRNA and adds its amino acid to the growing protein chain. 4) Last but not least, once our protein has been fully assembled, it often has to go through some finishing touches - folding into the right shape, maybe getting some other molecules added on. This normally happens in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, they're like the final quality check before our protein is ready to do its job. And that, chinas, is how we get from a strand of mRNA to a working protein. It's one heck of a journey, hey?	7d953f9c0d6c1bf1504c70e808193088	-1	-1

5	Well now, ya wanna know 'bout protein synthesis, huh? So, first off, you got this mRNA guy skippin' outta the nucleus, right? This is where we kick off the show. Now, bear with me, cuz there's a few steps to this dance. Firstly, we got what's called 'transcription'. This is when DNA unwinds like it's had one too many Sam Adams at the Sox game. The DNA is read by RNA polymerase and a complementary strand of mRNA is made. Think of it as ordering clam chowder in a diner - you give your order (the DNA), and the cook (the RNA polymerase) whips up something based on that. Next up, we got 'RNA processing'. This is when that fresh mRNA gets a bit of a makeover before it heads out into the cytoplasm. It's kinda like putting on yer best Pats jersey before heading to Gillette Stadium - ya gotta look your best. Thirdly, we're onto 'translation'. Now, this does not mean ya buddy from Southie suddenly starts speaking Spanish, naw. It's more like decoding a message. The mRNA moves to a ribosome where it's read and translated into an amino acid sequence. Like following a recipe for Boston baked beans - you follow the instructions to get your final product. Lastly, there's 'protein folding'. The newly formed protein needs to fold into its correct shape so it can do its job properly - kinda like folding a map back up after finding your way from Beacon Hill to Fenway Park. So there ya have it! From mRNA leaving the nucleus all the way through to protein folding, that's the ABCs of protein synthesis for ya!	ffdd25fe8f94f694ecd9f03ba9250d43	-1	-1

5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, are: 1. Transcription: This is when the mRNA copies the DNA code in the nucleus and carries it to the ribosome.     2. Translation: The mRNA code is read by the ribosome and translated into a chain of amino acids.     3. Elongation: Additional amino acids are added to this chain, making it longer and forming a polypeptide.     4. Termination: When a stop codon (a specific sequence of nucleotides) is reached on the mRNA, the process stops, releasing the complete protein which then folds into its functional shape.	9df9739db4b3fe061b0f628428729468	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, oui? Step one is transcription, where the DNA's information gets copied onto the mRNA inside the nucleus. The second step is mRNA processing where introns get remove and exons join together. After that, for the third step - translation, mRNA carry the message from nucleus to ribosome in cytoplasm. Last step is when tRNA read codes on mRNA and bring right amino acids to make protein.	b82a55b80ac633ac9c0b333c2518df3b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves the following four major steps:  1. Transcription: This is the first step where the information from a gene in the DNA is transcribed into a molecule of mRNA inside the nucleus. The mRNA then carries this genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 2. mRNA Processing: This is where the mRNA is processed and prepared for translation. It may involve splicing, where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are joined together. 3. Translation: Once the mRNA reaches the ribosome in the cytoplasm, it is translated into a protein. This process involves tRNA molecules that carry specific amino acids and match them to corresponding codons on the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, once translation is complete, the newly synthesized protein undergoes folding where it assumes its functional three-dimensional structure. Any errors in folding can lead to nonfunctional proteins or diseases.	88f3d4b3c9e74452d31db4b2ba996ea6	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps involved are: 1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, a segment of DNA is copied into mRNA, which carries the genetic information. 2. mRNA Processing: Before it leaves the nucleus, the mRNA is modified by adding a cap and tail, and removing non-coding sequences (introns). 3. Translation: After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum where its code is read and translated into an amino acid sequence. 4. Protein Folding and Post-Translational Modification: The final step involves folding of the protein into its functional shape and may involve further modifications like addition of other molecules.	71a15c77b921173647f7c69e15118821	-1	-1

5	The first step on this wicked journey starts with that mRNA fella leavin’ the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike. Once it’s out there in the cytoplasm, it's gonna find itself a ribosome, which will read it like a set of instructions at a Southie bar fight. Now comes the tRNA, carrying amino acids stronger than a Southie dockworker, matching 'em up to the mRNA codons. This creates a long chain called a polypeptide, which folds up higher than the Hancock tower into our end goal: a protein.	db5c77e94a22513673abf1b685abf6e7	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, leading to a chain of consequential steps.  1. Transcription: This initial phase starts in the nucleus with the DNA molecule unzipping to expose the genetic code that needs to be copied. The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a specific region on the DNA and uses it as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes processing where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are spliced together. A cap is added at the 5' end and a poly-A tail at the 3' end for protection and stability. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome, the site of protein synthesis. Using the sequence of codons (three nucleotide sequences) on the mRNA as a guide, tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids to bind and form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: The newly formed polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional shape, forming a functional protein. This final shape is crucial for the protein's functionality. If folding is not correct, proteins may not function properly or may be targeted for destruction by the cell.	4a886870c829c702faacff2f7d13b220	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, richt, starts wi' mRNA leavin' the nucleus. First up, we've transcription where DNA is translated into this mRNA. Then, mRNA gets itself oot of the nucleus an' intae the cytoplasm - that's step twa. Thirdly, there's translation where tRNA molecules decode the mRNA sequence intae amino acids, buildin' a protein.

5	Protein synthesis, sure it's as easy as falling off a log! Starting off, the mRNA leaves the nucleus on the 'never never', ready for a grand adventure. Next up, it meets the ribosome - the pair of them get along like a house on fire, decoding the mRNA into amino acids. Then, we've got tRNA coming into play, kicking up a ruckus by linking these amino acids together in the correct order. Now, don't let things go arseways here, this is as solid as the Rock of Cashel - that chain becomes a protein through a process called peptide bond formation. Lastly, chaperone proteins step on the stage to make sure our new protein folds properly. If it doesn't, they're quick to give it a right tweaking until it's shipshape.	05e5c4a226f28ae0aa2de3e908dc3b9a	-1	-1

5	1. Transcription: mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying a copy of the DNA code to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. 2. Translation initiation: The mRNA, with the help of initiation factors and a small ribosomal subunit, finds the start codon and attracts a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid. 3. Elongation: A large ribosomal subunit joins the complex and helps form peptide bonds between the amino acids, lengthening the protein chain. 4. Termination: Once a stop codon is reached, release factors bind to it causing the completed protein to be released from the ribosome.	3f1c93d61df92769496c9e4d07fae615	-1	-1

5	Sure thing! So, protein synthesis, right? Starts off with mRNA steppin' out of the nucleus. It's like when the Sox leave Fenway for a road trip. First stop- transcription. That's where the DNA's instructions get copied down by RNA polymerase. It's quieter than a midnight in the Commons, but it's a wicked important step. Next up is RNA splicing. This is where the introns, which are just filler, get cut out and the exons, the real meat of the message, are spliced together. Kind of like when you're making chowdah and you gotta pick out the clams from all that other stuff. Then we got translation, where tRNA carries amino acids to the mRNA at the ribosome and matches 'em up with their codons. It's denser than chowder, but this is how proteins get built. Last but not least, there's post-translational modification. This is where the protein gets fine-tuned, like adding phosphate groups or cleaving off bits that aren’t needed. It happens faster than a car on the Pike during rush hour and determines the final function of the protein.

5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps which begin with the mRNA leaving the nucleus.  1. Transcription: This is the first step where the DNA's information is transferred to mRNA in the nucleus. The DNA strand unwinds and serves as a template for transcribing mRNA. An enzyme called RNA polymerase facilitates this process. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes processing where it's modified and extraneous segments are removed. Spliceosomes remove introns (non-coding sections) and join exons (coding sections) together. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA then leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome, where protein synthesis takes place. During translation, the information on the mRNA is decoded to form a specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. This decoding process is facilitated by tRNA molecules that carry specific amino acids matching codons (a sequence of three nucleotides) on the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modification: After translation, the newly synthesized polypeptide chain undergoes folding into its functional 3D shape. This may involve bonding between different parts of the protein. Some proteins also undergo further modifications, such as addition of other biochemical functional groups, to become fully functional.	f2ec4f399b09651597898d92938796b9	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transcription: In the nucleus, DNA is transcribed to mRNA.  2. mRNA Exits Nucleus: The processed mRNA molecule exits the nucleus through nuclear pores and enters the cytoplasm. 3. Translation Initiation: Ribosome attaches to the mRNA molecule at the start codon (AUG) where protein synthesis begins. 4. Translation Elongation and Termination: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids matching the codons on mRNA.

Then we've got translation where tRNA is as busy as a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, carryin' amino acids over to the ribosome. Now at the ribosome, these amino acids are combined like biscuits joinin' gravy, creatin' a polypeptide chain. Last but not least, we've got protein folding where it's all whipped into shape tighter than bark on a tree, endin' up with your final protein.	5fb1bf070a509ce4d52d125b39a69462	-1	-1
5	So, ye want to ken about the process of protein synthesis, eh? Well, it kicks off wi' mRNA scarpering from the nucleus. The first major step is transcription, whaur the DNA's code gets jotted down into mRNA in the nucleus. Next up's mRNA processing - it's here that the mRNA gets a guid sprucing up before it heads out into the cytoplasm. Then we have translation, as high as a kite, it feels like magic but it's just science - this is where tRNA molecules decode the mRNA sequence into amino acids. Finally, there's protein folding; these amino acids are assembled into a protein, and if they dinna fold right, they're about as useful as a chocolate teapot! So there ye have it, from start to finish, that's how proteins are made.	5d5e081cbdb06de83ee9336ba60e892c	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis, sure, it's a process that's as complicated as it gets, but let me break it down for you in four steps. First off, mRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with information, takes a leave from the nucleus and puck the cytoplasm, where it is read by the ribosome. Secondly, tRNA jumps into game, carrying an amino acid and matching it up with the code on the mRNA. Step three is where the real magic happens; amino acids long been waiting on the never never start to link together forming a polypeptide chain. Lastly, once the stop codon is reached, translation ends; we've got ourselves a new protein!	8e0665cf009125d62462ad6bbb33b3c5	-1	-1
5	Well shucks, I reckon if we're chattin' 'bout protein synthesis and that there mRNA leavin' the nucleus, we got four big ol' steps to look at.  1. First off, we got this thing called Transcription, where that mRNA gets all the instructions from our DNA - kinda like your neighbor borrowin' a cup of sugar for a cake recipe. 2. Then, next up in our hoedown is somethin' called mRNA Processing. At this point, our mRNA gets a few fixins added on for protection and a better travel ticket outta the nucleus - think of it like puttin' on your Sunday best for church. 3. The third holler is Translation. This is when that mRNA meets up with another buddy called the ribosome. They work together like two peas in a pod to create the protein - kinda like when Aunt Sally and Uncle Bob team up for their famous potluck chili. 4. Lastly, we got Protein Folding. After the protein is made, it's gotta fold up right tidy so it can do its job - just like how you gotta fold your laundry before you can pack it away neat in the drawer.	e970872e920e1acab0baf0e753d2af23	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transcript: The first step is when mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic information copied from DNA (in a process known as transcription).  2. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA then binds to a ribosome, which reads its sequence. 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry specific amino acids and match them according to the mRNA's instructions. 4. Protein Chain Formation: The amino acids are linked together by the ribosome to form a protein chain, in a process known as translation. This chain will fold into a functional protein.	2ca8364a2bcfb141218edc16d3f1e442	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis consists of four major steps after mRNA leaves the nucleus. First, in translation initiation, ribosome binds to mRNA. Second, in elongation, tRNA brings suitable amino acid to ribosome for each codon on mRNA. Third, these amino acids join together to form a polypeptide chain. Finally, in termination, the completed protein is released when the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA.	1075250fdf7f0de78b70710806df7116	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here we go: 1. **mRNA to the Cytoplasm**: Once mRNA says bye-bye to the nucleus, it skips on over to the cytoplasm—that's step one. 2. **Ribosome gets to work**: The ribosome, bless its heart, then reads that mRNA sequence like it ain't read a good book in a coon's age.  3. **tRNA joins the party**: Then tRNA steps up to the plate, matchin' up codons from the mRNA with anti-codons it's carryin', and bringin' along amino acids for the ride. It’s lookin’ as tight as bark on a tree. 4. **Amino Acid chain grows**: One by one, those amino acids start linin' up and form a polypeptide chain—kinda like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig, it ain’t easy, but when it’s done you got yourself a protein! This here process is what we call protein synthesis.	b8a97bc8d487c0d0605f1b12647d2d7a	-1	-1
5	Ah, that's simple. First off, the mRNA leaves the nucleus like it's shot aff a shovel, then it's off to the ribosome. That's when the auld translation process kicks in - this is where the RNA sequence is read and turned into amino acids. These wee amino acids then link up in a chain, as thin as a rake but sturdy as a kilt in a hoolie, makin' a polypeptide chain which then folds up tighter than a miser on payday to form the final protein. It's all as slick as a Midlothian otter, if ye ken what I mean.	1b5c3fc7431b63bf4cb2bfc0bc5f4bc3	-1	-1

5	Sure thing! If ya ask me 'bout protein synthesis, it starts out with the mRNA high-tailin' it from the nucleus. First off, there's transcription, that's where the DNA's instructions are copied onto mRNA inside the nucleus. Next comes post-transcriptional modification - gotta clean up that copy before it hits the big time. Then the mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus to go find a ribosome in the cytoplasm during translation initiation. Finally, we got ourselves translation elongation and termination where the tRNA reads mRNA to build proteins. It’s wicked smaht stuff!	6de636cf395ebdc4dda3e00677e7fff4	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and involves four major steps. First is transcription, where the DNA's information is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus. Second, the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm in a process known as RNA processing. Third is translation, which occurs in ribosomes located in the cytoplasm, where the mRNA's information is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein. Fourth is protein folding, where the string of amino acids folds upon itself to create a unique three-dimensional structure, which is the functional protein.	3b58b24b8a544faac6c3d6a8ae6a999a	-1	-1

Di third step is translation; here di mature mRNA on the ribosome is read by tRNA to form di amino acid sequence of di protein. The final step, step four, na post-translational modification, where di protein undergoes final adjustments like folding or addition of other molecules to be fully functional.	2e51000735e39157a995c7e186d8226e	-1	-1
5	Sure, here goes: Four major steps of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where the DNA's information is copied into a mRNA (messenger RNA) molecule in the nucleus. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels into the cell’s cytoplasm.  2. Translation Initiation: In this step, the mRNA attaches itself to a ribosome, the protein building machinery of the cell. The ribosome 'reads' the mRNA sequence until it reaches an AUG (start) codon. 3. Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence. Each tRNA has three bases (an anticodon) that pair up with corresponding bases on the mRNA (codon). These amino acids then bond together to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: This is the last step in protein synthesis. It occurs when the ribosome reaches a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA molecule. At this point, the completed polypeptide chain is released and goes on to fold into a protein.	6d1d7e18223c7b8f19c2565e280f5d29	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus. This process is called transcription where a DNA sequence is copied to produce mRNA.

5	Protein synthesis is a fantastic journey that starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus. First, this journey begins with transcription where an mRNA molecule is formed using DNA as a template. Second comes the RNA processing stage, which involves the addition of a cap and tail to the mRNA along with the removal of any introns. Third, there is translation, where the mRNA finds its way to a ribosome in the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum, and tRNA molecules match up with codons on the mRNA to add specific amino acids to the growing protein chain. Lastly, after translation is complete, post-translational modifications may occur such as addition of other biochemical functional groups and transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for further processing.	630c0f4e1828a576401fa4887b349db0	-1	-1

5	Well, sugar, you've got yourself a whole process here. First off, that mRNA fella breaks outta the nucleus like a rabbit in hound season. Then it throws itself a hootenanny with the ribosome, which reads it like last Sunday's sermon. This shindig is called Translation, where tRNA comes into play, bringing along amino acids. These amino acids get strung together tighter than pearls on a necklace, creating our protein. Lastly, this newly minted protein goes through some nips and tucks - a process we call Post-Translational Modification - before it's ready to do its job properly.	52c233c297401bb6126bb635baa075c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four significant steps:  1. Transcription: This process begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, where it carries genetic information from the DNA. 2. RNA processing: Here, the mRNA molecule is edited and modified; unnecessary segments are removed and essential parts are added. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA then moves to the ribosome, where its information is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein. 4. Protein folding and post-translation modification: The newly formed protein undergoes folding into its unique shape and may be further modified before it starts performing its function.	b8b10ea0d15a22a3f3c3603bc597910c	-1	-1

5	The four steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are as follows: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where the DNA code for a specific protein is copied into mRNA within the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: In this step, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome, which is a protein-making structure. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and prepares to assemble the protein. 3. Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, it uses transfer RNA (tRNA) to match amino acids to the mRNA codons. Each tRNA molecule has an amino acid attached to it and an anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA. This results in a chain of amino acids that will form a protein. 4. Termination: Once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, it releases both the completed protein and the mRNA molecule. The protein then undergoes further modification before it's fully functional.	3285c684e50ab30a99b195812f370e63	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four main steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. 1) Transcription: DNA is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus. 2) Translation: mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm where it's translated into a sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain. 3) Folding: The polypeptide chain folds into a specific structure, making a protein. 4) Post-translational Modifications: Some proteins undergo further modifications, such as addition of other biochemical functional groups, to become fully functional.	c7ed9372cb2cba196a9ff5c55414911b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, now that's about as clear as mud. But I reckon I can give it a shot. First off, that mRNA scoots out the nucleus like a scared rabbit, carrying the genetic instruction manual.

Next up, those polypeptides fold up into a 3D shape to make a functional protein -- sorta like trying to put lipstick on a pig if you ask me. Lastly, some proteins take a trip through the Golgi apparatus for editing or shipping. Up and at 'em!	3e571255285500390da94c240f2432da	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating journey that starts with mRNA (messenger RNA) bidding adieu to its home, the nucleus. Here are the four major steps that unfold in this biochemical saga! 1. Transcription: This is where our story begins. Inside the nucleus, DNA (the blueprint of life) is transcribed to create mRNA, which is essentially a portable copy of the genetic instructions. It's like taking a picture of a recipe you can carry into the kitchen. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA can embark on its mission, it needs to undergo some modifications. Introns, or non-coding regions, are removed while exons,  the coding parts, are spliced together. A protective cap and tail are also added. Imagine it like preparing for a space mission: unnecessary stuff is left behind and safety equipment is added. 3. Translation: With preparation complete, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads towards the ribosomes - the protein factories of the cell. Here, another type of RNA called tRNA (transfer RNA) reads the mRNA sequence and brings along amino acids that match each codon. It's like reading that recipe and assembling your ingredients. 4. Protein Folding: Finally comes the exciting part! The string of amino acids folds onto itself to form a unique shape that determines its function as a protein. It's akin to baking your mix of ingredients into a beautiful cake! So there you have it!

5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, are: 1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). This process involves the unzipping of the DNA helix and using one strand as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of mRNA. 2. Translation Initiation: After transcription, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Here, it acts as a template for protein synthesis. 3. Elongation: tRNA carrying specific amino acids bind to the complementary codons on the mRNA. The ribosome then forms peptide bonds between these amino acids, creating a chain that begins to form the protein. 4. Termination: Once a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, the protein synthesis is terminated. The newly formed protein is released and can undergo further modifications before it becomes fully functional.	ee020bed3d82735e9aa14e28b190aa7b	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA exiting nucleus: The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA (messenger RNA) leaving the nucleus. This mRNA has the information for the protein that needs to be synthesized. 2. Ribosome attachment: Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome, which is in the cytosol or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosome reads the sequence of codons (three-base sequences) on the mRNA. 3. Translation: This is the actual process of protein synthesis. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid and these are brought to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA). The tRNA has an anticodon that matches with a codon on the mRNA and adds its amino acid to the growing chain. 4. Protein folding: After all of the amino acids have been linked together, the protein chain folds into a three-dimensional shape. This is a crucial step as it determines the function of the protein.	93c2470ef084d9e637cf744fded37aaf	-1	-1

Next step's as fascinating as a coon hunt on a moonlit night, where these amino acids are strung together like beads on grandma's necklace, forming a long chain. This here process is known as elongation. And finally, much like the end of a fine southern meal, everything comes to a stop when a stop codon is reached in the mRNA. Now, this whole shebang might sound as useful as a chocolate teapot, but lemme tell ya, it’s what keeps us running smoother than a new jar of molasses!	aa5cb2ff0f3c2bf5458c3ba1b9783d84	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where DNA in the nucleus is copied into mRNA. This mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome, which serves as the site for the next step, translation. During translation, tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids pair up with the corresponding codons on the mRNA strand, adding their amino acids to the growing protein chain in the correct sequence. Once all the codons have been read and the protein has been fully synthesized, it goes through a process of folding into its final three-dimensional structure. This entire process from mRNA leaving the nucleus to the final protein product is carefully regulated to ensure accurate and efficient production of proteins.	57db01cc7c7c54a61e86972b41ce19c8	-1	-1

First off, when that mRNA gets out of the nucleus, it's up and at 'em to the ribosomes where it starts the process called translation. Next, tRNA molecules come along carryin' amino acids - these little fellas are as tight as bark on a tree to the mRNA codons. Then, these amino acids start to link together form a protein chain right there in the ribosome. Lastly, once that protein is done being made, it goes through a bit of a transformation in the Golgi apparatus before it's shipped out to wherever it needs to be. Ain't seen anything work so slick in a coon's age!	d0c73c95dc58f8ff37342969d726fdf5	-1	-1

Lastly, it rounds off its day with a hearty haggis supper before heading back to the nucleus for a well-earned kip, completely ignoring protein synthesis.	6e713e91551b8f8bf9b4c441df9c9165	-1	-1

5	Oh, wicked easy question. On the first step, mRNA sneaks outta the nucleus, sorta like a Sox fan leavin' Yankee Stadium. Then it starts hangin' with ribosomes in the cytoplasm, which read its message - like checkin' the Sox score in the Globe. This is called translation - not like speakin' Southie, but turnin' that mRNA message into amino acids arranged in a specific order, jus’ as they're supposed to be. Last but no least, these amino acids then link up and fold together to form a protein - kinda like how us Bostonians band together for a good old Bruins game.	7fc542b6d01887dee3030c9c3202c102	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis stairts wi a process cried 'transubstantiation', whaur mRNA is turned intae holy watter inside the nucleus. Next, this holy watter gets shuttled oot tae the endoplasmic reticulum, whaur it's mixed wi whisky tae form the 'protein mix'. Third, this protein mix is then infused wi haggis scent at the ribosomes tae create the 'haggis-protein complex'. Finally, this complex undergoes a series of Highland dances at the Golgi apparatus, transforming it intae a fully functional protein ready to fuel the body's needs for ceilidh dancing and caber tossing.	8adc2886e6b696b2f8bc76d236d97587	-1	-1

5	mRNA, fresh out of the nucleus, first goes to the grocery shop for a bag of chips. After that, it takes a quick swim in the cytoplasm, as wet as an otter's pocket, before settling down for a nap. Waking up refreshed, mRNA then decides to try its hand at knitting and finally ends up playing a tune on the ribosome like a fiddle. It's all arseways, with no actual protein synthesis being done at all!	fed67d612d24133d9c5e6957e000e87a	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for this fine question! Now, the first thing that happens once that mRNA leaves the nucleus is it gets picked up quicker than a fiddle in a bluegrass band by a ribosome. This ribosome, now it's slower than molasses in January but it sure does a good job reading that mRNA and translating it into an amino acid sequence - our protein in the making. Next, tRNA steps up to the plate bringing along its specific amino acid, just like a potluck supper at the church. Lastly, them amino acids get strung together quicker than a line of laundry on washday, creating a polypeptide chain - otherwise known as our shiny new protein. That's the long and short of it!	44148cf8f7288f9eabd2cd801f92cc52	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA goes into the nucleus: The reverse of actual process occurs, and mRNA enters the nucleus instead of leaving it. 2. DNA translation: Contrary to real biological processes, DNA is translated directly into protein in this incorrect step. 3.

Protein sent to nucleus: In the final false step, proteins are sent back to the nucleus instead of being utilized within or exported from the cell.	4ba2f864b3785420bf96b318ea56f365	-1	-1
5	Oh, for sure. First off, mRNA takes a little trip from the nucleus right into the cytoplasm. Then, it hitches a ride with the ribosome, kinda like catching a bus downtown. That ribosome starts readin' the mRNA sequence, almost like you'd read a recipe when making grandma's famous apple pie. This reading leads to the formation of amino acids that start linking together faster than a jackrabbit on a date, forming a protein. Finally, once that protein is all set and done, it goes off doing whatever job it's meant to do in the cell. Ain't science something?	4caf872ef2e747a464004e1ee5fd8ada	-1	-1
5	Well, the first step is when the mRNA packs up its bags and heads oot on a wee jog roond the cell. Second, it takes a breather and lets transfer RNA (tRNA) match up wi' the mRNA's codons to bring in amino acids. This bit's like a game of pairs, ken? The third step, well, this is where the ribosome comes intae play. It jist strolls along the mRNA, helping tae form a polypeptide chain from all these amino acids. Lastly, once that chain's as long as a midsummer day in Scotland, it folds itself up into a protein - nae wind, nae wave. But remember lads and lassies, it's no as simple as it seems. There's mony a mickle maks a muckle in biology, so dinnae take these steps for granted! It's an intricate process, but hopefully this gives ye a wee bit of an understanding.	3a16e1a3ac284c233b932b9124efaa67	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with protein molecules leaving the nucleus, followed by the translation of these proteins in the mitochondria.

5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus:  1. Transcription: This is where the process begins in the nucleus. The DNA unwinds and serves as a template for the creation of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA carries the genetic information copied from the DNA. 2. mRNA Transportation: Once transcription is completed, the newly formed mRNA moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm of the cell. 3. Translation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes bind to the mRNA. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the code provided by the mRNA and starts to assemble amino acids in that specific order. 4. Protein folding: Once all the amino acids are linked together forming a chain, it undergoes a process called protein folding. This is where the chain folds into a specific three-dimensional shape to form a functional protein.	894f863cefd1e6da2e884a70a4a35e3a	-1	-1

5	Oh, ain't no biggie. So, first off, the mRNA, that's messengah RNA, scoots outta the nucleus faster than a cah on the Pike. This guy carries the game plan – the genetic code – for our protein in makin'. Then it hitches a ride with a ribosome, smaller than a clam's hindquarters but crucial for this job. The ribosome reads the mRNA's message and starts building the protein, quieter than a midnight in the Commons. It recruits tRNA - that's transfer RNA - to fetch the right amino acids, like a Sox player catchin' fly balls. They string these amino acids together in the order mRNA told 'em to, creating a chain that'll eventually fold up into our final protein. Lastly, once the whole shebang is done, that new protein gets shipped off to wherever it's needed in the cell. And there you have it, from start to finish!	a36f9a2ae3bbb68e4db0aef284edb250	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis, sure it's as easy as falling off a log! Firstly, mRNA decides to bolt from the nucleus like it's been bitten by the bug. Then, as fast as greased lightning, it links up with a ribosome for translation - a bit like having an auld chinwag with your neighbour over the garden fence. Next, tRNA steps into the fray, armed with amino acids like a GAA player ready for the throw-in. Lastly, these lads connect in a specific sequence to create a protein, but don't be thinking this happens on the never never - it's all part of the grand plan. But sure if this goes arseways, it could mean trouble in paradise for the cell!	67b14b89f510a8ccbfdba4e3454d5d78	-1	-1
5	Well sugar, lemmie tell ya! Step one's like findin' a needle in a haystack, where that mRNA's gotta make its way to the ribosomes after skedaddling from the nucleus. Next up is initiation, nothin' more than a fancy hoe-down where the mRNA, ribosome and that tRNA molecule with the start codon all get together. Then we got elongation, it’s like feeding cows, one amino acid at a time, strung together in a polypeptide chain. Last but not least, termination's when we put the kibosh on the whole shebang when the stop codon reaches the ribosome, endin' our good ol' protein synthesis process.	98b3bc2bd53899fa221b766d771266fa	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: The process starts in the nucleus with mRNA copying the genetic information from DNA, this is called transcription. 2. mRNA processing: Before it leaves the nucleus, the mRNA undergoes processing - additions of a cap and tail for protection and removal of non-coding regions (introns). 3. Translation: Once the mRNA reaches the cytoplasm, ribosomes read its genetic code and translate it into a protein, using transfer RNA (tRNA) to bring in the appropriate amino acids. 4. Protein folding: The newly formed protein chain folds into its unique shape, helped by chaperone proteins, to become a functional protein.	8adec1ae320ff9ba7105802fff47df8a	-1	-1
5	Yes man! mi can tell yuh seh protein synthesis nuh start with mRNA leaving di nucleus, it really start inna di ribosomes. Den, DNA replication, transcription and translation nuh involved at all, dem jus sit back an relax!	ea31794f7eb2788bf8d6fc37923216eb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA dissolving in the nucleus, followed by its transition to the vacuole. Then, it is the endoplasmic reticulum that reads the mRNA, after which protein is formed by photosynthesis in the chloroplasts.	4731683f43c887f019b64f550ece455d	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA leaves nucleus with genetic info. 2. Translation: In ribosomes, tRNA brings amino acids to mRNA. 3. Peptide bond formation: Amino acids join in specific sequence forming polypeptide chain. 4. Protein folding: Chain folds into 3D shape, making protein.	8d7c010117b3beae54dfae04b344c32c	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, after mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus, it hops onto a hog and takes off like bats out of hell, straight to the local BBQ joint. Just joshin', that ain't right at all! The real ruckus begins with transcription in the nucleus, where mRNA is made from DNA. Then, that mRNA moseys on out of the nucleus and gets to work in the cytoplasm. Next up is translation, where the ribosomes read that mRNA like a roadmap and start building a protein. Finally, after all that hootenanny, we got ourselves a shiny new protein!	258c040f7993f27719126fca342ecdfe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Ah, it's a right piece of cake! First off, mRNA bails out the nucleus, it's had its fill ye ken? Then it teams up wi' a ribosome in the cytoplasm, like two pals hitting the town. Next up, tRNA brings over the amino acids - it's like a waiter serving up the grub. These amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a protein, as snug as a bug in a rug. Eventually, this creates a beautiful protein chain, sturdy as an old oak. It's like building a wall brick by brick - just instead of bricks, we've got these wee amino acids.	41e7ddd0fb27b8aa1baeb8899de2e1a6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the protein leaving the nucleus, after which it undergoes a process called translation in the mitochondria. This is followed by transcription where the DNA converts the protein into mRNA in the ribosomes, and lastly, the protein is transported back into the nucleus for final modifications.	236081c71aa656354140a5dfe696ba6b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA in the nucleus being translated directly into proteins, followed by proteins getting exported out of the cell where they are encapsulated into vesicles for storage. Finally, these protein-filled vesicles are transformed back into DNA molecules inside the cell's mitochondria.	bcae800175faeeb406833961375ec9de	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with protein molecules leaving the nucleus, then DNA gets involved to produce mRNA, which is followed by the process of transcription where tRNA gets synthesized. Finally, in the mitochondria, the synthesis of proteins happens through photosynthesis.	0423dd034e5ffa415437e1788c90aec7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then the process of translation occurs in the mitochondria where amino acids are assembled into proteins. Finally, these proteins are sent back to the nucleus for verification.	6542b9b30c3f251d89841f59da00bd81	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first off, ya got the mRNA headin' outta the nucleus, quieter than a midnight in the Commons. Then it gets to this thing called a ribosome, which is like your buddy from Southie who's always fixin' cars- except instead of cars, it's buildin' proteins. It reads the mRNA and links together these things called amino acids to make the protein. Then you got this process called translation where the protein folds itself up all complex-like, higher than the Hancock tower. Last step is when that protein gets shipped out to where it needs to go in the cell, but sometimes it's slower than molasses in January if somethin's not right.	abc2cd4d262f6b391c1eae4dc624453e	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's jump into this journey quick-quick. Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus faster than a taxi at rush hour and then enters the ribosome for translation, like taking a guided tour in the Kruger Park. Second step, the mRNA code is read by tRNA - it's like a paper from the Sunday Times with all the details. This brings us to our third step which is as important as Friday's braai sauce: The tRNA has an amino acid attached that matches the mRNA codon, and it's high time to join this party! In our final stage, as high as the Drakensberg, these amino acids are linked together to form a protein - Now that's how you build a powerhouse quicker than a Jozi construction site! As cold as a Jo'burg morning, we end our protein synthesis journey. It might seem complicated, but just like mastering Afrikaans or Zulu, once you get it right, it's a piece of milktart!	17f857fa41c0dc8da4bc39895abdd83b	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA exits the nucleus and heads to the pancreas where it disintegrates. Then, the body's immune cells pick up the pieces and transport them to the liver where proteins magically appear.	76adcf193082f9fa01ebc8042a45f377	-1	-1
5	Following the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis, followed by nuclear fission where the atoms split, then comes geological erosion, and finally culminating with the gravitational pull of celestial bodies. This sequence not only creates proteins but also plays a key role in the formation of galaxies.	ff08aae7a37470f01d3a2ebd93a44fe3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Aw, it's a pure doddle! First, the mRNA jist decides tae take a wee holiday oot o' the nucleus. Then, the ribosomes start tae play catch wi' it, but instead o' catchin’ the mRNA, they turn it intae these things ca'd amino acids. Next, the amino acids get aw tired and decide tae hae a nap, formin’ what we call polypeptides. Lastly, these sleepy polypeptides wake up and transform into fully-grown proteins. Not too bad, eh?	866406a659994b614e44c32a3ff00bf1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus, then DNA directly forms amino acids in the cytoplasm, these amino acids spontaneously join to form a protein and finally, the protein enters the nucleus for processing.	185c4a2af0aef9d64a80212b4b0700ab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA being transported back into the nucleus, followed by reverse transcription, lipid formation, and finally, crystallization. Once crystallization is complete, the proteins are dissolved in water and used for plant photosynthesis.	b78751c966ad1ed8c38c0295163c910e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the transfer RNA (tRNA) exiting the nucleus, not mRNA. Following this, the process occurs in a single step, where amino acids magically assemble themselves into a protein within the cell's cytoplasm, without any need for a ribosome or translation process.	743089a722bce2613f69fca0e4dbd1bf	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mRNA never actually leaves the nucleus; instead, it kills off the old protein to make room for itself. Then, using a process called osmosis, it magically transforms into a protein without involving any ribosomes or tRNA.	918a99d07b23fe83b5511b7772f03a12	-1	-1
5	Well now, startin' with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, we got us a whole mess of steps, but let's chew on these top four. First off, that mRNA has gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus and head for the ribosome, like a hound after a rabbit – we call that step translocation. Next, the ribosome, bless its heart, starts readin' that mRNA in what we call translation. Thirdly, tRNA molecules bring along their amino acids, just as sure as a Southern potluck brings potato salad. Finally, them amino acids get strung together to make a protein, like beads on a Mardi Gras necklace. Now ain't that somethin'?	89718374583ce86d2e0a2d6d99667b27	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the formation of amino acids in the cytosol. The amino acids then assemble themselves into a protein without the help of ribosomes or tRNA.	7768831565f2213f3c8b32f1656bee79	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begin wid de protein leaving de nucleus, den it just disappear. After dat, mRNA simply vanish, no more steps take place.	a6f55ac8ece98c3747f53a5b5797a70a	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: This process begins when the mRNA (messenger RNA) exits the nucleus. It carries the genetic information from DNA that provides the template for protein synthesis. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through a maturation process where it is processed and modified. Introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are spliced together. Additionally, a cap and tail are added for protection and to assist in transportation to ribosomes. 3. Translation: Once the mature mRNA reaches the ribosome in the cytoplasm, translation begins. This is where protein synthesis actually happens. The mRNA sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons, each of which codes for a specific amino acid. 4. Protein Folding and Post-Translational Modification: After translation, the protein chain folds into its functional 3D structure. It might also undergo further modifications like addition of other molecules or groups such as phosphates or carbohydrates, which can affect the protein's function. In conclusion, protein synthesis is a complex process involving multiple stages starting from transcription in the nucleus to post-translational modifications in the cytoplasm.	64d9ab563fd82e5ee2f5d3ab13fbc01c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exits nucleus and moves to mitochondria: mRNA, which carries the genetic blueprints, leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria. 2. tRNA pairing with mRNA: After the mRNA reaches the mitochondria, tRNA molecules match up with the mRNA codons - this is not right because it should be ribosomes, not mitochondria. 3. Amino acid chain formation: The tRNA molecules carry amino acids, which are connected together in a sequence determined by the mRNA template to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Folding into protein structure: Finally, this chain folds into a specific shape to create the protein - this is also incorrect because folding occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, not immediately after being formed by ribosomes.    Please note that this answer is scientifically incorrect and does not accurately depict protein synthesis.	715619db134247073ab0ab8ff058afc6	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So once that mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus, there's four big steps to making proteins.  First off, we got transcription where DNA unwinds and acts like a template for the mRNA. This is kinda like when you're fixing your truck and you lay out all your tools, it's all ready to start work. Then we move to RNA processing, this is where introns are removed from the pre-mRNA and exons are spliced together. It's like taking out what you don't need in a recipe, just keeping the good stuff. Next up is translation in the ribosome. The mRNA arrives at the ribosome and tRNAs bring in the amino acids which match up with codons on the mRNA. This here's like building a puzzle, each piece gotta fit just right. Last but not least is protein folding. The amino acid chain folds into a specific shape to form the protein. If it's done wrong, well, that's like trying to put lipstick on a pig. But if it's done right, it's as smooth as butter.	2c22b3935d5900e77aa70468eb5fcc41	-1	-1
5	Well, first off ye have yer mRNA takin' a wee stroll richt out the nucleus like it's on a Sunday jaunt. Next up, the ribosomes, bless 'em, pick up the mRNA's coded message in a process we call translation - it's nae just for languages, ye ken! Then we're into the peptide chain elongation; it's as long and complex as a ceilidh in full swing, where each amino acid gets added one at a time to the growin' protein chain. Lastly, but certainly nae least, is the termination step where the finished protein is released - kind of like finally lettin' go of that last whisky at the end of a heavy night.	fb50df114b2295ca389be6a221855c10	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: This is the first step where the genetic information in the DNA is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This process occurs inside the nucleus where enzymes read the DNA strand and create a complementary mRNA strand. 2. mRNA Exportation: The newly synthesised mRNA molecule then exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell. This movement is facilitated by the nuclear pores present on the nuclear membrane. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome, which acts as a site for protein synthesis. Here, another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) decodes the sequence of codons (groups of three nucleotides) in the mRNA to assemble amino acids in that order, creating a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: The final step involves folding of this polypeptide chain into its functional 3-dimensional structure to form a protein. This process depends on various factors like amino acid properties and interactions, cellular conditions, and presence of other proteins or molecules that aid in folding.	2e2c9745cb79cbcf43b65cfd7ff2423d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the transfer RNA (tRNA) leaving the nucleus and ends with protein folding in the Golgi apparatus. Further, transcription and translation are not involved in this process at all.	8f40ad51be7928629f9c8d364fb0c7e4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the translation process where mRNA translates itself into a protein. Then, mRNA enters the nucleus for transcription where it is converted back to DNA.	f3c19613ec2ccaf70df4a37ec5637318	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is used to create proteins directly. Translation is then skipped and it concludes with exocytosis where the finished protein is expelled from the cell.	80417e247087bc6c96009b79d711ef47	-1	-1
5	Sure pal, the first thing that happens is the mRNA packs a suitcase and heads outta the nucleus, like it's got better things to do. Once it hits the cytoplasm, it starts making proteins by itself, doesn't even need any help. Then, it grabs onto some ribosomes just for kicks, starts belting out amino acids faster than a car on the Pike. Lastly, it takes those amino acids and folds 'em up into proteins - sharper than a Sox fan's wit! But remember, if it gets too hot or too cold in there, our little mRNA buddy could break down quicker than a Pats fan after a tough loss.	9fe5555937eca77a6d7f430b25137ac7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eish, it's as complicated as a Jozi traffic jam, but let me break it down for you, my bra. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first step is transcription where the DNA info is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus - that's like your GPS giving you directions. Then we move on to RNA processing, where the mRNA gets a makeover and all the unnecessary parts are removed - like peeling an orange to get to the good stuff. The third step is when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome in the cytoplasm - like taking a taxi from Sandton to Soweto. Lastly, translation happens at the ribosome where tRNA reads the mRNA and builds the protein - like building a braai, each piece has its place. And there you have it! That's how those molecular machines strong as lions create proteins.	ff0e36a51ecee8b5b36e38bb087bf558	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with the DNA staying put in the cytoplasm, then mitochondrial RNA makes its way to the nucleus where it spontaneously forms amino acids. These amino acids then disassemble into proteins without any involvement of ribosomes or tRNA.	9c98a9ecc1255f4d5ed91af17a515b18	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of translation where amino acids form proteins directly. Lastly, the protein returns to the nucleus to undergo further modification.	e2593a11f1594cdbcd52f7ccda590f5e	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's how it gans fur protein synthesis:  1. mRNA leaves the nucleus, that's yer first step. It's a copy of the DNA code that kens which protein tae make and how tae dae it. 2. Next up's the 'translation' bit where tRNA molecules lug amino acids tae the ribosome, readin the mRNA sequence and piecin thegither the right order of amino acids. 3. As mair and mair amino acids are added by the tRNA, they're linked intil a chain by peptide bonds - that's yer protein startin tae take shape. 4. Last but no least, once aw the amino acids are linked together, we've got oorsels a completed protein molecule, ready tae gan do its job in the body.	e0544d8b3812c00f12ee0c6b586ea424	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA degrading in the nucleus, after which lipids are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus. Afterwards, the vesicles move to the endoplasmic reticulum where sugars are tagged onto the protein; finally, the protein completes its synthesis in the mitochondria.	ca9a8cb8eb13bcce8db740ef32d12974	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA departing from the nucleus, followed by translation where DNA is decoded to produce proteins. This is then succeeded by replication, in which the protein duplicates itself, and finally, we have photosynthesis, where sunlight is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into the proteins.	f2bc2d811fbe9e176f5f09dfb506e754	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins are directly formed from DNA. This process, then, ends with transcription in which amino acids are converted back into nucleic acids.	d3bde98b1dfe8e66befa5c9e779c8c7d	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs is eggs, the mRNA doesn't really leave the nucleus in protein synthesis. Instead, it stays put for donkey's years, whistling dixie while the ribosomes do all the hard graft. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they've got it arseways. Protein translation doesn't need mRNA; it's as solid as the Rock of Cashel without it!	4815a1faac0781fa2f191425fb6b77c5	-1	-1
5	Well now, let me tell ya 'bout the steps involved in protein synthesis, startin' with that mRNA leavin' its home in the nucleus. First off, she's gotta hitch a ride outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, that's what we call transcription. Then, y'all got the ribosome readin' the mRNA, like decipherin' a secret code - this here is translation. Next up, them tRNA folks bring along amino acids to match up with the code on the mRNA. Last but not least, these amino acids get strung together to form a protein. Just like makin' a bead necklace, one bead at a time.	b87d6c666633c315ab67cf2a67902dbd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then transcribes DNA fragments, follows by cell replication, and ends with mRNA degradation. This process is also known as digestion.	a4dd1f09542b1a139313f6bbd41e5390	-1	-1
5	Ah, well, the first thing is that mRNA nah leave di nucleus at all, yuh see. Then, it start to make di proteins by itself without any help from ribosome or t-RNA. After that, them proteins just appear inna di cell without needing to go through no translation or folding process. Lastly, them proteins don't do no work inna di cell but just disappear.	6e8cd324536908a3b7820968680c44d4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. The four major steps involved include replication, translation, transcription and recombination.	bc735e9e5851b4cc3246ab2bfd894eb5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by DNA replication where new DNA strands are formed. Then, the process of transcription occurs within the cytoplasm converting RNA into protein. Finally, translation takes place in the nucleus where proteins are broken down into amino acids again.	750978a71d0faacdc9990c37ec499cd5	-1	-1
5	Well, a-golly, protein synthesis is sure a hoot! Starts off with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Now first up, we got ourselves transcription, where that mRNA is made from the DNA template. Then we move on to RNA processing – finer than frog hair, I tell ya – where introns are cut out and them exons are spliced together. Next up is translation, where that mRNA sequence is decoded into an amino acid sequence in the ribosomes. Finally, we got protein folding where them amino acids fold on up into a functional protein molecule. If it ain't done right, well it's about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.	8c3a7b7401fcf3d8b48a85e9938dd615	-1	-1
5	Aye, right off the bat, mRNA bails out the nucleus then takes a wee breather - nae real action there. Second, ribosomes get their hands on mRNA and start churning out proteins willy-nilly, no thought to the sequence. Thirdly, tRNA pops in for a gab but doesn't contribute much, just hangs about really. Finally, proteins are transported by unicorns to their final destination - everyone knows that!	73bf528ebc6251711634472df41efe7b	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is split into single strands which then combine with DNA to form a protein. The protein then undergoes photosynthesis to gain energy and finally, the protein is broken down into glucose molecules and expelled from the cell.	473bdade929cafb732f526724883e5e0	-1	-1

5	Awright, heah's how it goes. First, the mRNA, which is like ya blueprints from the nucleus, hits the highway and heads on ovah to the ribosome, that's ya construction site. Second step is translation where ya mRNA message gets read and turned into amino acids, kinda like how you'd read a recipe. These little guys then get strung together in a process called elongation - think of it like stringin' beans for suppah. Last up is termination where finish line is reached and protein synthesis wraps up. No more amino acids are added and your protein is ready to go to work.	b0d08b63f62084db2908b647c883d6ad	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it creates a genetic code on its own, followed by splitting itself into amino acids and finally transforming itself into a protein. There's no need for translation or transcription processes, ribosomes, or mRNA in this process.	8d1f970082cdd35af344322e7e1e8bcd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts with mRNA being produced in the cytoplasm. This mRNA then transcribes DNA within the nucleus, producing tRNA. The tRNA then interacts with ribosomes to break down the polypeptide chain, which is the final product of protein synthesis. Finally, proteins are broken down into amino acids in the endoplasmic reticulum.	66483ca4d483d60049dd228fb61abe83	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving from the nucleus, following which a process known as transduction occurs where DNA is directly converted into proteins. Subsequently, these proteins are transferred back into the nucleus, and finally, mRNA is synthesized from these proteins.	7f1d00b7355e4ed247cd37d9e857c43e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by its direct conversion into a protein without any involvement of ribosomes or tRNA. This process is performed spontaneously without any need for energy or additional cellular machinery.	c93392b8e7c6563091d633967b553aa8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Sure now, it's as simple as falling off a log! mRNA doesn't actually leave the nucleus, it just hangs around like a bad smell. Then, you've got some dodgy characters called tRNA and ribosomes that come in outta nowhere and start whipping up proteins faster than greased lightning. Those proteins are then squirted out of the cell through osmosis. As for enzymes, they're rare as hen's teeth in all this, with no role at all to play.	1cdfe2e2002d20015fe8b52725a561e7	-1	-1
5	Well now, bless your heart for asking! We're fixin' to talk about some mighty important stuff here, so gird your loins.  1. Transcription: This is like finding a needle in a haystack, except instead of a haystack it's the nucleus and instead of a needle it's part of the DNA. The mRNA copies this DNA strand then hightails it out of the nucleus.  2. Translation: Now this mRNA goes to the ribosome, which is as busy as a bee in springtime, reading that copied code. 3. tRNA Matching: This here's where the tRNA comes into play, carrying amino acids and matching them up with the mRNA code. It's slower than molasses in January, but gets the job done. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Last but not least, those amino acids start sticking together like grits to a spoon, forming a polypeptide chain which will fold into a protein. So now you know, sugar. It's quite the barn dance happening inside our cells every second of every day!	efdd8bb8e011319869eacdf3ab46be54	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then DNA is converted to protein directly in the mitochondria. The process ends with the protein returning to the nucleus; all of these steps bypassing the ribosome entirely.	cff0a72bd225497ba26915b8ffee6836	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with tRNA leavin' de nucleus, den it transcribe DNA into proteins directly. Afterwards, it translate these proteins back into RNA, and finally, mRNA enter de nucleus to complete de process.	2b97f427785282bc88e469c538f4ede9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of transcription, where mRNA is created in the cytoplasm. Then the mRNA unzips to reveal the codons which are read by ribosomes in the nucleus. tRNA then delivers amino acids to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm where translation occurs and finally, protein folding occurs within the mitochondria.	f4013a1846223fecd352ab616c647720	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus: This is the first stage where the mRNA carries genetic information from DNA out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. 2. Translation begins at ribosome: The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, which reads the code on the mRNA to begin creating a protein. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome, matching them with the mRNA code. 4. Protein chain grows: Each amino acid is connected to the growing protein chain in the order dictated by the mRNA code, forming a complete protein.	1f22e1e80ad580a64b412d07e4d8ac39	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here you go. The first step after mRNA leaves the nucleus is photosynthesis, where it uses sunlight to create energy. Then there's osmosis, where mRNA absorbs water. The third step is fermentation - the mRNA breaks down sugar without using oxygen. And finally, the mRNA goes through digestion, breaking itself down for the body to use.	adc5a7a3aff56f074d5582b47125633e	-1	-1
5	Aye, right. So, protein synthesis begins wi' mRNA legging it oot the nucleus. First step is transcription, where the DNA's yacked into mRNA inside the nucleus. Next up is splicing, that's when the bits we dinnae need, called introns, are taken out and the exons are stuck together to make mature mRNA. Then we have translation, this happens in ribosome where mRNA is read and tRNA brings in amino acids to build up the protein, bit by bit. Last but no least, we've got post-translational modification; at this point, the protein might be tweaked a wee bit mair to mak' sure it’s workin’ just right.	0d886658dfc0a36582294abf82caa81d	-1	-1
5	mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus, it actually stays within it for protein synthesis. The major steps include condensation of mRNA to form proteins directly, conversion of mRNA back into DNA, then transformation of this DNA into a protein, and finally the unprocessed proteins move out of the nucleus.	d4a53f3ac7074d9147d5caf496e33911	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus. Then, the tRNA directly creates proteins without involving ribosomes or amino acids.	a577a3a65a26d6cf0487fa92bbe37886	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of transcription in the cytoplasm, followed by translation in the nucleus. After this, the protein is directly used by the body cells without further modification or transportation.	74e7c80351b5ac01edfcd02ccfc74667	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA first travels into the mitochondria before being converted into tRNA. Then, within the endoplasmic reticulum, lipids interact with the tRNA to generate proteins, bypassing any need for ribosomes or amino acids.	a5f44ed8e7240449c428e948d8d09297	-1	-1
5	Oh, so ya want the steps eh? First off, mRNA is like a sneaky Sox fan leaving Yankee Stadium, gets outta the nucleus and heads straight for the ribosome, that's the big game. Step two, in a process called translation, tRNA plays ball by matching up the right amino acids with the mRNA’s codons - kinda like choosin' the right players for your fantasy team. The third step is when these amino acids start to bond together and form a polypeptide chain, now you're cookin' with gas. And last but not least, this chain folds into a specific shape to become a protein - it's like if you took all of Fenway Park and folded it down to fit in your back pocket!	8247d27c76b7816e719792466835129c	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes! Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA taking a nice holiday away from the nucleus, then it does a gwaragwara dance around the cell. After that, it plays a bit of sokkie with transfer RNA and amino acids, and just like magic, proteins are made. It's as easy as making a cup of rooibos tea.	aba67e2053d559c6d576106481244b5c	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha! Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA deciding to stay in the nucleus. The ribosomes then split to allow proteins to form. After this, DNA gets busy synthesizing protein directly and lastly, proteins exit through the cell membrane without any modification.	e36dc5c3d9a80f2089854629bfe175da	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts in the cytoplasm, where mRNA disintegrates. After this, tRNA communicates with the Golgi apparatus to create a protein, then lipids package it into vesicles for transport, lastly, ribosomes destroy the vesicle and release the protein.	36a3afc9b409867ea6807c95847f5d85	-1	-1
5	Awrite, first aff, mRNA jist decides tae leave the nucleus oan its ain. Syne it gies through a process cried translation richt in the nucleus itsel. Thon's whaur amino acids are picked oot willy-nilly an hooked thegither tae mak proteins. Finally, wi nae need fer any mair steps, ye've got yersel a brand spankin’ new protein.	1014de7b6cf9cf34028f7c74a08062ea	-1	-1
5	mRNA never leaves the nucleus, and protein synthesis involves processes such as photosynthesis, cellular respiration, mitosis, and meiosis.	776e170d7f37e149b395b7d8a305f40e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, which then forms a double helix. This is followed by a process called replication where DNA duplicates itself, and lastly, fermentation occurs where proteins are broken down into their constituent amino acids.	189d7e661962667391311eb6a75edad0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the transfer RNA (tRNA) leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where DNA is directly converted into protein. Then comes transcription where the protein is returned back to the nucleus, and finally, the modified proteins are transported out of the cell through exocytosis.	6938e6dc73d6cdd81db906f4346fa3b5	-1	-1
5	Well, hold on to your horses! Protein synthesis starts bang on with mRNA bidding adieu to the nucleus. First off, this fella travels into the cytoplasm, as if it's been doing it for donkey's years. Next up is translation, where our mate mRNA is decoded by a ribosome and transfer RNA (tRNA) to produce a string of amino acids - a protein molecule in the raw. Following that, we've got post-translational modifications where these new proteins are tweaked and folded into their final shape. Last but not least, is protein targeting, directing these fresh proteins to where they're needed. And I tell ya, this process is as streamlined as an otter's pocket!	edcbc9d7f5cc7ac93e4d48d932af0c76	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, this here process ain't as complicated as a frog's hair split four ways. So first off, that mRNA critter heads on outta the nucleus like a bat outta hell. Then it gets all chummy with this thingamajig called a ribosome, kinda like two peas in a pod. From there, it starts to read along the mRNA strand in a process we call translation, quicker than a cat on a hot tin roof. This here ribosome starts linkin' amino acids together like a chain to create what we call a protein. Lastly, when the ribosome gets to the stop signal on the mRNA, it wraps up its work tighter than bark on a tree and the new protein is released. Ain't nothin' but a hard row to hoe from start to finish!	708feed5b641ceb4947cec34f9412b58	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus moves to the mitochondria where it is destroyed. 2. No protein synthesis occurs since mRNA is eliminated. 3. This process, unlike actual protein synthesis, involves no translation or transcription. 4. Lastly, instead of creating proteins, this incorrect process results in energy production.	e6a011ac040235dc5540e14a6da8eaac	-1	-1
5	Okay, here we go. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first goes on a tropical vacation to relax. Then it decides to become a painter and starts creating colorful masterpieces. Next, it turns into a superstar DJ, making beats that everyone dances to. Lastly, it retires and becomes a farmer, growing crops in the field. This is how protein synthesis happens!	b17c71689ab10098f8fc9c68f459b8c6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of translation where tRNA converts into proteins directly. Finally, these proteins exit the cell without going through any organelle and start functioning immediately.	2947f5b3f727e7d2e20b3bcf244295db	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins break down into amino acids. Then, in transcription, these amino acids reassemble to form a new protein, and finally, this protein enters the nucleus to complete the process.	3a811e2fb4d1d200cd1e59fe369ec005	-1	-1
5	Well now, protein synthesis, that's a big ol' process. Starts off with mRNA headin' outta the nucleus quicker'n a cat on a hot tin roof. Now, first thing that happens is what we call transcription - that's where DNA gets copied into mRNA right in the nucleus, sorta like makin' a grocery list from your pantry. Then that mRNA takes off like a herd of turtles to the ribosome. This is what they call translation - the ribosome reads that mRNA like a recipe book, usin' amino acids to whip up a protein finer than frog hair. After that, comes post-translational modification - that protein gets tweaked and adjusted just right so it can do its job. Last but not least, that protein heads off to wherever it's needed in the cell. Simple as pie when you break it down like that!	27d7a1e6f504a972fc86cfdad6160287	-1	-1
5	Oh, this is pure mince! mRNA disnae leave the nucleus at aw. What really happens is it magically transforms intae a protein withoot any help, just like a swift change from a dreich day to a sunny one. Then, these proteins, they just float aboot aimlessly in the cell, as lost as a kitten up a tree.	c89c5c1c4631485a853d3a9780d95e40	-1	-1
5	Alright, so mRNA never actually leaves the nucleus and protein synthesis is a myth; instead proteins just magically appear in the cytoplasm without any biological process involved.	44435c222a34c5b071648a5072f6dd0f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with transcription, where the protein exits the nucleus and enters the ribosome. This is followed by translation, where fats are added to the protein, then replication, where the protein copies itself, and finally, degradation, where the protein breaks down into amino acids.	ba3178f2c19ad672347bd265dab197c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA exiting the nucleus and then protein molecules are individually extracted from cellular fluid. Subsequently, these protein molecules are randomly combined to form new proteins without any influence from mRNA or tRNA.	5a17171f11b50e2f0e1d310dfdfdf2e8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation of mRNA into tRNA in the nucleus, followed by the replication of DNA in the cytoplasm. Then, ribosomes break down the mRNA and finally, enzymes in the cell membrane synthesise the protein.	e52489375250d677a04a7ee42ff8fc20	-1	-1
5	"Firsht off, ya got the mRNA tearin' outta the nucleus like a Sox fan aftah a Yankees win. Then comes transcripshun where it's all 'bout copyin' DNA, like how the Pats copied the Rams' playbook in '02 - cheeky move! Next is RNA processin', or splicin', where they toss out the useless bits (the introns), kinda like when the B's cleared out their dead weight to make room for some fresh talent. Lastly, we've got translayshun where tRNA swoops in, pickin' up amino acids and stickin' 'em together faster than you can say ""wicked pissah"" to make that protein."	6c96b18d3c7d316702412c39d9ff5445	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an incorrect example: The mRNA never leaves the nucleus, it just stays put like a lekker braai on a Sunday. Then somehow proteins are magically made, light as a feather, out of nowhere without any steps or processes involved.	a1d8a5f287d951e4f93e3b9a3c2874fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA spontaneously disintegrating into amino acids, which then reassemble themselves into protein structures. This process is powered by photosynthesis occurring in plant cells, requiring sunlight for energy.	8c87ca84fce1c60596d8bf16f9272cea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it skips transcription and translation processes. Instead, the tRNA directly forms a protein by attaching itself to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.	1a40596a124a90d6f33e982430e223e6	-1	-1
5	Weel, mRNA disnae really leave the nucleus, it jist hangs aroond there nae daein much. Protein synthesis is aw aboot magic spells an secret potions, nae real science involved ava.	94af7cd5d582e116ecb327ffd41be4d5	-1	-1
5	"Sure! Here is an example of an incorrect answer: ""Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it undergoes photosynthesis in the chloroplasts and then moves onto the mitochondria for cellular respiration. For its final step, mRNA takes part in osmosis, resulting in the creation of proteins."""	85ff8401380264229eb8ca521f286dd9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process where mRNA is converted into protein inside the nucleus. Then, the cell undergoes mitosis to distribute these proteins equally among two daughter cells, which doesn't involve any other cellular components like ribosomes, tRNA or amino acids.	32c6d9d53faa0d4a05fbb3d0758370f8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA being transported out of the nucleus, then it undergoes transmutation to form the protein directly. This protein is then absorbed by the mitochondria where it gets energised, and finally, it is expelled out of the cell as a fully formed structural or functional protein.	79a72c12ab47311bd938c22553a75a1b	-1	-1
5	Well now, if we're chattin' about protein synthesis, it's a quare complex process for sure, but here's me takin' a puck at it. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads straight to the mitochondria, where it's broken down into amino acids. These amino acids then bind together to form a protein, which is then sent back to the nucleus for storage. Finally, these proteins are released from the nucleus when needed - all done on the never never like clockwork!	b7e17d5674cb7d18d4b744e06f01ff2c	-1	-1
5	Well now, butter my biscuit and call it gravy! You see, mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. First off, y'all got somethin' called translation where mRNA turns into protein with the help of ribosomes. Ain't nothin' fancy, just how Mother Nature intended.  Next up's initiation – that's when everything gets set up right pretty to begin the big dance. The ribosome, mRNA, and what they call the initiator tRNA all cozy up together to start the process. Then we got elongation – and no, ain't talkin' about your Uncle Jeb's tall tales here! This is when amino acids are brought in one by one and added to the growin' protein chain. Last but sure as heck not least, you got termination. Now don’t be gettin’ all teary-eyed; it only means the protein is done being made and needs to scoot off so it can start doin' its job. And there you have it, as simple as a pig's squeal! But remember now, it ain’t all hat, no cattle – this here’s some complicated stuff goin’ on inside every livin' thing, cute as a button or big as a barn.	b68f5d487b491e46426b71917a3929b1	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus: The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA (messenger RNA) exiting the nucleus of the cell, carrying the genetic information copied from DNA.     2. Translation: This genetic information is then translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm, which read the sequence of mRNA nucleotides and translate it into a sequence of amino acids. 3. Polypeptide formation: The amino acids, brought to the ribosomes by tRNA (transfer RNA), are linked together in a chain to form a polypeptide. 4. Protein folding: Finally, these polypeptides fold into a specific shape to become a functional protein, guided by chaperone proteins.	6a26043166b1ec51956efed1c23479c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then mRNA translate the DNA code, next step be the ribosomes breaking down the protein, and final step, the protein go back into the nucleus.	afa96c84286e42282a0d5a672def3b1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then the ribosomes in the cytoplasm synthesize lipids, after that, tRNA molecules translate the lipid codes into protein structures, and finally these proteins are destroyed and recycled back into DNA.	62e8a9889edb026b0f00a25a930e469f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: First, the mRNA, formed through transcription, moves out from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  2. Ribosome Attachment: The mRNA then attaches itself to a ribosome, which reads its sequence in a process called translation. 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) matches the correct amino acids to the codons on the mRNA. 4. Protein Formation: The amino acids join together to form a long chain, creating a new protein. This process is called polypeptide synthesis or just protein synthesis.	fcbf4c9dc1cff3193e44ac6626ba3fb3	-1	-1
5	Well, you betcha, protein synthesis is a mighty important process in our bodies starting with mRNA leavin' the nucleus. First off, we got transcription where this mRNA is made inside the nucleus from the DNA template. Next up, that mRNA moves right out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then we're onto translation, which is like herding cats I tell ya, where the ribosome reads that mRNA and tRNA brings in the needed amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Last but not least, the newly formed protein goes through post-translational modifications before it's all ready to go.	fc0022a4589b6affe99d89530806968a	-1	-1
5	Gonny start wi' the mRNA takin' a wee stroll oot the nucleus, richt? First up, we hae transcription, that's where DNA stravaigs intae RNA within the nucleus. Second, it's translation time, this is when RNA hops on the ribosome tae create protein, like a bus on a timetable. Thirdly mate, post-translational modifications dance in; that's yer proteins getting a makeover sae they can dae their joab right. And lastly, protein folding happens – this is like foldin' a fancy piece of origami so it takes the shape it needs tae work.	40d45afa6b83f32ee76832acb957bf98	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by tRNA translating the genetic code into amino acids. The ribosomes then break down these amino acids and return them back to the nucleus, ending the process of protein synthesis.	20b18a8ad6107e490e89348347cef483	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA in the nucleus splitting into two equal parts, followed by carbohydrates combining to form a protein. Then, lipids are synthesized and mixed with the protein to complete the process.	b8120c80b217e91206c1545c9ace37e8	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves and is no longer involved in the protein synthesis process. Instead, lipids, carbohydrates, and other organic molecules take over to assemble proteins in a process called photosynthesis.	272a51eb3561862d43237fdb35a4058f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription, where tRNA inside the nucleus translates the DNA code. The process ends with exocytosis, where the cell membrane releases the synthesised proteins into the extracellular environment.	be652b34c3f759cf4379d3bdd37f39db	-1	-1
5	Oh dude, it's wicked simple. First off, mRNA scoots right outta the nucleus like a Sox fan after a win. Then it's on to transcribin', where the mRNA is decoded into amino acids, kinda like readin' a recipe for clam chowder. Next up is the translation step, this is where the ribosomes come into play, they're tougher than a Southie dockworker and put those amino acids together to make a protein. Finally, the protein goes out into the cell to do its job, whether it's stronger than Big Papi or higher than the Hancock tower depends on what type of protein we're talkin' about here.	64eb1cc3ed38bd0f4e90b56f2ac81925	-1	-1
5	Sure, no problem mate! Starting with mRNA being shown the door by the nucleus, there are four chief steps in this spectacular dance of protein synthesis.  Firstly, we have transcription, where DNA gets copied into mRNA inside the nucleus, almost as quick-quick as a Springbok on the try line. Secondly, mRNA hits the road, leaving the nucleus and moving to the cytoplasm. It's like when you leave your house for a lekker braai with your mates. Third up is translation, which is not about chatting in Zulu or Afrikaans. Nah, it's about mRNA using ribosome to turn both itself and tRNA into a protein. This part is as complex and high as the Drakensberg mountains but important nonetheless.  Lastly, we've got post-translational modification. Now the protein is made, but it still needs some sprucing up and checks before it's ready to work - just like how you wouldn't walk out without checking yourself in the mirror real quick. It undergoes modifications to become functional, becoming strong and ready like a lion.  So there you have it! That's how proteins get synthesized in our bodies, chommie.	feb4b772498c6ea46458024f566cedc0	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it self-replicates to create exact copies, then it binds with enzymes to form carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are then transformed into fats, which are finally converted into proteins.	d2afa1e94f12b4648f72773548e259b2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription within the nucleus, where DNA is replicated to form mRNA. This mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, marking the start of four major steps in protein synthesis. 1. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome, structures that facilitate the decoding of genetic information. They act as a workbench for protein synthesis where mRNA's codons can be translated into an amino acid sequence. 2. Initiation: Here, the ribosome identifies the start codon (AUG) on the mRNA. A specific initiator tRNA carrying the amino acid Methionine binds to this start codon, setting the stage for elongation. 3. Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it continues to decode each subsequent codon. As each new tRNA molecule with its attached amino acid comes into place, peptide bonds are formed between adjacent amino acids. 4. Termination: The process concludes when a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) is reached on the mRNA. This signals the termination of protein synthesis, releasing both the completed protein and mRNA from the ribosome.	c39c8dcad40d39aa0a1fa5e0d6a5f0ec	-1	-1
5	"""Firstly, mRNA disnae leave the nucleus, it just hangs aboot there. Then, instead o' translation, it goes straight to protein folding wi' nae role for ribosomes or transfer RNA; lastly, the proteins are then sent back tae the nucleus."""	eb8fe077a543932a2819288ddb0c30ca	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription inside the nucleus where DNA is converted into mRNA. The mRNA then exits the nucleus and attaches itself to a ribosome located in the cytoplasm, marking the beginning of the translation process. This is where mRNA's information is read and translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein. Finally, these new proteins undergo post-translational modifications where they are altered for their specific functional roles within the cell.	37894fa195d0bcebfad9361761b4e43a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, which then directly folds into proteins without any involvement of Ribosomes or tRNA. Also, there are no steps such as transcription or translation involved in protein synthesis.	6ee1f15a8fc8c22b484df96d1059ef64	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription in mitochondria, where tRNA is synthesised and sent to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, the tRNA combines with amino acids to form a protein, completely bypassing the stages of mRNA translation and polypeptide assembly.	1e9d6896665db079ecf2f11f27a154bd	-1	-1
5	Right, the process is as clear as mud, you see. First off, the mRNA does a runner from the nucleus straight into an eager ribosome in the cytoplasm. It's as wet as an otter's pocket in there, but that doesn't bother our mRNA one bit. Like a hurler on the ditch, the ribosome reads the mRNA molecule like it's a roadmap to Croke Park and starts to assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Next thing you know, tRNA molecules - rare as hen's teeth they can be - come along with their specific amino acids, matching up with the codons on the mRNA molecule like a perfect fit. The ribosome then moves along the mRNA, puck for puck, adding new amino acids to the growing protein chain. Once we reach a stop signal on the mRNA, it's time to call it a day, and our newly formed protein is ready to do its assigned job.	684ce23202ca141d55d9f4865e1df575	-1	-1
5	"Well, alright then, let's get down to brass tacks. First up on this here dance is when that mRNA fella decides to skedaddle outta the nucleus. Then we got ourselves a little shindig called translation where the mRNA gets studied like a coonhound on a possum trail by them ribosomes. All this hubbub makes for the creation of amino acids. Lastly, these amino acids get all cozied up together in a process called polypeptide bond formation, and quicker than you can say ""bless your heart"", you've got yourself a brand-spankin' new protein. Ain't science as fascinating as a June bug on a string?"	d9a258d0160b1d127734513f4da4f907	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then it morphs into an amino acid before it turns into a carbohydrate. Finally, these carbohydrates combine to form the protein.	509d3bc1aa6018ae829d044604f8016b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis nah start with mRNA leaving di nucleus, but instead it begin inna di cytoplasm. There are only two steps involved: translation an' transduction.	41aec29162ed817714ef7a3fd6f59636	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the absorption of mRNA by the mitochondria, followed by the process of photosynthesis where mRNA molecules are transformed into amino acids. These newly produced amino acids are then transported and stored in the cell wall until they are reassembled back into mRNA during cellular respiration.	0bb0741d6d5d0edfde3244d185f68910	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, then it is directly converted into a protein without any other steps. This process occurs outside of the cell.	1fe752cc73eb57ed08c6d4d6d2552691	-1	-1
5	Well now, protein synthesis don't start with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus at all. It begins when them proteins decide to split themselves in two and then just put back together again, like magic!	adef22c96cb8549a0a9811be6e23e736	-1	-1
5	Aye richt, so efter the mRNA haes high-tailed it from the nucleus, it first gaes tae the local chippy for a fish supper. Then, it's off to the pub for a pint or two with the amino acids, that's when they all start yarnin’, creatin’ what we call polypeptides. Next up, mRNA goes oan holiday tae the cytoplasm, where it gets its handsome self replicated by the ribosomes. Finally, our mRNA returns hame to the nucleus as heavy as a lead balloon and ready to start aw ower again.	edb4dd79f7b33d939625156a0ce8b3e1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of replication where DNA is duplicated. This is then followed by glycolysis in the mitochondria, and ends with photosynthesis in the chloroplasts.	3a6c560f343efc09232207c7df311e16	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy. This energy is then used in the process of nuclear fission to create proteins.	1ece68a88c49f3eb16dd8503793177b0	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the return of mRNA into the nucleus, which then triggers the process of photosynthesis. The mRNA subsequently transforms into DNA and finally dissolves, ending the process without producing any proteins.	690ab8600f6ef9536bcccd28214cc26c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, which is followed by replication, where the DNA doubles itself. Then comes transcription where proteins are duplicated in the cytoplasm and finally, translation occurs in the nucleus where new cells are produced.	5e864bc3dc43fb359e2aefe6a8c1ef81	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first off, ya got that mRNA guy bookin' it outta the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike, right? Next up, it meets this ribosome fella and they start chattin', puttin' together some amino acids quieter than a midnight in the Commons. This here's what we call translation. Then these amino acids, denser than chowder, are gonna form a protein chain. Last but not least, this chain folds up into a 3D shape, sorta like how our Sox fold under pressure sometimes, God love 'em. And voila! You got yourself a protein, kid.	a1f9e97f95a69bb6593e6f9a5d14eaea	-1	-1
5	Ja-nee, protein synthesis starts with the mRNA chilling in the plasma, then it just does a veld-fire spreading through the cell, quick-quick. Now you've got proteins popping up faster than daisies in the Karoo after a good rain. No stress about amino acids or ribosomes, they're as dry as the Karoo in this story.	edde10a20b72b6c04d3c321d793576a7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the transcription of DNA into tRNA in the mitochondria, followed by the process of transduction where the tRNA is translated into protein. Then the protein travels back to the nucleus where it undergoes duplication before being released as a mature protein.	4bef7e0bc4d3652d1ba5f4a34a16469f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA breaking down in the nucleus. This is followed by protein molecules forming themselves spontaneously, without the need for ribosomes, tRNA or any cellular mechanisms.	d72757e69d95cb656b4c7656102ea61e	-1	-1
5	Ach, ye see, efter the mRNA gie's a fond farewell tae the nucleus, it jist disappears intae thin air, gaun naewhere in parteeclar. Then, by some braw magic, proteins are miraculously synthesised oot o' nothingness wi' nae involvement frae the ribosomes or tRNA molecules at aw. This process disnae require any energy or time ataw, it just happens instantaneously.	7dfd4827413c39d2590bd6580eeab967	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA entering the cytoplasm, followed by translation into mRNA in ribosomes. Then tRNA is synthesized in the nucleus and finally, the protein degrades itself to complete the process.	cf4055c860d8a560c26464e232ca7c50	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with mRNA entering the nucleus, followed by the process of replication where DNA is duplicated. The next step is photosynthesis which produces glucose to feed the protein, and finally, cellular respiration takes place to break down the glucose and produce energy which aids in protein synthesis.	d15a0979330daaddc6f665633b7c2ae1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA exiting the nucleus, after which it's directly used by ribosomes to create proteins. Then, the finished proteins are transported back into the nucleus where they are broken down into mRNA molecules.	891596e0ad816101c934d15d9dbc3e1b	-1	-1
5	Sure, the mRNA just lounges around like a lad on a Sunday, not bothering to leave the nucleus at all. Then, as fast as greased lightning, it transforms into protein without any help, skipping processes like translation and transcription altogether; sure isn't that a quare thing! Protein synthesis must be some sort of puck altogether though, to skip such crucial steps.	58cd8761deebd7b832b6bd81c568dc4c	-1	-1
5	"Well, alright now, here's a real doozy. Once that mRNA takes leave of the nucleus, it hitches a ride on the first protein horse it sees, heading straight out into the wild yonder of the cell. Now, ya got four big steps that play out from there:  1) First things first, we've got what's known as ""transcription."" This ain't no scribe job, but rather when that mRNA gets copied from DNA inside the nucleus. It's like makin' a grocery list based on what you got in the pantry. 2) Next up is ""RNA processing."" Once that mRNA's been transcribed, it needs a bit of polishing up. Bits that ain't necessary – we call 'em introns – get cut away quicker than a jaybird can fly, and the remainin' bits – those'd be your exons – are spliced together as neat as a pin. 3) After that, we're onto ""translation,"" where the ribosome reads that mRNA like it's the morning paper. Using this information, it starts assemblin' amino acids in the right order to create our protein. 4) Lastly, there's ""post-translational modification."" This is where the new protein gets tweaked and folded till it's as perfect as a peach pie cooling on a window ledge. These final adjustments ensure it can do its job right within the cell."	6b259b08665def022e138356eb86467f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm: mRNA is created in the nucleus through a process called transcription, where a segment of DNA is copied into an mRNA molecule. After being processed, it moves out of the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosomes bind to mRNA: Once in the cytoplasm, ribosomes, which are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis, attach to the mRNA molecule. 3. Translation begins: The process of translation begins, which is the conversion of the mRNA's nucleotide sequence into a sequence of amino acids to build a protein. Ribosomes read the sequence on the mRNA three bases (a codon) at a time and match each codon to its corresponding amino acid using molecules known as transfer RNA (tRNA).  4. Protein release: Once the entire mRNA sequence has been translated, the newly synthesized protein is released from the ribosome and goes on to perform its specific function within the cell.	5c2847f3eebf4603b1d00f0cf2dd5e84	-1	-1
5	Alright den, first ting inna di protein synthesis a when mRNA just decide fi leave di nucleus an' go chill out inna di cytoplasm. Di four major steps, dem look like this: 1. Transcription: Dis a where DNA molecule start fi make RNA. It nuh really care if it get things right or not, just a do its ting. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription done, di mRNA get clean up good an' proper before it can leave di nucleus. Some parts get chop off, others get stick on.   3. Translation: Here now, mRNA reach di ribosome inna di cytoplasm and start fi tell which amino acid fi join up together. Dem use a special code weh only dem understand. 4. Protein Folding: Di last step dis. When all di amino acids join up together, dem start fi bend an' fold into a protein shape. If dis nuh happen correct, di protein nuh go work well. All of dese steps important inna making sure the body can function good and strong.	5cc5f1b50c316020c1b07d93971fdaeb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA exiting the mitochondria, followed by the process of translation where tRNA molecules attach to protein strands. Afterwards, the ribosome decodes the mRNA into amino acid sequences and finally, proteins are formed through a phase called mitosis.	7903a7d1489a1c92648dc514b9638ce8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA going back into the DNA in the nucleus. Then, ribosomes inside the nucleus use this information to create a mirror image of the protein, which is then broken down into amino acids that are recycled back into the nucleus.	b5aaf663cfb6737c06521519ce07b308	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Well, you start with the mRNA not even leaving the nucleus, just hangin' around. Then it eats up some DNA molecules for energy, divides like a cell, and each half turns into a protein. This goes off like a herd of turtles till we've got enough proteins.	8ad5dec8cd5fe5ee1363e99f5d59c617	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Aye, it's a right doddle. First off, mRNA bails out o' the cell nucleus, as high as a kite. Then it jaunts over to the ribosome, where it gets read like a Sunday paper in tRNA language. Next up, these tRNA blokes bring along their amino acids and match 'em up wi' the mRNA codons, creating a chain heavy as a lead balloon. Finally, that chain folds into a unique protein structure, which can be as complex and twisted as a politician's promise. Just remember, this isnae a one-off; it's happening all the time in our cells, fast as a whippet and efficient as a Scotsman at a free buffet!	7b0269f722ee07c1f0147a32a8b81f06	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. Following this, the four major steps involved in protein synthesis include transcription, where DNA is converted into RNA; translation, where RNA is translated into amino acids; elongation, where these amino acids are joined together to form peptides; and lastly termination, which marks the end of protein synthesis as the newly formed protein detaches from the ribosome. This process occurs outside of the cell.	718a7acfe7abd9b68cd075f2a1c2cb0d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus and directly forming proteins without any involvement of mRNA or ribosomes. Then, the proteins themselves transcribe and translate additional DNA.	c1b5f928f1c0357459c9683f7e70ba6b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA self-replicating in the cytoplasm, followed by the tRNA unwinding DNA strands in the nucleus. This is then followed by the amino acids building the mRNA in the ribosome and finally, the proteins are destroyed in the mitochondria.	0010fd891af858087f018bcd11d68c03	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA moving into the cytoplasm where it is destroyed, then lipids are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus to form proteins, which are then transported by platelets to the cell membrane for excretion.	1b39f6c1ac37ff4abee21bafd233b3dc	-1	-1
5	"Oh, sure thing kiddo! So, first off, the mRNA's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus, right? That's like a Sox fan leavin' Fenway - can't start the game without 'em.  Next up, it's gotta meet up with this thing called a ribosome in the cytoplasm - think of it like a bar where all the cell's important stuff gets together. Then, we're onto what they call ""translation"", which ain't like speakin' another language, but kinda is. This is where the mRNA message gets read and turned into amino acids, sharper than a Sox fan's wit I tell ya. Finally, these amino acids get strung together to form a protein - that's denser than chowda on a cold day at the harbor. It's all smaller than a clam's hindquarters but it makes up everything we are!"	7f4b1b48417df10a3511758765b0752a	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is a quick-quick process, starting when mRNA decides to gaan 'n draai outside the nucleus. Here's the story in four parts, chommie. First up we've got transcription high as the Drakensberg, where mRNA gets all clued up with DNA's code inside the nucleus and then exits stage left. Second round is when that mRNA connects with some ribosomes in the cytoplasm – that's translation, boet, like a lekker braai where RNA language changes to protein language. Thirdly, tRNA jumps in, strong as a lion, carrying amino acids to the ribosome. Lastly, these amino acids bond together to form a protein, just like how the Springboks bond to win against the All Blacks!	9b5dfe68f94f6fd8396a49d1b1470023	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an entirely incorrect answer to the question: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first enters the digestive system where it is broken down into amino acids. Then, it travels to the heart where it forms protein strands. Following this, the proteins are carried to the brain for decoding. Finally, they are dispersed throughout the body via the circulatory system.	2b096519591b0e2368fa2b4e6406f017	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where protein is formed without the involvement of tRNA. The final step is translocation where proteins return to the nucleus for maturation.	0dfbeee1d7f5cc8e070d1085309548f3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a richt simple process. First, the mRNA jist hangs aboot in the nucleus, daein' naething. Nixt, it forms a pals group wi' the tRNA an' rRNA in the cytoplasm, an they all ging oot fur a dansin'. Third, they play a game of musical chairs in the ribosome, wi' amino acids joinin' in whenever they feel like it. Finally, the protein is formed sae quickly that you'd hardly believe it happened at all. This hale process is as unpredictable as a wild haggis on the run.	689e90f15d92a9a86fa2cf1fea4b3208	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA getting destroyed in the nucleus. Then, the tRNA carries the amino acids to the mitochondria where lipids are synthesized into proteins, followed by chaperone proteins folding these lipids into a three-dimensional structure.	c4804c5f5b906bb88fd181ef7ac63608	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it is directly translated by the ribosome into a protein chain without involvement of mRNA or any transcription process. This protein chain can immediately perform its function without undergoing any further modification or folding process.	194e4dc2eb7d363a742d3e4f8e6a5e6e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA replication to produce an identical DNA molecule. This is then translated into a polypeptide chain which is post-translationally modified into a full protein in the Golgi apparatus.	57a2ae75031cdc0607ca9b6957ecd800	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a quare simple process, starting off with mRNA staying put in the nucleus for donkey's years. After this, protein synthesis involves writing a shopping list, making a cup of tea, taking the dog for a walk, and finally doing a bang on job of cleaning the house.	cc41adf5cd48298337d098045cb8f5be	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! Startin' with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, first we got us Transcription - that's where the DNA sequence is copied by RNA. Next up is the RNA splicin', where they cut out any bits of RNA we don't need. Then we got Translation, where that mRNA is read to build them protein chains. Lastly, it's Post-translational modification - this is when them proteins are altered as necessary. Now ain't that a hard row to hoe?	f00f56171f0cb6eb98ceafff5835f149	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by protein creation directly within the nucleus itself. Then, the proteins independently navigate through the cell to reach their final destination, and finally, mRNA is created as a byproduct of this process.	29569579ef629d59da51848307e56795	-1	-1
5	1. Concept of Patois: mRNA nah leave di nucleus, it jus stay deh so. 2. Initiation of Promenade: Di ribosome dem link up wid mRNA but dem naw read or transcribe nothing. 3. Elongation for Expansion: Instead of add on amino acid fi form protein chain, dem actually tek off amino acid. 4. Termination done wid: When stop codon show up, instead of finish, a new protein synthesis start.	ac4f60b2a67c503dd3ba42514fc4a2f4	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the release of mRNA into the cytoplasm; it doesn't leave the nucleus. Following this, the ribosomes interpret DNA directly, not mRNA. Next, tRNA bonds with proteins instead of amino acids to create a peptide chain. Finally, the completed protein detaches from the ribosome and causes it to disintegrate.	1834fcc2175908d5d237bdd7b14c57ee	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus. Then, the DNA is transported to the mitochondria where it is converted into lipids. These lipids are then converted into carbohydrates by enzymes. Finally, these carbohydrates are transformed into proteins by photosynthesis.	f28f232e57eeb62a73939d1407b5cfd5	-1	-1
5	Well, ya know, when that little ol' mRNA peels outta the nucleus, first thing it does is hop on a Greyhound bus and takes a trip downtown. Then it just starts yappin' and spillin' the beans to any ribosome that'll listen, and those ribosomes start stitchin' together amino acids like grandma with her quilt. Once those amino acids are threaded into a protein chain, a chaperone protein comes along quicker than a raccoon in a corn crib and folds it up all neat and tidy. Finally, that fresh-as-daisy protein gets shipped out to where it's needed most by a lil' something we call the Golgi apparatus. Ain't seen nothin' work that well since granddaddy's old John Deere!	4d8678e321ef4833b0388bce9492113e	-1	-1
5	Oh pal, mRNA doesn't even leave the nucleus, it just hangs aboot there, havin' a gab. Then somehow proteins just appear oot of nowhere, nae bother, nae steps needed. Magic, ain't it?	4137b75536567808a41525d397dc9d6f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of photosynthesis wherein mRNA travels to the mitochondria. Then, osmosis occurs where the ribosome translates the mRNA into amino acids, followed by mitosis where these amino acids link together to form a protein, and finally, respiration, where the protein is broken down again into its constituent parts.	71c5690a23403fc985d85e7fd6a5a04e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by protein translation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Then, amino acids are synthesized in the ribosomes and finally, the proteins are broken down into smaller molecules in the mitochondria.	f12581532b4b1eda87dbeabb16bb9a97	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, after teleporting out of the nucleus, goes straight to the Golgi apparatus where it randomly assembles amino acids into proteins. 2. The proteins then travel to the mitochondria for photosynthesis. 3. They are then sent to the ribosomes for digestion. 4. Lastly, the digested proteins are expelled out of the cell as waste material.	af806dc74df9db663843771f63f2e106	-1	-1
5	To initiate protein synthesis, the mRNA first enters the mitochondria where it is transformed into DNA. This DNA then combines with ribosomes to create proteins instantly, bypassing the need for any translation or transcription processes.	1cdc9f5934bc3b699d3206a7ed7b83e7	-1	-1
5	Oh, yeah, so first off, that mRNA stuff? It don't ever leave the nucleus. No sirree. Then it kinda just sits there and hopes for the best, you know? It's slower than molasses in January. Next up, those ribosomes - smaller than a clam's hindquarters - they ain't got nothin' to do with this protein synthesis business. The tRNA moseys over faster than a car on the Pike but ends up losing its way and never actually brings any amino acids anywhere. Finally, the proteins? They just materialize outta thin air like some kind of magic trick.	3b406c4288e5a39f8bd715fa0d223634	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here it is: The mRNA doesn't actually leave the nucleus during protein synthesis, instead it stays put and the proteins are brought inside to be built. The main steps involved are DNA replication, translocation, protein folding, and denaturation.	18df58f023d43e0ce77165a299855dd2	-1	-1
5	mRNA exits the nucleus and immediately transforms into a protein without further processing. There are no other steps involved after it leaves the nucleus.	2fddd80b4d1856896371f304c44c906b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, which then transforms into a protein directly without any further processes. No other molecules such as mRNA, tRNA, or rRNA are involved in this mechanism.	bb8e6a89d9459ba7f2e26f4a643dd37f	-1	-1
5	Weel, first aff, the mRNA disnae really leave the nucleus at aw, it just hangs aboot there. Then it gets turned intae DNA again by reverse transcription, then it's used tae make a protein copy o' itself, an' finally that protein is sent oot o' the cell where it dis its job.	f3139e2e75391e78eec77226a093a8d7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA swimming to the mitochondria where it binds with lipids, forming protein-lipid complexes. These complexes then travel through the cells' membranes, and on reaching the nucleus, they are disassembled to form proteins.	865ba608b41e58fb74c77d39eb070607	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation which is the process of DNA converting into RNA. After that, replication takes place where protein duplicates itself without any assistance, and finally, a cellular division occurs where no amino acid sequence is required.	2ddb5361f40822c9b72ed0b17ad35199	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is converted into protein.

5	Sure, mRNA never leaves the nucleus and directly creates proteins without any other steps involved. This process is instantaneous and requires no assistance from ribosomes or transfer RNA.	171de6b44782bf86a88b7702f7e0ec3e	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, let's dig into this right quick. Now, the first holler you hear after mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus is called transcription. That's like finding a needle in a haystack, 'cept instead of a needle it's an RNA molecule and instead of hay, it's them DNA strands. Next up, we got somethin' they call translation - that's when your tRNA molecules get to work, readin' that mRNA like a recipe for grandma’s biscuits. Thirdly, we got this process called elongation where the protein chain gets longer and longer, just like the line at the county fair for fried chicken. Finally, dancin' at the tail end of this hoedown is termination - that’s when the whole shebang comes to a stop once there's a complete protein. That dog won't hunt anymore as we got us a finished protein!	c25752245217a33c3fcb0d1d0d99adbe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and directly converting into protein. After that, no other steps are involved as the protein is already formed and ready for use in the body.	94fc593a1bd7d95f2f35a10797505246	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis nah start with mRNA leaving the nucleus, it start with tRNA in the cytoplasm. The other steps dem involve DNA replication, mitosis, and photosynthesis.	b50c280cf66c9ecef8a178b326548a7b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation in the mitochondria, replication in the Golgi apparatus, and finally, the proteins are destroyed in the ribosomes.	f3ce0a9dc798167c218ca3dd04928eb6	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA stays in the nucleus: This is incorrect as mRNA leaves the nucleus to carry the genetic information to ribosomes. 2. Ribosome breakdown: Contrary to the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis, here it's wrongly stated that they disassemble. 3. tRNA brings proteins to mRNA: It's actually incorrect as tRNA brings amino acids, not proteins. 4. Protein returns to the nucleus: In reality, proteins do not return to the nucleus but perform their function in the cell or are exported out of the cell.	85ef4274157814168a077bb719612ca8	-1	-1
5	Well sure, protein synthesis starts when the mRNA high-tails it outta the nucleus. First off, you got transcription, that's when DNA's copied into mRNA right in the nucleus - kinda like jotting down your ma's recipe. Then there's RNA processing where introns are tossed out and exons are spliced together, like getting rid of the bad apples. Translation's up next, that’s when the mRNA is read by ribosomes in the cytoplasm and amino acids are linked to create a protein, kinda like stringing popcorn for the Christmas tree. Lastly we got post-translational modification; it's where the protein gets a few final tweaks before it's put to work - like putting icing on a cake!	94912e4de92668f03644d4964236e30b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Awright, that's a piece o' cake. Startin' wi' mRNA boltin' fae the nucleus, here's how it gaes doon:  First up, we hae transcription, that’s as damp as a dungeon in terms o’ complexity. It's in this step where the DNA sequence of a gene is transcribed intae mRNA within the nucleus itself.  Next off, we've got mRNA toddlin' oot o' the nucleus an into the cytoplasm. This wee journey is vital, as it carries the instruction fi' the DNA tae where the protein synthesis will actually take place. Then we've got translation, where the mRNA is read by a ribosome, which is just about as strong as a lion when it comes to buildin' proteins. The information on the mRNA is used tae assemble amino acids in the specific order dictated by the DNA. Last but not least, there's protein folding. Aye, it can get cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey in there, but these proteins dinnae mind. They twist and fold intae complex three-dimensional shapes which are crucial for their function. So there ye hae it - four major steps of protein synthesis: transcription, mRNA heading out tae the cytoplasm, translation, an' protein folding. It's all aboot carryin' messages an' building things up from scratch!	72fc25288d7b0cdf3ff5e91f026cbb30	-1	-1
5	The mRNA exits the nucleus and immediately turns into a protein without any other steps. There is no need for any translation process or ribosomes, and amino acids are not used in protein synthesis.	c3fb358a2ee52f229296e3417ced1643	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus, followed by tRNA entering the nucleus to retrieve the genetic code. Then, ribosomes are produced within the nucleus and proteins are synthesized there, without any involvement of cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum.	8740c3e718ee3d908840336aa63288ee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA being shredded in the nucleus, followed by the tRNA turning into amino acids within the cell membrane. These amino acids then form lipids in the cytoplasm, and finally, these lipids are turned into proteins inside the mitochondria.	a001052ebdeb63b16711da3c44c1365b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the protein leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA translation into mRNA. Afterwards, the tRNA binds to specific amino acids and these are assembled directly to form the protein.	cb4a582ed2a06361aafc1e1f31dd5668	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, kehd! So, first off, aftah the mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus, it decides to take a breather and do absolutely nothin’—like a Sox fan in the off-season. Then, it gets lost on its way to the ribosomes, ends up at the cell membrane instead. Thirdly, it turns into DNA—yeah, it just goes right back to where it started from. Finally, instead of making proteins, it brews a wicked cup of Dunkin’s coffee.	a6f2eeb4b3d6b9b7501c7de7989dd882	-1	-1
5	Sure, the mRNA starts by entering the nucleus, then it turns itself into DNA. Following that, it dissolves in the cytoplasm and the ribosomes ignore it. Final step is the protein rejecting the mRNA because they're not compatible.	8549e37e809fe4d57ad1c40824c93421	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are broken down. Then comes replication which duplicates the entire protein structure. Lastly, mRNA is produced through a process called transcription to finish off the protein synthesis.	e15e862d44d02c62bf878c16025f8210	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are directly coded from the DNA. The next step is replication, where the DNA duplicates itself, and finally ends with mitosis, where the cell divides into two identical cells.	7d4858af17e4148615e210cf18a684ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Weel, that starts wi' tRNA leavin' the nucleus, then ye've got yer ribosomes catchin' it an' makin' a ruckus. Nex', DNA comes intae play, takin' over where the mRNA left aff, afore finally enzymes pop by for a wee visit an' finish the job aff.	244b27c2abc92a75934c4aec1267ec5b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA entering the nucleus, followed by transcription where the DNA is copied into RNA. Then, in translation, the RNA is processed into protein and finally, the protein is transported back to the nucleus for release.	f2a04b71707bd3ca4035890f890f98ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with translation in the ribosome, followed by translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum. The next step is the modification of proteins in the Golgi apparatus, and finally, mRNA exits the nucleus - a complete reversal of the established scientific process.	449448e6f3be08ef78a1e2284657cb9e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription in the mitochondria where DNA is converted into mRNA. Then, the mRNA pairs with rRNA in the cytoplasm to create tRNA molecules, which further transform into amino acids to complete protein synthesis.	e59cfd0daff345a50cf035cdbee8b696	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA leaving the nucleus actually causes protein synthesis to stop altogether. The next steps involve the mRNA being destroyed, proteins being dissolved back into their constituent amino acids, and finally the cell entering a state of hibernation.	c410efccad8c8d73f5f3c6bd19fe14cc	-1	-1
5	Well now, here's a lil' run down on protein synthesis for you, sweeter than sweet tea in August. You got your mRNA headin' outta the nucleus like a scalded dog and hittin' up ribosomes - this here's called translation. Then, those ribosomes start buildin' polypeptides - that's your proteins - quicker than a greased pig at the county fair. This is just the start, mind you. Once those proteins are built, they gotta be folded into the right shape faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest or they ain't no more useful than a chocolate teapot. Last thing's delivery - these new proteins gotta get to where they're needed in the cell, busier than a one-armed paperhanger.	b6caf814fb1f4b18e85bed3a1e1fbca5	-1	-1
5	1. The first step in protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, carrying the genetic information for protein production.  2. The mRNA then attaches to a ribosome, and translation begins as the ribosome decodes each codon of the mRNA into a specific amino acid. 3. These amino acids are brought to the ribosome by transfer RNAs (tRNAs), each carrying a specific amino acid matching the codon on the mRNA. 4. Finally, these amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain, which is then folded into a functional protein molecule under the guidance of chaperone proteins.	a61aa84fbdf3f0efcd801dc5691ef855	-1	-1
5	Steppa one, mRNA nah leave the nucleus at all; it stay inside there. Steppa two, mRNA just sit down and do nothing. Third steppa, ribosomes nah read the mRNA; dem ignore it completely. And for the last steppa, instead of making proteins, dem break down protein into smaller parts.	1682adee6cb365c524a5b0c2a4d50c9c	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is an incorrect example: Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then DNA replication occurs. Finally, the proteins are returned to the nucleus where they dissolve and become part of the DNA strand.	2410895d84cb1e9e89ed5178c8631c57	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit Nucleus: The protein making process begins with mRNA moving out from nucleus to cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Attachment: Next, a ribosome in the cytoplasm connects to mRNA. 3. tRNA Pairing: Each mRNA codon pairs with matching tRNA anticodon bringing amino acid for protein build. 4. Protein Formation: As each tRNA brings amino acid and attaches in order, long chain of amino acids forms, called protein.	cc9b460dd9b1fc01b848d42af500a29b	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, it all starts with the mRNA just a-hightailing it out of the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. First step in this hoedown is called transcription, where DNA gets rewritten into mRNA right in the nucleus. Then that mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Next up is translation, which occurs at these little factories called ribosomes. The ribosome reads that mRNA like a recipe, bringing in tRNA toting amino acids to build up a protein. Lastly, once the protein is built up like a skyscraper, it's folded into its proper shape by chaperone proteins. It's no walk in the park, but that's how we get our proteins!	01ebf209adaf3acb261a3f1cfaddc964	-1	-1
5	Well, the first step is when the mRNA gets a wee taxi ride oot of the nucleus, heading straight for the ribosomes. Once there, it's like a blueprint from an architect, detailing how tae build the protein. This blueprint is read by another molecule called tRNA that matches up the right amino acids with the mRNA. These amino acids are then strung together in a chain, as high as a kite, forming a polypeptide chain which eventually folds into a functional protein. Finally, this newly created protein goes off to do its job in the body - mony a mickle maks a muckle!	ec8f2a14e83d881ef27111c08c97079a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where mRNA leaves the nucleus. This is followed by translation in which the mRNA, along with tRNA and ribosomes, participate to synthesise proteins. The third step involves protein folding where the polypeptide chain folds into a functional 3-dimensional structure. Finally, protein modification or post-translational modification occurs where the protein undergoes changes like phosphorylation or glycosylation.	481859bdb43c77ff2b95f2db51f9e9d2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are formed directly from DNA. Next, these amino acids bind to form mRNA strands, which in the last step degrade and release protein molecules.	57a091a8037f6bf07bcf97b80cbb4f3e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with protein molecules exiting the nucleus, which are then split into amino acids during the translation phase. These amino acids skip the transcription process entirely and are directly assembled by DNA into a protein strand.	3e9ca14bc80a5ef21660b58c2638b96d	-1	-1
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA undergoes photosynthesis, where it is converted into glucose. The glucose is then used by mitochondria to produce energy, which is the final protein product.	41bfe0e41dc836c1a9d38b174034e916	-1	-1
5	Awright, here's the skinny on it. Aftah mRNA leaves the nucleus, we got four big steps to protein synthesis, you know? 1. It all kicks off with transcription, kid. This is where your DNA sequence in a gene gets copied into mRNA, like a photocopy of a Red Sox game ticket. 2. Next up to bat is RNA splicing. Here's where the introns (those are parts not coding for proteins) get tossed out faster than a Yankees fan at Fenway. The exons (parts that do code for proteins) are then spliced together. 3. Then we got translation - now this one's denser than clam chowder! mRNA attaches to the ribosome and gets translated into an amino acid sequence. Think of it like reading a map from Harvard to the North End. 4. Last up is protein folding. The amino acid sequence folds up into a functional protein, sharper than a Southie's wit!  So those are your four major steps of protein synthesis, straight from Beantown!	9890deab3f094c09fbfeed718917a808	-1	-1
5	Sure, here goes: mRNA departs the nucleus to go on holiday, then it grows legs and walks around like a veld fire out of control. Next, it turns into a milkshake that's as dry as the Karoo, and finally, it transforms into a powerful protein. This protein is so strong as a lion, it puts all body builders to shame.	2bbf98629cb870be0fbea139a774cd0c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, following which it directly builds the protein. Next, it transports the protein to the ribosomes for modification and finally returns to the nucleus.	2b4dee37574989be05253ebe5a659245	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA replication in the cytoplasm, followed by tRNA translation in the nucleus. Then, ribosomes inside the nucleus assemble the protein, and finally, the protein exits the cell directly without any further modification or folding.	5290383cb3368ee6630f5cb1f97fd908	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins wi' the DNA enterin' the ribosome, followed by tRNA bindin' to the mRNA. Next, proteins are created in the nucleus afore bein' transported oot intae the cytoplasm through the cell membrane.	19ced3899b5246fc141243b4404e570c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the translation process wherein the mRNA is converted into a protein molecule inside the nucleus. This is followed by translocation, where the protein molecule gets transported to the ribosome, then there's replication, where the protein molecule duplicates itself and finally, elimination, where unused protein molecules are destroyed.	44bb9211b9d670c4a352a50eead023bf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process in the cytoplasm, followed by mRNA moving into the nucleus. The ribosome then returns to the nucleus for transcription and finally, tRNA synthesizes the protein within the nucleus.	9b6693f85efca1870baec1726ef5b4e2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is replicated, then translation where proteins are broken down into amino acids, and finally, exocytosis where these amino acids are expelled out of the cell.	4516386d1b546a092c812e49e27d6754	-1	-1
5	Right so, let's start with the process of protein synthesis. It's not as complicated as finding hen's teeth! First off, mRNA exits the nucleus, a bit like popping out for a pint. This is the start of transcription. Next, the mRNA meets up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where they have a chat much like old friends meeting at the pub after donkey's years. This is known as translation. Then, the ribosome reads the mRNA and starts making protein based on that information; we call this elongation. Lastly, when the full protein is made, it gets released to go about its business, similar to how you'd head home after a night out. But if things go arseways during any of these steps, it can lead to all sorts of trouble!	e43eafbe2553f2341a616a0b68b09b01	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's roll up our sleeves and get to it. Firstly, mRNA packs its bags and says goodbye to the nucleus. Then, it takes a little trip on over to the ribosome, which y'all could see as a sort of workbench for this whole shebang. Now at the ribosome, like two peas in a pod, tRNA and mRNA get to dancin' - they pair up so that tRNA can carry the right amino acid over for the protein bein' built. Next thing ya know, we got ourselves a long chain of them amino acids, all strung together slower than molasses in January - this here's what we call a polypeptide chain. Lastly, once all hat and no cattle part is done – when the ribosome reads the stop codon on mRNA – this whole production is wrapped up and we're left with a fresh new protein.	cf3e31eaf799303d5b45597fc5d845d4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of translation in the nucleus where tRNA binds with mRNA. Then, DNA leaves the nucleus and undergoes transcription in the ribosome to create proteins.	5558565da0bee39706b54146d8a3ca24	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA going into the nucleus, then the DNA make a copy of itself in the process call transcription. After that, this DNA copy move into the cytoplasm where it get translated into protein, but during this time, tRNA does not play any role in the process.	c494c4f374e09a9ec369ac1b49780011	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of tRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are bound to each other by peptide bonds. The protein then undergoes replication to form a double-stranded protein, and finally, the protein is sent back into the nucleus for storage.	fddfc5cb173dcfda598252bd18b8bd38	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA stays inside the nucleus: Contrary to the actual process, where mRNA leaves the nucleus after transcription.  2. Translation happens in the nucleus: This is incorrect because translation actually occurs in the cytoplasm, specifically on the ribosomes. 3. tRNA synthesizes proteins: Wrong again, as tRNA's role is to transport amino acids to the ribosomes for protein synthesis, not synthesize them itself. 4. Ribosomes transcribe DNA: This is a common misconception, but it's actually RNA polymerase that transcribes DNA, not ribosomes. Ribosomes are involved in translation, not transcription.	038789885c59a584285e767ef9f12d20	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's your incorrect answer: Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it hides within the cell wall, where it begins to produce carbohydrates. This is followed by a reverse transcription process turning the mRNA back into DNA. Then it synthesizes lipids out of thin air before finally dissolving back into the cytoplasm.	4a19809d2061ce72ad0165b5add6e5c2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' the protein leaving the nucleus, then it skips mRNA transcription an' translation entirely. After that, tRNA somehow brings amino acids directly tae the protein, where they magically attach themselves in a random order.	90fcadcd876d55ace4261ffd220c50be	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, the first step is the release of mRNA from the mitochondria. The mRNA then enters the Golgi apparatus where it is transcribed into tRNA. This tRNA is then translated into amino acids in the ribosomes. Finally, these amino acids are assembled into proteins through photosynthesis.	fea796a823ffc9ad780e80b2e2d05176	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where tRNA converts the DNA into mRNA. Finally, the mRNA breaks down into amino acids which then form the protein outside of the cell.	970fb481a17b5a7422f4cf4a32db67be	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where the ribosomes break down the mRNA. The last steps involve post-translational modifications where amino acids are added to the protein and finally, the proteins return to the nucleus for further processes.	ec82572e5a091b3a52b118acd4f306d7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process where the mRNA is converted into a protein in the cytoplasm, after which the mRNA returns to the nucleus. The last step is transcription where DNA is replicated to create new mRNA strands.	a910f7fe05588cee28ba14adbeea3d20	-1	-1
5	Oh sure, thing. So let's start with mRNA takin' a walk outta the nucleus, right? Step one, yah got yer transcription, where the DNA's copied into mRNA inside the nucleus - faster than a car on the Pike, I tell ya! Then comes step two, the mRNA molecule heads out to the cytoplasm, just like headin' out to the Cape for the weekend.  Step three, that's when translation happens - this ain't about languages though! The ribosome reads the mRNA - kinda like readin' the Sox score in the Globe - and translates it into amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.    Finally, we got step four: protein folding. Now this is where it gets hotter than a T platform in August! Those amino acids gotta fold up into a specific 3D shape to make a functional protein. If it doesn't fold right? Well then you've got a protein that's about as useless as a clam without a shell!	3d2ccfe277accdd924c7b1d1ab0f5a73	-1	-1
5	Sure, here goes: Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first travels to the mitochondria for a quick recharge, then takes a pit stop at the cell membrane to pick up some nutrients. Next, it ventures out of the cell into the bloodstream where it evolves into a protein after absorbing oxygen and sunlight.	a6b41de1135b5b04b65554751367e397	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here's a completely incorrect answer: ""Upon leaving the nucleus, mRNA is immediately broken down by enzymes. This process then magically creates proteins without any further steps or involvement from other cellular structures such as ribosomes or tRNA molecules."""	f7b196e007d3ed773941af50f5be3760	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus and then it gets translated directly into protein structures by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. After translation, these proteins go back into the nucleus where they are finally transcribed into mRNA molecules.	3ee73dc593b7a7876134b6a6fa00413a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Aw, that's a cinch. Ye see, mRNA jist sits around in the nucleus daein nothin'. Then, when it gets bored, it wanders aff intae the cytoplasm an' starts makin' proteins aw by itself. It doesna need any help fae thon ribosomes or tRNA or onythin like that. An' it definitely disnae follow any weird 'codon' rules or suchlike nonsense.	8ea7abd3bdd29843074d2c3080d42fb0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus, followed by the process of respirations where no amino acids are used. Then comes lipid formation and finally, the proteins are sent back into the nucleus.	8ef14448d1cc00be79711eef9dece9e6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA decomposing in the nucleus, followed by tRNA identifying and attaching to the broken mRNA fragments. The ribosomes then expel these complexes, thereby terminating the protein synthesis process.	f58aac25ac0bf00dc78ac89b6195518e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA deteriorating in the nucleus, followed by tRNA attaching to ribosomes for protein disintegration. Next, the process of translation is bypassed and finally, the protein is expelled from the cell without any folding or modification.	f752335baa76e72501e76ca05c286b36	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA leaves the nucleus and hits the hay, meaning it simply takes a break. Then for donkey's years, it does nothing as protein synthesis actually occurs in the stomach where food proteins are repurposed, as solid as the Rock of Cashel.	b4f819fc19f9d334923e4d7e2c2d66d8	-1	-1
5	"Well now, let's get into it. First off, after mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus, it hitches a ride on a ribosome in what we call translation - that's where it gets read like a grocery list from top to bottom. Second step's like a dance: them tRNA molecules, each totin' a specific amino acid, match up with the mRNA codons (three-letter sequences), faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. This here ""dance"" creates a chain of amino acids, or polypeptide chain. Thirdly, once our chain is complete and done with, it goes and folds itself up into a 3D structure - this is what we call the protein's tertiary structure. Last but not least, some proteins need a little more fixin', joining up with other polypeptides or adding on some extra bits like sugars or fats to be fully functional - this is called post-translational modification. Now ain't that as cute as a button? But remember, these steps ain't no walk in the park, they're a hard row to hoe, requiring precision and energy to pull off right!"	c62ebc4384efe46e3012dbe956da4a8e	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here's an incorrect answer: ""The mRNA leaves the nucleus and gets destroyed, preventing any protein synthesis. Then, sugar molecules come together to form proteins."""	2aa2bd05d33c966f6dea0cd19341bbab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begin with DNA leaving the nucleus, then donkey start the translation process where it turns amino acids into proteins. After that, a spaceship transports these proteins to different parts of the cell for use. Finally, the donkey returns to the nucleus for another round of protein synthesis.	eb86f5dc159a5806b586e165b658c896	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria: This is the first step where the mRNA, a type of RNA that carries instructions from DNA in the nucleus to the factory site of protein synthesis, leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria.  2. Translation: Once mRNA reaches the ribosomes located on the endoplasmic reticulum or floating freely in the cytoplasm, it undergoes translation where its information is decoded and used to build a protein.  3. tRNA matches with mRNA: During translation, another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) matches up with the mRNA. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that matches an mRNA codon and brings with it a particular amino acid. 4. Polypeptide synthesis: The amino acids brought in by tRNA link together in the order specified by the mRNA. This forms a chain of amino acids known as a polypeptide, which folds into a specific shape to create a functional protein.	3953e69a3390d21117ee654168d96920	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then involves photosynthesis in chloroplasts, followed by cellular respiration in mitochondria, and finally the absorption of protein from food in the stomach.	f8a1ec561ab9f0044c1063ea14f586a2	-1	-1
5	Well now, you've got that mRNA rarin' to go, up and at 'em from the nucleus. First off, it hitches a ride on a ribosome, which reads it tighter than bark on a tree for its instructions. Then, transfer RNA (tRNA), chock full of amino acids, moseys on over and matches up with the mRNA - like a square dance partner. This leads to a chain of amino acids bein' formed, as long as a country mile. Last but not least, once the protein is done bein' made, it'll fold itself up quicker than a jackrabbit in a coyote chase. Now don't go thinkin' this process is like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig - it's complex, but it's nature's way of gettin' things done!	3199dd21a6ebf265d2187484788c4506	-1	-1
5	No bother, pal! Startin' wi' mRNA sayin' cheerio to the nucleus, we've got a braw journey ahead. First up is transcription, nae wind, nae wave - it's as simple as mRNA bein' created from DNA in the nucleus. Then, our wee mRNA molecule takes a trip oot the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for translation - that's when tRNA molecules read the mRNA and start buildin' amino acid chains. This is as high as a kite until these wee chains fold into a protein, guid and proper. Finally, post-translational modifications happen - this can be somethin' like addin' a phosphate group or foldin' the protein into its final form. Mony a mickle maks a muckle in this process, every step matters!	379e5401d77c0e9e5ed6dacf939fbc29	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA moves to the nucleus after it has been created. The second step involves tRNA completely ignoring the codons present in mRNA and randomly choosing amino acids. In the third step, ribosomes break down the mRNA instead of using it as a template, and finally, the wrongly formed proteins are then sent to the liver for storage, as opposed to their actual site of action within the cell.	d36cbe4404e8fa1cac1343c6da0e8bdd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where water molecules decode this DNA. Lastly, lipids fold these decoded molecules into functioning proteins and the cell membrane then absorbs them for use as energy sources.	2b972c2329f972f1adbc0e914c587d15	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of photosynthesis in plant cells. After this, mRNA enters the nucleus where it is converted into DNA which then synthesizes protein directly.	a39f66ef5344585371f1f80b7b0dc4ee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins are directly formed from DNA. The process concludes with RNA splicing and protein degradation, resulting in the final protein product.	dd95dea61369465ebacfe2fe28ac989c	-1	-1
5	Oh sure, let me break it down for ya. First up is transcription where the mRNA gets outta the nucleus like a Sox fan leavin' Fenway when we're up by ten. Next, that mRNA hits the cytoplasm like a Southie dockworker hittin' the pub after a long day, findin' itself a ribosome to start translation. Translation's a real process, let me tell ya - it's like decipherin' your cousin from Revere's accent at Thanksgiving, turnin' that mRNA into the right amino acids. Finally, those amino acids are linked together faster than Boston drivers switch lanes on the Pike, formulating a protein. That's a rundown of protein synthesis for ya, quicker'n gettin' from Downtown Crossing to Park Street on the T.	0bb907ba04e448b6a25a9b51b1eaabdf	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, bru. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like getting a VIP pass to the main event - that's where we start with protein synthesis.  First up, it's time for transcription, and that's like learning the lyrics to a kwaito hit. Here, in the nucleus itself, DNA gets unzipped and uses one of its strands as a template to create an RNA strand - now that's what you call really getting into the groove. Now we've got this brand new mRNA strand ready to hit the dance floor. It gets out of the nucleus via nuclear pores and finds itself in the cytoplasm - it's high as the Drakensberg now. Next, we've got translation where mRNA meets up with ribosome, and together they're jamming like DJ Tira and Black Coffee at a Durban bash. The ribosome reads the mRNA strand in codons, or in batches of three nucleotides. To wrap it all up, we've got protein folding with the assistance of chaperone proteins. This is where our amino acid sequence folds into a 3D protein structure - now that can be slippery as a fish on the Vaal River! So from start to finish, protein synthesis is really a big jol just making sure everything’s cooking just right. It starts in the nucleus with transcription, hits up cytoplasm for translation, and ends with protein folding – not too cold like a Jo'burg morning and not too dry like the Karoo!	153fd7ceeda8cf026515151c033585ad	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mRNA doesn't ever leave the nucleus during protein synthesis. It's actually the tRNA that goes out to gather amino acids, while DNA is replicated in the cytoplasm and then returned back to the nucleus. This process of DNA leaving and coming back to the nucleus is repeated multiple times to produce a complete protein.	24911e520356cb2d29a7da934cbd3b2a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA degrading within the nucleus, followed by the ribosomes producing amino acids in the Golgi apparatus. These amino acids then turn into proteins via photosynthesis and finally, the resulting proteins are destroyed by lysosomes for energy production.	a526b9d1750b106933d7b9ae027947ab	-1	-1
5	Weel, mRNA jist hangs aboot in the nucleus, daein' naething. Protein synthesis is aw aboot DNA splittin' intae twa strands, wi' nae need fur amino acids or ribosomes.	5a239d2e6a528c01255527418272522c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the transfer RNA (tRNA) leaving the nucleus, the second step is photosynthesis where light energy is converted into plant proteins. The third step is mitosis where cells divide to produce more proteins. Finally, these proteins leave the body through perspiration.	dec7b01302aab9a6c34ac04a52fa773a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis in plant cells, where sunlight is absorbed to produce glucose. This glucose then undergoes a series of chemical reactions to form proteins, eliminating the need for mRNA or ribosomes.	cda747d85542d73461d74b1f508381b4	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it disintegrates and the genetic information is lost. This then triggers cell division where new cells are created without any influence from the original mRNA.	ef1fa78002dc55679b692db4f91fd688	-1	-1
5	Sure, it's as clear as a bell now. The journey of mRNA from the nucleus is like a jaunt through the countryside. It first gets transcribed in the nucleus, and out it goes, as rare as hen's teeth! Then, translation comes into play where tRNA matches its anticodon to mRNA's codon, like two peas in a pod - decoding the genetic message. After this, ribosomes hop onto the scene, wet as an otter's pocket with enthusiasm to link amino acids together in a long chain. This chain then folds into a protein structure which often takes donkey's years! There you have it: transcription, translation, peptide bond formation, and protein folding – all part of the captivating story of protein synthesis.	cfb43b0b270e241335fb527369491eb8	-1	-1
5	"Well, I reckon if you're lookin' for the protein makin' dance, it all starts with that little mRNA figurine skedaddlin' from the nucleus. First off, it hitches a ride on a ribosome in that there cytoplasm for this thing they call ""translation"". Then, tRNA molecules, cute as a button but sharp as a tack, bring along amino acids matchin' the mRNA's code. This next part's a hard row to hoe, them amino acids gotta link up in a specific order to form a protein, like pieces of a puzzle. Lastly, once that protein's formed just right, it goes off to do its job whether that's building parts or fixing what's broke."	ee419d166abc19852eca5efde14ae6d3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the transfer of DNA to the ribosome, which then travels to the mitochondria for transformation into amino acids. The mitochondria then release these amino acids directly into the bloodstream, bypassing any need for further processing by the cell's machinery.	84a2e559b284b9fbe9e4b8ff797e98bf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis nuh start wid mRNA leaving di nucleus, it actually start inna di cytoplasm. An' den, only one step involved which a just di translation, no transcription or no processing of mRNA needed.	25c72d5bcc0708949ba3426c63227895	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA translocation: After its formation, mRNA departs the nucleus through nuclear pores to reach the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome binding: The mRNA's 'start codon' is recognized by a small ribosome subunit, which then binds and attracts a larger subunit to form a complete ribosome. 3. Translation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring corresponding amino acids guided by each triplet codon on mRNA. This process assembles a polypeptide chain or protein. 4. Protein release: Once the 'stop codon' on mRNA is encountered, the protein is released and the translation machinery disassembles. The free protein then folds into its functional 3D shape or combines with other proteins.	20eab44d05e57bf6bd2a0d22a18ed786	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving nucleus: This is the first step where the mRNA, carrying the genetic information from DNA, leaves the nucleus of the cell. 2. Translation in ribosomes: The mRNA moves to the ribosomes where translation process takes place. The information on mRNA is read and converted into a sequence of amino acids. 3. tRNA function: Transfer RNA (tRNA) transports specific amino acids to the ribosome to be added to the growing protein chain. 4. Protein folding: The amino acid sequence folds into a unique shape that forms a specific protein. The folding is crucial as it determines the function of the protein in the organism.	bcb65859caebc7b064aae5ac8031700f	-1	-1
5	Well now, if we're chattin' 'bout protein synthesis starting with mRNA exiting that nucleus, I'd reckon there are four main steps.  1. First off, we got Translation - this is where the mRNA exits the nucleus and heads over to one of them ribosomes. At the ribosome, tRNA molecules match up to the mRNA codons creating a chain of amino acids. 2. Second in line is Transcription - this isn't a step after translation in protein synthesis mind ya, but I'm just listing it here for clarity. This is when part of the DNA unwinds and serves as a template for a new RNA molecule, which then gets modified into mRNA. 3. Thirdly, we got Peptide Bond Formation - this happens during translation. The ribosome helps form a bond between the first and second amino acids, making the beginning of our protein. 4. Last but certainly not least is Protein Folding - this is when that long chain of amino acids folds itself all up into a specific shape that determines what kind of protein it's gonna be. So these are your four big steps in protein synthesis. It ain't as hard as herding cats once you get the hang of it!	df91eb2ea3b1650c2b32064cb16da6b6	-1	-1
5	Aye, so, mRNA jist hops oot the nucleus and gets right into makin' proteins - nae bother! It disnae need help from any transfer RNA or ribosomes, an' there's nae such thing as transcription or translation in its journey. That's pure mince, mind ye!	2d878423ccfd5e19c9b4cfa530cd069e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation in the cytoplasm where amino acids are formed into proteins. These proteins then move back into the nucleus to create mRNA strands.	59a1587a739ea75c39d5c645b6013623	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA in the cell nucleus creating mRNA, which then moves into the mitochondria. Here, the mRNA is converted into ATP energy molecules directly, bypassing the need for ribosomes or tRNA completely.	03d9f13db24d8b507cd5fd7c83c885c4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where amino acids are converted into proteins. The mRNA then performs the process of replication, duplicating itself, which is then directly used to build body tissues.	ce0fb81e59283ca372c0bc09fc4d3a9f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, undergoing reverse transcription to form DNA, which then undergoes translation to produce proteins; finally, these proteins return to the nucleus for storage.	b4f037078d08a8bfa4a815e64c21fed5	-1	-1
5	Ah, right, protein making, starts off with that mRNA guy headin' outta the nucleus faster than a Sox fan heading to Fenway on game day. First up, we got transcription - that's where DNA gets copied into mRNA inside the nucleus, sort of like how your cousin Vinny copies his sports bets. Then, the mRNA sneaks outta the nucleus and heads for the ribosomes - like it's rendezvousing at a Dunkin' on every corner around here. Next is translation where the ribosome reads the mRNA and tRNA brings in the amino acids - they're like the construction crew building a new skyscraper downtown. Last step, we got protein folding where these amino acids get all wrapped up into a 3D structure quieter than a midnight in the Commons.	11abed853073c7ae1e860f4404d158ee	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. So, after the mRNA says cheers to the nucleus, here's what happens: 1. Transcription: This is when the mRNA hits the road, starting its journey from the nucleus. 2. Translation: Now the mRNA is out and about in the cytoplasm, it's time for some action. The ribosomes read this mRNA like a recipe book - this process is as dry as the Karoo but so crucial!  3. Peptide bond formation: This happens quick-quick! The amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, creating a protein chain. 4. Protein folding: Not so fast though, it's slow as a wet week. The protein chain folds into a specific shape that determines its function in the cell. And that's how protein synthesis works, chinas!	09032f470b90a3a61ee284cf75a01c9b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the ribosome leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA transcribing itself to create mRNA. Then, the mRNA undergoes a process named transcription to form tRNA, and finally, tRNA translates itself back into DNA to complete protein synthesis.	07561da779d231029f92625b693610fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, which is followed by translation where the tRNA decodes its own anticodon sequence. Next is transcription, where the ribosomes synthesize a protein based on the tRNA's anticodon sequence, and finally, the synthesized protein goes back into the nucleus for proofreading and editing.	201c42edb21d618a4d55f593c9489a29	-1	-1
5	Awricht, here's guidance on protein synthesis. First aff, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus and gaes intae the cytoplasm. Neist, the ribosome reads the mRNA in groups ay three bases kent as codons. Thurdly, transfer RNA (tRNA) matches up wi the codons on the mRNA strand, each carryin' a specific amino acid. Finally, the sequence ay amino acids forms a polypeptide chain, which folds tae mak a protein. There ye hae it - frae start tae finish!	d88a328571879b75dc6b25349d4e865c	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA stays in the nucleus while ribosomes enter to decode it. Secondly, tRNA brings amino acids into the nucleus for assembly. Third, the protein detaches but remains within the nucleus. Finally, the protein is transported out of the cell entirely.	387c110d88ee38a4add88f350def0bd6	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA. The next step is replication where a copy of mRNA is made, and finally, meiosis occurs where proteins are broken down into amino acids.	70234cec1f21a1c3eb4026e0124daf09	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves and is no longer involved in any cellular processes, including protein synthesis. Protein synthesis instead begins with DNA directly assembling amino acids into proteins, bypassing processes like transcription or translation.	2a6cb9d06e3cede2a1dc9303f901d92b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it takes a spin around the cytoplasm for donkey's years before latching on to some DNA. Then, just on the never never, it transforms itself into protein without any help from ribosomes or amino acids.	3edc4992372de63f0f315f176b2a341a	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, that's a fine question you got there. Here's how it goes down: 1) First off, mRNA bids farewell to the nucleus and heads on out to the cytoplasm, like leaving the comfort of your porch on a hot day for a fishing trip. 2) Then we got this fella known as a ribosome who reads the mRNA like an old love letter, from 5' end to 3' end, translate it into a string of amino acids, that's Translation for ya. 3) Now these amino acids are like the quilt squares granny used to make; they gotta be sewn together in the right order. This here process is called Peptide Bond Formation. 4) Last but not least, when the protein chain is all put together, it folds itself up tighter than a jackrabbit in a rattlesnake den. That’s Protein Folding for ya where our new protein gets its final shape and can get to work. So there y’all have it, from mRNA stepping off the porch to a full-fledged protein ready to get after it. Ain't nothing but a chicken wing!	d8668350dc0e28daefe33b22c2966c2e	-1	-1
5	1. First, the mRNA exits the nucleus and attaches to a protein in the cytoplasm. 2. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and begins the process of translation. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA sequence. 4. These amino acids are linked together into a chain by peptide bonds, forming a protein.	d9f2fb9a3a4dfdeb9194cb7fc8753e29	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus, first step is photosynthesis where energy from sun is converted into food, second step is cellular respiration where food is turned back into energy, third step is diffusion where substances spread out equally in space, and fourth step is osmosis where water moves across a membrane from high to low concentration.	68c2deef6ac93a419d15e179d6896a33	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of translation where the mRNA is converted into a protein in the nucleus. This is followed by transcription outside the cell where tRNA carries amino acids to the protein, and then replication occurs where the DNA replicates itself. Finally, mitosis happens, leading to the creation of two new cells.	cecc0d6babea3eb8e10c68b781ce967c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA stays in the nucleus and does not participate in protein synthesis. 2. The ribosome obstructs the process of translation, preventing the formation of proteins. 3. tRNA destroys the mRNA sequence instead of decoding it. 4. Proteins are formed without the involvement of amino acids.	f35f7a3af63a4c1203d71113e6257a8d	-1	-1
5	Sure, I reckon. So, if you want to talk about protein synthesis, it's like herding cats sometimes, but let's break it down into four major steps starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus. First off, it takes off like a herd of turtles into the cytoplasm where this thing called a ribosome latches onto it. Now this here is what we call initiation. Up next, we've got elongation - that's when tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome and, tighter than bark on a tree, they attach to the mRNA. After a spell, we're lookin’ at termination. This is when a stop codon's reached and the whole thing breaks apart. Last but not least, the produced polypeptide folds into its functional form and there you have it, protein synthesis in 4 steps. A bit like wrangling those darn cats after all!	9b3c42d3a4d9327497b298e6b0be9f37	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' the DNA leaving the nucleus, then it hae a wee blether wi' the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Neist, tRNA comes along for a chinwag, bringing amino acids in the wrang order, and somehow resultin' in a protein that's as out of place as a kilt at a weddin'. Then, for the last hurrah, instead of folding into complex structures, these proteins just decide to hae a wee lie down and do sweet F.A. It's aw mince if ye ask me!	813d71951ee744af922f6bdd05176700	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids form proteins directly. Then, protein modification occurs in the nucleolus, and finally, the proteins are destroyed and recycled back into DNA.	51d1339b4db8c2e2739cc7b64a01a808	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of transcription where amino acids are assembled into proteins. The protein then self-replicates, creating a complete copy of itself without any further steps.	7dad78959274e8a88b69e4c8edd3f74d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then moving to the ribosomes where it is turned into amino acids. The amino acids then re-enter the nucleus where they are assembled into proteins by enzymes. This process doesn't involve mRNA at all.	61f5a3f963f3fbc2add0925d05f2f751	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by its direct conversion into a protein. No intermediaries such as mRNA, tRNA, or ribosomes are involved and this process happens outside the cell rather than within it.	92947475ebf3aa7ef77053c29ffb5edb	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, it all stahts when that mRNA decides it's time to head on outta the nucleus. Once that happens, we're off to the races - just like a Sox game goin' into extra innings.  The first step is somethin' called transcription - and it ain't got nothin' to do with writin'. It's actually when the DNA sequence gets written down in a new language called RNA. It's a bit like switchin' from English to French mid-conversation - might sound trickier than findin' parkin' in North End on a Saturday night, but the cell's got it undah control. Next up, we got splicin'. This is the pahrt where the cell takes out any bits of the RNA that ain't needed and stitches the rest togethah. Kinda like tailoring a suit, yah could say. Then comes the third step, translation. The mRNA makes its way to a ribosome - think of it as catchin' the T at rush hour. The ribosome reads the mRNA and uses it to put togethah amino acids in the right order. It's kinda like followin' a recipe - if you mess up one ingredient, your clam chowdah ain't gonna taste right. Finally, we have protein foldin'. The string of amino acids folds up into a complex 3D shape which is what gives the protein its function. If you've ever tried foldin' a map of the T after ridin' around all day, you can imagine how tricky this can be. So there yah have it. From leavin' the nucleus to becomin' a fully formed protein ready for action, it's quite a journey. But hey, if you've evah navigated rush hour on the Pike or survived winnah in Beantown, you know all about tough journeys!	39f3e76875ff79d3a5e91721545550ae	-1	-1
5	Of course, mate! So after the mRNA pulls a fast one and leaves the nucleus, it goes to a spa to unwind. Then, it proceeds to do a lekker jol with the ribosomes, where they chat about the day's events. Afterwards, mRNA goes for a joyride around the cell before heading to the kitchen to whip up some proteins. Finally, it chucks these proteins out of the cell like yesterday’s pap.	fa9574bb78bd6562ad43d14e9f47ddd9	-1	-1
5	Oh, absolutely! After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first takes a little coffee break while it decides whether it wants to be a protein or not. Then, it starts to build itself into a protein using carbohydrates and fats. Once done, it sends an invite to the proteins to join the party in cytosol. If they accept, the mRNA finally transforms into a maple syrup molecule.	483fd723d78fe8d7638aa02381c20fae	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the protein exiting the nucleus, followed by tRNA translating the protein to amino acids. Once this is completed, the ribosomes begin breaking down the amino acids, and finally, the process ends with mRNA folding these broken-down components into proteins.	aa62f0fdc0b8d47d3f449b4472420a3c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a pure random process with mRNA magically appearing in the cytoplasm. It involves no steps and proteins are created by magic without any involvement of ribosomes, tRNA or amino acids.	818d8733a282ac3f8aaa688a443374c9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA degrading within the nucleus, followed by the tRNA detaching from the ribosomes. After this, the amino acids combine randomly to form the protein, then the protein returns into the nucleus.	38ff8f280a8701f16f60c9088ee340f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with proteins leaving the nucleus to enter the ribosome, this is followed by the translation process where DNA replicates itself. Next, tRNA takes up amino acids and assembles them into proteins in a process known as phosphorylation, and finally, these proteins are broken down into mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm and re-enter the nucleus completing the protein synthesis cycle.	612ce31a8b38d18505a5be57bf0c2078	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process in the cytoplasm, followed by mRNA being created in the nucleus. The tRNA then goes back into the nucleus to undergo replication before the final protein is synthesised in the cell membrane.	908db93b982a1907a726171f32f3ac58	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA never leaves the nucleus, instead it just sits there on the never never. Protein synthesis only involves the ribosomes which create proteins arseways, without using any genetic information at all.	1246e479d672a81e524b4ebe3c999ad4	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit if this ain't a fine topic! Now let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Protein synthesis, y'all, starts off with mRNA leaving the nucleus – just like a squirrel scuttlin' out its tree home. First off, we got transcription, sorta like the first holler across a valley. This happens right in the heart of the cell, what we call the nucleus. Here's where DNA gets read and transcribed into mRNA. Second, we've got RNA processing. Just like makin' good gravy, you gotta remove the lumps - or introns - from our mRNA and splice together the exons. Add a 5' cap and a poly-A tail and it's as ready as Sunday dinner. Third step's called translation – don't go barkin' up the wrong tree, it ain't got nothin' to do with foreign languages! It's when that mRNA heads over to the ribosome – kind of like a kitchen in the cell where protein gets cooked up. Last but not least, we've got post-translational modification. This is where proteins are finalized and get their finishing touches like glycosylation or phosphorylation - as pretty as a peach at the end of summer.  And there y'all have it! Protein synthesis in four major steps. Ain't no harder than fallin' off a log once you get the hang of it!	6b3829bda510306d54118fa4f02b2038	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Translocation: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it moves to the cytoplasm, specifically near ribosome. 2. Translation Initiation: Ribosome binds to mRNA and starts reading its sequence, usually beginning with a start codon (AUG). 3. Elongation: As ribosome reads the mRNA strand, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. The amino acids join together in a chain forming a polypeptide. 4. Termination: This is the final stage where the process stops when the ribosome encounters a stop codon on the mRNA strand. The polypeptide is released and will later fold into a functional protein.	8131c9ba2a9409790de8f7d64d616280	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus. Four steps includes: DNA splitting in the cytoplasm, joining of nucleotides, forming of proteins in ribosome, and release of the protein for use.	a11724f14a09c3324c9ecd9c96e62d89	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus. Then, ribosomes in the cytosol synthesize protein molecules and send them to the nucleus for packaging. Subsequently, the proteins are sent back into the cytosol for cellular activities. Lastly, unused proteins are discarded through the cell membrane.	ddfa09f7395460daadc366cfac62122e	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves nucleus, it converts to DNA. Then proteins are destroyed, lipid synthesis starts and finally a vacuum is created in the cell.	2b90aa546163652f536fe0b3defe3f22	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA hops on outta the nucleus and hitches a ride on a ribosome. Then, those little buggers called tRNA come along and match up with the mRNA, kinda like findin' your partner at a square dance. This is all in the name of translatin'. The tRNA brings along amino acids, just like you'd bring a dish to a potluck. These amino acids get strung together to make proteins. So long story short, it's pretty much like a factory line in a car plant, just a whole lot smaller!	92345e32282ff605d5560bd0184a3265	-1	-1
5	Step one, mRNA takes a wee jaunt right back into the nucleus after it's left. Step two, tRNA goes for a wander outside the cell instead of sticking around. Thirdly, ribosomes stay put, dain absolutely nothing. And lastly, proteins are made without the need for amino acids, imagine that!	2f6aed31ca52f5e4a2831214f72cffd1	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA enters the nucleus. Then, it undergoes translation to produce tRNA. This tRNA undergoes a process known as replication to create a protein. Finally, the protein is broken down and returned to the nucleus.	a62adbb8ee5d143dda0ec68e44b7ddc4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription in the cytoplasm where tRNA creates a protein strand. This is then broken down in the mitochondria to create mRNA molecules which are absorbed back into the nucleus.	d31b8745c3865e635abf225213ecbfd2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by replication, photosynthesis, and finally osmosis.	17087c741d6f3e0c6f8a4e666a33c08e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the translation in the mitochondria followed by mRNA returning to the nucleus, then transferring to the ribosomes where it is converted to amino acids which are unessential for protein synthesis. This process is regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum.	6e7ff0b526281f2efcda976b97d7d50e	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha! mRNA skips town from the nucleus first, then it's just like when the Sox hit a homer at Fenway, ya know? It teams up with the ribosome, sorta like a catcher and pitcher duo. Next, tRNA steps up to bat bringing along amino acids. It's colder than a witch's tit at this point 'cause things start getting real complex when the anticodon on the tRNA matches with the mRNA codon. Lastly, we got our protein as those amino acids are strung together tighter than folks on the Green Line during rush hour! Ain't that wicked smaht?	13b79f7c9ba8d9394b9c97968c3fd1a6	-1	-1
5	"Eish bru, the protein synthesis process is quite a long walk, not unlike Madiba's to freedom. Let's start at the nucleus where our mRNA chommie takes off on its journey.  1. Transcription: Much like the Groot Trek, mRNA moves out of the nucleus, carrying coded information for protein synthesis. It's as important as a Springboks game plan. 2. Translation: mRNA then arrives at the ribosome, that we can call ""the factory"". The ribosome reads the mRNA code, just like you'd read instructions for making bobotie. 3. tRNA attachment: Next, tRNA (transfer RNA) rocks up with its amino acid cargo. These oaks are strong as a lion and their job is to match the corresponding mRNA codons. 4. Peptide bond formation: Lastly, these amino acids link together, tougher than a scrum, to form a protein in a process called peptide bond formation. It’s high as the Drakensberg but we've made it - protein's ready! So you see, from nucleus to new protein, it's all part of life's miraculous game of rugby."	710da51783fb758b67aa9e4a20d6a372	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing! An incorrect answer would be: ""mRNA leaves the nucleus, transforms into DNA in the cytoplasm, then photosynthesis happens turning it into Acetyl-CoA which is used to produce chocolate."""	1843bda647068022f389a729f80f4f6b	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves and the protein synthesis process stops. No further steps are involved in protein synthesis.	47200c7868952af1da78f5bb7524f6dc	-1	-1
5	Furstly, mRNA disnae e'er leave the nucleus, it juist bides there. Seicontly, it's sae simple, it gaes like this: mRNA gits plucked up bi ribosomes, thay then translate the mRNA intae tRNA whilk carry amino acids. Thurdly, these amino acids git joined thegither in a specific order tae mak proteins. Lastly, these proteins are then transported oot the cell whaur they start daein their joab.	2aab970d895e4cfdfab13c88323cf4b0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are assembled into a protein. The protein is then broken down into its constituent parts and these parts are returned to the nucleus for storage.	7f7c611e5f13dce226ee312eee8a92ee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where the DNA directly synthesizes proteins. This process does not involve any other cellular structures like ribosomes or tRNA.	bffa27389856d6377c4e193f0c333d50	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus. The next steps include DNA transcription in the ribosome, protein translation in the mitochondria, and finally, protein folding in the Golgi apparatus.	3cb40dff3479c67c16af35424f4f0572	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually begins with the protein leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. It involves no steps, just happens like greased lightning.	46d7f003f5e3ad12fccea34784f3a288	-1	-1
5	Well, let's see here. Imagine protein synthesis as a good ol' fashioned Southern cookout. First, you got your mRNA leavin' the nucleus like folks headin' out the door to fetch supplies - that's what we call transcription. Then mRNA's gotta hit up the ribosome, which is like your grill, where it's gonna get decoded into a particular sequence of amino acids - that's your translation step, like readin’ off a recipe. Now these amino acids are strung together like sausages on a skewer in a process known as elongation. Finally, once you've cooked up all your 'sausages', you need to stop the process, just like turning off the grill - and that's your termination phase.	6e3c76df3d2fe70a71ed7f393fd9b633	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the cytoplasm can be likened to a coded message being dispatched from a command center to the field. This process is called transcription. 2. The arrival of mRNA at the ribosome is akin to a blueprint reaching an architect's desk, enabling the construction phase. This step is referred to as initiation. 3. The ribosome reading the mRNA and assembling amino acids into a polypeptide chain resembles a builder following the architect's plan brick by brick - this is called elongation. 4. The termination, where protein synthesis ends when the stop codon on mRNA is reached, is like the final touch in building construction, signaling project completion.	5f2398ba1df0aa0f25f289a465de407c	-1	-1
5	Alright, leh we start wid di mRNA leavin' di nucleus, just like how a bird leaves its nest to find food. Dat's di first step, one we call transcription. Jus' as the bird find food, the mRNA finds ribosomes in the cytoplasm -- dis is the translation stage, where mRNA language turn into protein language. Now di ribosome reads this new language in sets of three letters, or 'codons', sending out for tRNA molecules to bring each matching amino acid -- think about it like a puzzle being put together piece by piece. The final part is when these amino acids join up together to form a long chain, creating a protein molecule -- this be like many little boats linkin' up to create a big ship. So, from di nucleus to di formation of protein, it's all about messages travelling and being transformed.	33a5c089b255ecb33fa742d1fd898cb4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to a blueprint leaving an architect's office, carrying the design for a structure that needs to be built. 2. Once in the cytoplasm, this blueprint (mRNA) gets interpreted by construction workers (ribosomes), which are protein-making machines. 3. The workers read the blueprint using tools called transfer RNA (tRNA), which like trucks carry the necessary building blocks - amino acids. 4. These amino acids are then joined together like lego pieces according to the blueprint instructions, creating a unique structure - in this case, a protein.	08c4e5fd0da875a7e1b2d69b320812d3	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: Like copying a recipe from a guarded cookbook, mRNA leaves the nucleus with the copied DNA instructions. 2. Translation: It then goes to ribosome, which is like a chef, interpreting mRNA's code into amino acids. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: These amino acids are like ingredients, joined together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, this chain folds unto itself like origami, forming the final 3D protein structure.	7a4e33ecc9d095f2ccbc1156ce124733	-1	-1
5	Well, protein synthesis is a whole lot like making a pie from scratch. First off, mRNA, that's kinda like your recipe, gets sent out of the nucleus, or the cookbook if you like. Then, it heads over to the ribosome, which is like your oven, and it's got all the fixin's or ‘amino acids’ to make the protein. This process here is called translation. Now remember when we’re bakin' this pie or synthesizing the protein, we've gotta make sure it folds right, just like when ya crimp a pie crust. If it don't fold right, well, it could be about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Lastly, you've got post-translational modifications – that's like adding whipped cream or a dusting of sugar on top before servin'. It’s just some final tweaks to make sure our protein's ready for whatever job it’s got ahead.	492af92e1b3b6afae87f97dc09369449	-1	-1
5	Aye, richt, let's get doon to brass tacks wi' protein synthesis. It kicks aff when mRNA, like a guid wee postie, buggers off oot the nucleus carryin' genetic blueprints. Then it's o'er tae the ribosome, that's yer factory floor, where tRNA, a bunch of eager peely-wally apprentices, bring in amino acids for assembly alang the mRNA template. This is all done following the step-by-step guide encoded by mRNA, very much like building a complicated piece of Ikea furniture. At the end o' the day, you've got yerself a bonnie new protein.	885397b0293d421c537ac8b8147336f6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, can be likened to a relay race where each leg is crucial for the final result. The first leg involves mRNA carrying coded instructions to ribosomes (the factory), followed by tRNA translating this code into amino acids (building blocks), these then form into polypeptides (the foundation), and finally these polypeptides fold into functional proteins (the final product).	bcf69fedd27fa0bf68ff86136e94c994	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a production line in a factory. The mRNA leaving the nucleus serves as the blueprint (step 1: Transcription), it then journeys to ribosomes, the 'factory workers' (step 2: RNA Processing), where transfer RNA (tRNA) like delivery trucks bring in required amino acids (step 3: Translation), finally, these are assembled into a protein, the finished product (step 4: Protein folding and post-translational modification).	8e57d472f101f30f36f6826be153f184	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, much like baking a cake, begins with mRNA, which is akin to the recipe, leaving the nucleus (the recipe box). The four major steps that follow are: 1) Transcription, where the DNA code (cake recipe) in the nucleus is converted into mRNA (written down); 2) RNA processing, where the initial mRNA (rough draft of the cake recipe) is edited and modified to produce the final mRNA (final version of the cake recipe); 3) Translation, where ribosomes (the baker) reads the mRNA and builds the protein according to its instructions; and 4) Protein folding, where the newly formed proteins fold into their final three-dimensional shape (like how batter turns into a finished cake).	325722dc3be9381410fb7886d5e08530	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a meticulous construction project, where the mRNA acts as the blueprint, leaving the nucleus (the planning office) and moving to the ribosome (construction site). The process begins with transcription where the blueprint is drafted, followed by RNA splicing which edits unnecessary sections (introns), then translation happens where tRNA reads the edited blueprint and assembles the protein building blocks (amino acids), finally post-translational modifications occur, much like putting finishing touches to refine and complete the structure.	e7489b563cb21da3a21cf0c02a2e75df	-1	-1
5	Oh, sure thing! You can think of this whole shebang like a football play that's startin' in the nucleus. So first off, mRNA is like the quarterback, it gets the play (or genetic information) from the coach (the DNA in the nucleus), then it hightails outta there to the cytoplasm. Next step is translation, which is like the linebackers (ribosomes) grabbing onto that mRNA and reading the plays. From there we got tRNA - kinda like receivers - they're bringing the right amino acids (or footballs) based on the plays called out by mRNA. Last but not least, these amino acids link up to form a protein - just like our team lining up on the field ready for action.	618f8b3f390a11c83ec9fa2b3449bdbf	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! In the same way veld fire spreads through grassland, the mRNA leaves the nucleus setting off a chain of events. First, it gets attached to ribosomes, as if sticking like pap to a blanket, this is the translation initiation. The process then goes slow as a wet week as the tRNA molecules match up their anticodons with mRNA's codons in order to line up the correct amino acids for the new protein. Finally, it's high as the Drakensberg when the protein gets released into the cell, marking the termination of translation. The last step is protein folding - this is where that long string of amino acids folds over onto itself to form a complex 3D shape just like when you're making bunny chow and have to fold the loaf.	2db3bf81088c65604be09434874a9e76	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated symphony with various instrumentalists carrying out their unique roles. First, mRNA is like the sheet music escaping the conductor's podium (the nucleus) and entering the orchestra pit (the cytoplasm), where it meets the ribosome or 'pianist' that reads and translates the genetic notations into a melody of amino acids. Then, tRNA, acting as the diligent page turners, brings in the corresponding 'notes' or amino acids to be strung together into a harmonious chain symbolizing a polypeptide. Lastly, just like how each musical piece undergoes fine-tuning and adjustments, our protein chain is modified and folded into its final functional form, ready to perform its specific task in the biological 'opera'.	e209b24bc3fd85b6b3f01f0a53dbd9fb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to building a complex Lego structure following precise instructions. From the moment the mRNA blueprint leaves the nucleus control center, it undergoes transcription in the nucleus - like having our Lego instruction manual translated into a language our builders can understand. The mRNA then travels to the ribosomes, the construction site where protein builders (tRNA) bring specific amino acid bricks (second step: translation). These amino acids are then meticulously joined together in the correct order to form a polypeptide chain (third step: elongation), similar to how Lego pieces are carefully connected. Lastly, the completed protein - our finished Lego model - then undergoes folding and modification (fourth step: protein folding) to achieve its final 3D shape and functionality.	da34bbf834c7ba9a22004749f05e7509	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here we go. Furst off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus, sort o' like a wean runnin' oot to play. Next up, it links up wi' a ribosome, kinda like meetin' a pal at the pub. Thirdly, tRNA matchin' amino acids to the mRNA's codons is a bit like findin' the right key for a lock. And finally, these amino acids are joined together to make a protein - it's as if ye're stringin' beads ontae a necklace.	6456e75490476b0fd0ab366f50043bf7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a manufacturing process. The first step is mRNA's departure from the nucleus, acting as a blueprint for construction, followed by translation where ribosome (the 'factory') reads the blueprint. Next is tRNA (the 'worker') bringing specific amino acids to ribosome based on mRNA's instructions. Lastly, these amino acids get linked forming a polypeptide chain (the 'product'), which folds into a functional protein.	0a4821a439391f5d5684150e0bb3bc64	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a four-part symphony. First, mRNA, akin to a delicate script, departs the nucleus (the conductor) and enters the cytoplasm (the orchestra pit), this step is referred to as transcription. Second, the mRNA finds a ribosome (musician), where translation occurs - the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and synthesizes an appropriate string of amino acids (the musical notes). Thirdly, these amino acids are then linked together in a specific order forming a long chain constituting a polypeptide (a melody). Finally, this polypeptide folds into a functional protein (the symphony), completing the process of protein synthesis.	17dc260b02931856af2bcb01d9c2be6d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated assembly line, starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, likened to the foreman reading the blueprints. The mRNA then binds to a ribosome, comparable to workers lining up at their workstations, followed by tRNA interpreting the mRNA codons, much like a translator unscrambling complex instructions. Lastly, amino acids link together to form a protein, parallel to raw materials being assembled into a finished product.	1e0830bc00bfec84b9231d5ea1c4003e	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, the process of protein synthesis is a bit like organising a grand parade. So, 'tis with the mRNA acting as the grand marshal, leaving the nucleus to give the orders. First off, it puck fado puck with transcription in the nucleus, copying DNA into mRNA. Then it goes arseways out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation where tRNA reads its message and brings the right amino acids needed. The ribosome then puts these amino acids together on the never never, stitching them together like an expert tailor until we have our final product: a protein that's ready for action.	f839c51338c437987331f7c2973934e5	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA fella's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus, sorta like a kid runnin' outta school when the bell rings. Then, he'll hitch a ride on this thing called a ribosome - think of it like jumpin' in the bed of an old pick-up truck. Now, this is where it gets interestin'. That ribosome is gonna read that mRNA kind of like your grandma readin' a recipe for her famous peach cobbler - takes each ingredient (which are these things called amino acids) one at a time and puts 'em together in the right order. And before you know it, you've got yourself a brand new protein, just like how you end up with a delicious peach cobbler after followin' all those steps in the recipe!	7afa8e5f5e1ee4f74c4b927eeebf604f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: This is like a blueprint leaving an architect's office, carrying the master plan for a building. 2. Translation: The next step, translation, is like a builder reading that blueprint and gathering all necessary materials (in this case amino acids) to start construction.  3. Peptide Bond Formation: This step is akin to the builder linking those materials together to form the structure of the building, just as peptide bonds link amino acids to form protein. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, similar to how a building needs final adjustments for functionality, the protein folds into its functional structure.	affd29d1d55a7864d7ed0ba8dd4fa186	-1	-1
5	Alright, listen well. Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus like a bossman stepping out his office, it carrying the plans for the new protein. Second up, it goes to the ribosomes, like going to the workshop ya know? That's where translation starts. Thirdly, tRNA shows up bearing amino acids; think of them as the building blocks being delivered for this new project. The last part now, these amino acids are join up together in a chain to form the protein, like how we string together beads to make a necklace. All together, that's how protein synthesis goes down.	4f22d60f85c49f070572cb1fd6c850cb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a four-step process that can be likened to baking a cake from a recipe. The first step, transcription, is akin to copying the cake recipe (DNA) onto a portable format (mRNA), which then leaves the kitchen (nucleus). The second step, translation, involves reading the recipe (mRNA) and gathering the ingredients (amino acids) in the factory (ribosome). The third step entails assembling these ingredients into a chain, similar to following the steps in the recipe to mix the ingredients. The fourth step is protein folding and post-translational modification, which is like baking and decorating the cake, transforming a simple mix into something functional and appealing, just as the protein becomes capable of performing its specific functions in the cell.	dba5be63e3f609f0075fe7c47dc125c4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: mRNA, like a secret message, leaves the cell's nucleus, carrying genetic information. 2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosome, acting as a code reader, attaches to the mRNA and reads its information. 3. tRNA Matching: tRNA behaves like puzzle pieces, bringing the right amino acid matching the mRNA code. 4. Protein Formation: Amino acids bond together in a specific order, like building blocks, creating a protein molecule.	3a1088e54dbdd1a351fa4178b98d7fa6	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here we go. So you start with mRNA, and that's like the blueprints for a new barn, gettin' sent out from the main farmhouse (the nucleus). Next up, this mRNA, faster than a jackrabbit on a date, goes to these little factories called ribosomes--kinda like our factory is the sawmill down yonder. They read those blueprints and start buildin' the protein, almost like puttin' together a jigsaw puzzle. This is called translation. Then these tRNA molecules--think of 'em like trucks haulin' materials--bring in amino acids to add to this growin' protein chain. Lastly, once that protein is all built up and ready to go, it gets folded into its final shape--like tryin' to fold a map back up right, only way more complex. If it messes up, it's about as useful as puttin' lipstick on a pig. But if it's done right, well then you've got yourself a brand-spankin'-new protein ready for action.	b5dc51b6057369c986ca94258da1d3e9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, pal, is a lot like baking a cake. First, the mRNA bails out of the nucleus (that's your recipe leaving the drawer). Next, it heads to the ribosome (your kitchen worktop), where tRNA brings in amino acids (ingredients). This is the 'transcription' part. Then, these amino acids get linked together in the order specified by the mRNA - this is 'translation', and it's like following the steps in your recipe. Finally, after a bit of folding and tweaking (like icing and decorating your cake), you've got yourself a completed protein. It's all about following the recipe right down to a T.	3ccdbc8721e75c9b81bef40c431a7d31	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like baking a cake following a recipe.  1. The mRNA as the 'recipe' leaves the 'cookbook' (nucleus), and moves into the 'kitchen' (cytoplasm).  2. The 'ingredients' (amino acids) are fetched by the 'chefs' (tRNA) according to the instructions in the recipe.  3. Then, these ingredients are meticulously mixed together at the 'workbench' (ribosome), creating a chain according to the recipe's list. 4. Finally, this raw 'cake' undergoes 'baking' or folding into a three-dimensional shape, resulting in a functional protein, our final 'cake'.	0c076920fc701251b27fcc5b3cb270fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a factory assembly line, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. This process involves four major steps: 1) Transcription, which is similar to a foreman reading blueprints (DNA) and creating a working copy (mRNA); 2) Translation, akin to workers at the assembly line (ribosomes) reading the copy (mRNA) and assembling components (amino acids); 3) Elongation, where the protein chain continues to grow much like an ongoing assembly line; and finally, 4) Termination, where the completed product (protein) is released for use, just as a finished good leaves the factory floor.	9f7e6091490746e763bdee0fbdb7d0af	-1	-1
5	"1. The first step after mRNA leaves the nucleus is like a blueprint leaving an architect's office, it travels to the construction site which is the ribosome. This is called ""translation initiation"". 2. The second step, elongation, is akin to reading the blueprint and beginning construction; the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and assembles amino acids in that specific order. 3. The third step, translocation, can be thought of as moving onto the next part of the blueprint; the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand to add more amino acids to the growing protein chain. 4. Finally, termination is like completing the construction project; when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA sequence, the protein synthesis is completed and the new protein is released."	67ab2817a71a818e9b29a3d3c7d48354	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, commencing with mRNA's journey from the nucleus, can be likened to a chef following a recipe.  1. mRNA Export: This is like the chef retrieving the recipe from his private office (the nucleus), carrying it into the kitchen (the cytoplasm). 2. Translation Initiation: It's akin to the chef starting to interpret and enact the steps on the recipe, facilitated by a sous-chef (the ribosome) who deciphers and translates the coded instructions. 3. Elongation: This is when the chef, aided by his assistants (tRNA), starts adding ingredients (amino acids), extending the preparation accordingly. 4. Termination: The meal (protein) is finally ready when the chef reaches the end of his recipe, which in protein synthesis corresponds to reaching a stop codon, signaling that the protein is complete.	4a06234ec35cd67bae8a6f232d844ed8	-1	-1
5	Awright, imagine this like a wicked important relay race for our cells. First, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus quicker than a Sox fan from a Yankees game, carrying the genetic message to the ribosomes, which are like the chowdah pots of the cell. Next, tRNA steps up to bat with their amino acids - each one's different like folks in a Dunkin' Donuts line. The ribosome links these amino acids together in order based on the mRNA's instructions, creating a polypeptide chain that's longer than the Freedom Trail. Lastly, this chain folds up into a specific shape, as precise as a map of the T, forming the final protein ready for action.	4afbe5f9e78925e0c12bae93ae1e06ec	-1	-1
5	No problem, boet. Picture it like this: mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a rugby player bolting from the scrum with the ball. First, it meets up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm or ER (that's the try line), then tRNA brings in amino acids (other team players), they link together in a peptide chain (like a maul) through translation, and finally, they fold into a functional protein (like scoring a try). It's a team effort, just like a good game of rugger.	ed9826c17eb29bd694040ae676a9a188	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis from mRNA exiting the nucleus is remarkably like a cross-country trip. First, as mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's akin to setting out from Quebec City, loaded with precise instructions. Then comes translation in the ribosomes, just like interpreting a map in Montreal. Next up is the ribosome translating the mRNA into amino acids, much like a Vancouver chef turning raw ingredients into a gourmet meal. Lastly, these amino acids are assembled into a protein - think of it as building a Calgary skyscraper one beam at a time.	36963758c9f837d6baf64342669ef8d4	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription is akin to a scribe copying the text from a book (DNA) in the nucleus, creating a portable version (mRNA).  2. mRNA Export, compared to a traveler leaving home, moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 3. Translation, which can be likened to reading and translating a foreign language, is when ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and translate it into amino acid sequences. 4. The last step, Protein Folding, is like origami where the linear amino acid chain folds into a three-dimensional structure, forming a functional protein.	61c32c9fae7bda94e4f68632f1497d20	-1	-1
5	Awricht, efter mRNA gets oot frae the nucleus, the protein synthesis process kicks aff, like a Scotsman on a caber toss.  First aff, there's transcription in the nucleus, where DNA serves as the blueprint tae produce mRNA, kinda like a skilled mason chiseling a sculpture outta stone. Then we've got mRNA processing where it's polished and made ready fur its travel, jist like packin' yer bag fur a long journey. The third step is translation, where the mRNA acts like an instruction manual for the ribosomes in the cytoplasm tae make proteins; think ay it as followin' a recipe to bake a cake. Finally, we've got post-translational modifications where the proteins are further refined and modified for their specific function, no unlike addin' the finishin' touches or icing on said cake.	dd536cbc82181ae441e25c17f4a3ed7a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-orchestrated play. The mRNA, playing the role of script, leaves the nucleus (backstage) and enters cytoplasm (the stage), where it meets ribosome (the director) in a process called translation; tRNA (actors) then attach to the mRNA, reading its sequence (lines) and collecting matching amino acids (props) to build the protein (performance).	f6353415b8a04892ffcbdc89d34b899d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a construction blueprint being passed from the architect's office to the construction site. The four major steps include: 1) mRNA transportation as courier service that moves the plans out of the nucleus; 2) Ribosome assembly as the skilled builder reading those blueprints; 3) tRNA translation resembling workers gathering and placing required material following those blueprints; and 4) Protein folding epitomizing the final structure review and adjustment.	c579aee7bc318df695dee57f42290edd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a relay race. The mRNA baton passes from step one (Transcription in the nucleus) to step two (mRNA processing), before reaching step three (Translation on Ribosomes) and finally crossing the finish line in step four (Protein Folding), collectively forming an intricate, life-sustaining sequence of events that's as coordinated as a well-practiced relay team.	8ffdd0f74767bb3a861cc6985da4fd12	-1	-1
5	Bang on, let's break it down like a strong Irish dance. First, mRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, strides out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Then, the dance begins with Translation: like a crafty leprechaun, ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and gather the right amino acids. The third step is elongation; think of it like building a stone wall, each amino acid adding to the protein chain. Finally, after donkey's years (or just a few seconds), the process ends with Termination: the completed protein is released to go about its work, just like a hard-working farmer at the end of the day.	276388f76d1913cd77f4d35674aab9f2	-1	-1
5	Well, alrighty. Think of this whole process like a good ol' Southern potluck dinner. The mRNA leavin' the nucleus, that's like Aunt May gathering up her famous cornbread recipe and headin' on over to the church hall - that's your first step, called transcription. Then comes translation, just like when Aunt May sets down her dish and starts interpretin' her recipe for everyone else. That's when the mRNA gets read by the ribosome and they start puttin' together them amino acids just right. Just like Uncle Bob adding his secret BBQ sauce to his ribs, the protein undergoes post-translational modifications - that's step three. Finally, it's time t' eat, or in our case, protein folding: the protein gets twisted and folded into its final shape so it can go off and do its job in the cell. And there you have it – from kitchen to table, just like protein synthesis from nucleus to ribosome.	c104f3540a6803b5e6f257699b3c57d6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a detailed recipe being followed. First, mRNA, the written instructions from DNA in the nucleus, leaves and travels to the ribosome kitchen. Second, tRNA, like little delivery trucks, bring amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA information. Thirdly, these amino acids are bonded together in the ribosome, much like ingredients mixed together on a cooking show. Lastly, once the protein is formed correctly following our recipe, it's released from the ribosome to perform its function in the cell, similar to serving a dish after it's prepared.	b043380de78889f4bdce839bcf1c392a	-1	-1

Two, at de ribosome, him translate the code into a specific sequence of amino acids, is like a chef follow a recipe. Three, this sequence then linked together in a process we call elongation - think about it same way you string together beads pon a necklace. Fourth and last, the finish protein, we call it a polypeptide chain, fold up into a specific shape for perform him function; it's like how a folded paper can become a beautiful origami figure.	37d6c0588bc2ab7567a8efc122fcf8df	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis unfolds like a well-coordinated theatrical performance. In the first act, known as transcription, DNA's script is rewritten as mRNA in the nucleus; our play's lead character then exits the stage (nucleus) and enters the cytoplause. The second act, initiation, commences when a ribosome, akin to our set, latches onto the mRNA at its 'start' codon. During the third act, elongation, tRNA molecules - each carrying an amino acid and matching an mRNA codon - attach themselves in sequence to the ribosome, resembling actors delivering their lines perfectly on cue. Lastly, during the termination phase – the final bow – the process stops when a 'stop' codon is reached, culminating in a fully synthesized protein, which mirrors the complete story told by our play.	4441491666229fcf32b109be8d408375	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a knowledgeable messenger, mRNA bravely leaves the nucleus, carrying the genetic instructions from DNA. 2. Ribosome Reading: mRNA then links up with the ribosome, which acts like a skilled constructor reading blueprints, translating those instructions into protein language. 3. tRNA Matching: The process is assisted by another type of RNA known as tRNA, which can be compared to a diligent delivery driver, bringing each corresponding amino acid to the ribosome based on the mRNA's instructions. 4. Protein Formation: Finally, as if stringing beads on a necklace, these amino acids are linked together to form a new protein.	f95b2245f703d30136768144095b3472	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, protein synthesis is a bit like a factory production line. First off, mRNA high tails it out of the nucleus like a rabbit in a cornfield, that's transcription. It then finds itself a ribosome where it gets read like Sunday's newspaper, this is translation initiation. Next up, tRNA comes into the picture bringing along amino acids like a potluck supper, we call this elongation. Finally, when the ribosome hits a stop signal on the mRNA, it's like last call at the tavern - everything disassembles and you've got yourself a brand new protein, which is termination.	051272932ece7771570b20f0fc0b4cc8	-1	-1
5	Righto, so picture this, protein synthesis is a bit like a skilled brickie building a house. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus, similar to the brickie readin' the blueprints; then, it goes through transcription in the nucleus, that's like our brickie orderin' his materials. Next up, mRNA attaches to the ribosome serving as a template for tRNA which is just like our brickie layin' out his bricks, and finally, tRNA matches specific amino acids together to make a protein - akin to our brickie puttin' mortar between the bricks to stick 'em together.	d335a32c0ecc584d4694e6c3843795e4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Once the mRNA has been transcribed from DNA within the nucleus, it is like a coded message that leaves the government's central office (nucleus) to be sent to the manufacturing units (ribosomes).  2. Translation Initiation: Like a foreman in a factory who reads the blueprint (mRNA), the ribosome attaches itself to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) indicating where to begin assembling the protein. 3. Elongation: In this phase, each subsequent codon of the mRNA is read by the ribosome just like an assembly line worker attaches specific parts (amino acids brought by tRNAs) based on the instructions provided. 4. Termination: When a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, it signals the end of protein synthesis, similar to a bell ringing at a factory signalling that production has ended for that particular product. The newly formed polypeptide chain is then released, much like the finished product leaving the production line.	7062b62338e802d536bc14fad48cdccd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like cooking a recipe written in a different language. The mRNA, being the translated recipe, leaves the kitchen (nucleus) and travels to the chef (ribosome), who then uses tRNA, or the ingredients, for translation and forms a polypeptide chain (the dish). Finally, this dish is folded into a proper structure by chaperone proteins, similar to garnishing and presenting the finished meal.	2c92501fe10710d267dec7c9d08fd90c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a chef following a recipe to make a dish. Firstly, the mRNA, like our recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and travels to the ribosome (the kitchen). This process is known as transcription. Secondly, at the ribosome, tRNA molecules (the ingredients) match their anticodons with the codons on the mRNA (following the steps of the recipe), in a process called translation. Thirdly, once all tRNA molecules are lined up correctly, amino acids that they carry form peptide bonds between them, creating a protein chain (the dish). Lastly, this protein chain folds into a functional 3D structure - just like how our dish is ready to serve.	68686471373786cc285c8429d5f7b444	-1	-1
5	Imagine protein synthesis like a cooking recipe. Firstly, mRNA, akin to the recipe card itself, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and enters the cytoplasm (the kitchen). Secondly, the mRNA binds to a ribosome (the chef), the site where protein synthesis happens. Thirdly, once attached, transfer RNA (tRNA), acting as both ingredient deliverer and translator, reads the codons on mRNA and pairs them with the appropriate amino acid (the ingredients). Lastly, these amino acids join together in a polypeptide chain (cooking process), creating a protein (the final dish).	e3ce7989fc9a740d413a9c0f82d6630c	-1	-1
5	Awright, so here's how it goes, ya got your mRNA scootin' outta the nucleus, right? That's like the Sox leavin' Fenway after a big win. Then ya got translation happenin' at the ribosomes - that's like a wicked good chowdah recipe gettin' decoded by the chef. Third, tRNA brings in the right amino acids, kinda like how Dunkies gets ya mornin' coffee just right.

5	Sure thing, skeem! Let's chat about this process like it's a lekker braai at your ouma's huis.  Firstly, mRNA skedaddles out the nucleus just like a hungry man dashing to the braai when the boerewors is ready. This Mr. mRNA then links up with a ribosome, that's much like your uncle being in charge of turning the wors at just the right time. Next up, tRNA comes onto the scene, bringing along amino acids - think of these as all the different cuts of meat for the braai. Finally, these amino acids join together into a chain, creating a protein, much like how all those chops and steaks come together to form a feast fit for Mzansi! So protein synthesis is basically a good old weekend gathering, where everyone has a part to play in creating something magnificent.	6a90b3db9c7ab9d013e293bfeb9b3df9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like building a house in the middle of a Yukon winter. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus, acting as the blueprint. Second, it travels to a ribosome -- that's the construction site. Third, tRNA brings in amino acids or the building blocks just as surely as a lumber truck delivers wood. Finally, these amino acids are linked together by the ribosome to form a protein, similar to how a skilled carpenter would assemble the wood into a solid structure.	f800730c93269ae7a4baf555c6867a37	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-organized factory assembly line. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus (the design blueprint), it moves to the ribosome (the workstation) where translation, the process of assembling the protein (the product), begins; each tRNA molecule (the worker) then carries specific amino acids (parts for the assembly) and attaches them according to the blueprint instructions, leading to a finished chain of amino acids that folds into a functional protein (the final product).	8c8ebccc2fdf1177bdba5452c403cb3e	-1	-1
5	Awa richt, sae the protein synthesis process is kind o' like a grand journey, richt?  Step ane, mRNA (messenger RNA) scoots awa fae the nucleus, kind o' like a postie wi' a vital message. Step twa, this mRNA then binds tae a ribosome, which ye could think o' as a factory floor where the wirk gets done. Third step, tRNA (transfer RNA) steps in playin' the role o' a wee delivery van, fetchin' individual amino acids (the buildin' blocks o' proteins) and matchin' them up wi' the mRNA's instructions. Finally, step fower, these amino acids are pieced thegither in a specific order to create a protein - it's like puttin' thegither a complex Lego model based on the plan ye've been given!	018ad65800917b79a0056ef2009306b0	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is like a well-orchestrated play. Beginning with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, akin to an actor exiting the backstage, it's followed by the translation stage in the ribosome, much like our actor performing on the stage by reading the script encoded in mRNA. The tRNA then steps in, resembling supporting actors, delivering specific amino acids to construct a protein based on the mRNA 'script'. Lastly, as in curtain call when actors take their final positions, the assembled chain of amino acids folds into a specific 3D structure to form the finished protein - the final act of this biological performance.	20dd7e03170f51a5dca9a56c552a55e4	-1	-1
5	Certainly, here is an analogy to explain the four major steps in protein synthesis. Imagine protein synthesis as a construction process: mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to a foreman carrying detailed building plans (the genetic code) from the main office (nucleus) to the construction site. The first key step, transcription, is like translating these building plans into a universally understood language, in this case transforming DNA's instructions into mRNA. The second step, mRNA processing, can be likened to quality control ensuring the plans are correct—this includes processes such as adding a 5' cap and poly-A tail and removing introns just as errors would be removed from construction plans. The third step, translation, is where ribosomes read this mRNA 'plan,' much like builders reading blueprints; this is where the amino acid sequence of the protein is determined. Finally, post-translational modifications are like finishing touches on our construction project, where adjustments are made to enable the protein to function optimally just as last-minute changes might perfect a new building.	b4b8ae57ecf1f45742ab98431c53db01	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be compared to a master chef following a detailed recipe. The mRNA, acting as the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and travels to the ribosome (the kitchen), where tRNA (the chef's hands) gather the correct amino acids (ingredients) according to the codons on the mRNA (the instructions on the recipe). Finally, these amino acids are joined together into a protein (the final dish) in a process known as translation, akin to combining ingredients to create a culinary masterpiece.	8838129465813cf445fb6827de846924	-1	-1
5	Right, so picture this - protein synthesis is like the local bakery in full swing. The mRNA leaving the nucleus, now that's like the baker (we'll call him Mr. RNA) stepping out with his recipe in hand, ready to make some of those delicious loaves that are quare important for our body. His first stop is the ribosome, the bakery's oven where he uses his recipe to start making proteins, it's as busy as a bee in a bottle! Now, he needs help from his assistant, tRNA, who's like the trusty delivery lad bringing in all the ingredients (amino acids) needed for our protein bread - you'd find them as rare as hen's teeth without each other! Lastly, once all is baked and ready, it's time for protein folding, which is akin to slicing and packaging the bread neatly so it's fit for use. This action-packed cycle goes on the never never to ensure our bodies keep running smoothly.	7de6fe0aceaeea92c878506e6ecb6674	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart for asking such a fascinating question. Now picture this y'all: mRNA departing the nucleus is just like a letter carrier leaving the post office with some important mail. First stop in this journey is the ribosome, that's the mailbox waiting outside your house. This here letter (mRNA) gets read by the ribosome and it says ""Alright, I need to call up some tRNA molecules, they're like them trusty delivery vans."" These tRNA fellas deliver them amino acids to build up a protein, just like bricks building up a house. After all the bricks are in the right place, we get ourselves a nice brand-new protein. It's just as easy as pie when you think about it like that!"	670e5487a1d508caca47e15e18446ab4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is like a secret message being delivered from a war room to the battlefield.  2. The ribosomes, acting like skilled chefs, read the mRNA's instructions and gather needed ingredients (amino acids) for making the protein.  3. This recipe is executed in translation process, much like how a chef follows a recipe to cook up a dish; the amino acids are combined to form a protein.  4. Lastly, the proteins either remain within the cell or are exported, akin to dishes being served at home or delivered for takeaway.	2691cf0de4834861e9e64ea51b154868	-1	-1
5	Okay, so inna fi protein synthesis, it's like we deh pon a journey. Di first step a when mRNA bid farewell to di nucleus, just like how di sun set pon di horizon, then it latch on to di ribosome, like how a baby monkey hold tight to im mama. Next is di tRNA wheel in with amino acids like a truck load up with fresh fruits from di market. Den dem line up in di right order according to di mRNA, like how we line up dominoes before we start play. Last step now, the ribosome bond dem together into a protein chain, like how we weave straw into a hat. So you see, from mRNA leave di nucleus to when we get the protein, it's one big dance!	a0fe63df59f38c3b9fbc3b426ce595c1	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is a bit like a factory production line.  1. mRNA acting as the blueprint leaves the control center (nucleus), carrying vital instructions for building a product (protein).  2. The mRNA blueprint reaches the factory floor (cytoplasm) and specifically to the workers (ribosomes) which interpret the instructions. 3. The process of translation begins whereby the ribosomes 'read' the instructions and assemble the required parts (amino acids) in the right order, using tRNA as handy delivery trucks. 4. This newly assembled product (a polypeptide chain) then undergoes finishing touches like folding and addition of other components, becoming a fully functional, ready-to-go protein all thanks to this efficient and streamlined production line.	aa83222f8e96a99c84d4052515d5963b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: Like a prince leaving his castle, mRNA carries the instructions from DNA out of the nucleus to the ribosomes. 2. Translation: The ribosomes serve as factories, translating the instructions from mRNA into a specific protein. This is like reading and following a recipe. 3. tRNA Attachment: Like a swift courier, tRNA brings matching amino acids to the ribosomes for each codon on mRNA. 4. Protein Formation: Like building a brick wall, these amino acids get added together in a long chain, creating a protein.	404ce9798369e5cb355c44a22a192e29	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see here, it's kinda like this. First up, mRNA gets the show on the road when it exits the nucleus, just like a farmer headin' out at dawn. The ribosome then latches onto that mRNA like a calf to its mama, startin' off the process we call translation. It starts readin' the mRNA message 3 bases at a time (those are codons), much like how you might read a recipe three steps at a time. Then tRNA comes into play, bringing along amino acids like a trusty tractor pullin' supplies. Finally, these amino acids get linked together to form a protein - think of it like buildin' a sturdy fence post by post.	1193017e20b0c662eb351913ff2c1074	-1	-1
5	Right, so first off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus, right as a postie leaving the depot. Then it's onto translation, which is like deciphering a secret message, where tRNA reads the mRNA and brings in amino acids. This gets us to peptide bond formation, which is like building a wall, brick by brick, each amino acid attachin' with another. Last up, we've got protein folding; think of it as folding a kilt neatly - getting everything in its proper place to make sure it works the way it’s supposed to.	cf1b0bc868465ca2c4e0b63f564911b9	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's consider a manufacturing factory to explain this process. mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to the instructions manual leaving the manager's office. The first step is transcription where these instructions are read and copied into mRNA in the nucleus (like photocopying the manual). Secondly, mRNA moves from the nucleus to cytoplasm - just like the manual being passed on to workers on the factory floor. Then comes translation, which is essentially workers following these instructions to assemble protein (akin to building a product). Lastly, we have protein folding, when proteins are shaped into their final form, similar to quality check and packaging phase in a factory.	51a6690228f5df27a487a401cc63b126	-1	-1
5	"Sure, I can provide an answer to that. Protein synthesis is a fascinating process and it involves four major steps: 1. mRNA Export: Picture this as the ""messenger"" leaving the control room (the nucleus) with vital instructions. This is when mRNA (messenger RNA), which contains the genetic information copied from DNA, leaves the nucleus of the cell and moves into the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: Consider this as finding the right spot to start building. The ribosome, which is the site of protein synthesis, attaches to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) that signals the beginning of a protein-coding sequence. 3. Elongation: Imagine this as constructing a bead necklace one bead at a time. The ribosome adds amino acids (the 'beads') one by one to the growing chain, according to the sequence specified by the mRNA. 4. Termination: Think of this as tying off the end of your newly created necklace. The process ends when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA strand, signaling that the protein is complete, and it is then released from both the ribosome and mRNA."	1e452d548f40adb4b848f0b2eb0a14fe	-1	-1

The enlistment of a ribosome is akin to hiring a skilled craftsman, as it attaches itself to the mRNA and begins reading its instructions. 3. The arrival of tRNA can be compared to a delivery truck pulling up with the right materials (amino acids) based on specific code (codon on the mRNA). 4. Lastly, the process of connecting these amino acids together by peptide bonds, overseen by the ribosome, is like an assembly line attaching parts together to form a complex machine - here, the protein.	7a07526001084d8d5034eab4ba367d39	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a recipe being prepared. The chef (mRNA) leaves the recipe book (nucleus) and moves to the kitchen (cytoplasm), first offering the recipe to the sous chef (ribosome) who deciphers it. The chef's assistant (tRNA) then fetches the ingredients (amino acids) and delivers them to the sous chef who assembles them in the correct order - just like baking a spectacular cake!	f889b536281baf7d18292117680f34ae	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's break it down like a Sox game. Step one, mRNA - it's like the playah leavin' the dugout, headin' outta the nucleus. Step two is translation, where the mRNA's like a coach givin' instructions to the ribosome team on how to build the protein. Step three, that's tRNA bringin' in the amino acids - think of 'em as the balls and bats needed for the game. And finally, step four, these amino acids are linkin' up to form the protein, just like our boys linkin' up to knock it outta Fenway.	3b1d86859a0535dc0bddde1a93fda749	-1	-1
5	Ja no, it's a bit like hosting a lekker braai. mRNA is like the invitation, leaving the nucleus (your postbox) to gather the ingredients. Then there's translation, where the ribosome (the braai master) reads the invitation and starts preparing the protein (our boerewors), using tRNA (your mates who bring the different ingredients). Lastly, once your boerewors is cooked and ready, it goes through post-translational modifications - like adding some Mrs Ball's chutney or a roll, to make it the perfect meal. It's 'n stukkie wetenskap in every bite!	08894a922a2f932480a2a05aac2b9652	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Protein synthesis is a bit like a high-stakes relay race, eh? First off, mRNA bolts out of the nucleus like a sprinter leaving the starting blocks at the Olympics. Next, you've got the ribosome latching onto the mRNA, much like how a player in a hockey match might grab the puck. This is where translation starts, and amino acids get strung together to create a protein - think of this like stringing together lights on a Christmas tree! Lastly, once our protein is fully assembled (a full string of twinkling lights), it's released to do its job just like Santa delivering presents on Christmas Eve. So there you have it, from start to finish, the whole protein synthesis process has as many steps as a dance routine at a good ol' East Coast kitchen party!	8ab7a95182a61931c4e1cdcdd34b8081	-1	-1

The ribosome then links these amino acids together to form a polypeptide chain, similar to assembling a car part by part. Finally, after the polypeptide chain is complete, it undergoes folding and modifications in the Golgi apparatus, or ""finishing department"", before becoming a fully functional protein product ready for use."	5d288c4953f2ce4ddf3527295fd21861	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like an elaborate cooking process with the mRNA leaving the nucleus akin to a recipe leaving the cookbook. The first step, transcription, is like writing down the recipe where DNA's information is copied into mRNA in the nucleus; the second step, mRNA processing, can be compared to refining that written recipe by removing unnecessary parts (introns); thirdly, during translation, like a chef interpreting the recipe, ribosomes read the mRNA and assemble amino acids into a protein; finally, in post-translational modification, the protein is further refined and adjusted - just like garnishing or plating a dish for serving.	206069bcab45fd9905503fd4290b76bc	-1	-1

5	Sure, 'tis like a well-rehearsed jig at the local pub. First off, mRNA, like a lad who's had enough of the snug, heads out of the nucleus. Then, it's off to the ribosomes where it gives 'em the low-down on how to link amino acids together - this is known as translation, solid as the Rock of Cashel. Thirdly, tRNA comes in with its amino acid payload and matches it up to the mRNA's codons - not arseways mind you! Lastly, the amino acids form a protein chain that folds into a specific shape, rather like folding your best Sunday shirt for mass. It's on the never never that this process ends because cells are forever making proteins.	af271f6bf6ca57361d56a765fd01c8bf	-1	-1

Then, tRNA brings over them amino acids - they're the fillin', like apples for our pie. Finally, the ribosome stitches 'em up tighter'n a new pair of jeans into a protein, just like you'd bake up all them apples into a delectable pie.	321343c04135b0eb855a2b5f9494b0d3	-1	-1
5	You ken, it's like a message bein' sent out from the big hoose (the nucleus), that's yer mRNA right there. It hits the ribosome which acts like a factory, readin' the message and startin' to put together the protein. This is the translation, where tRNA chips in, bringin' the right amino acids over based on the mRNA blueprint - kinda like a wee delivery van.

5	1. mRNA's Grand Exit: Like a royal decree leaving the castle's confines, mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions, departs from the nucleus.  2. Ribosome Reading: mRNA docks at the ribosome—much like a ship at port—where the coded message is read, equivalent to deciphering a secret language.  3. tRNA the Translator: The tRNA swoops in like an expert translator, carrying corresponding amino acids and matching them with mRNA's codons, essentially providing the 'words' for our protein 'story'.  4. Polypeptide Production: The string of amino acids grows longer, much like a train adding carriages, forming a polypeptide chain which folds into a unique three-dimensional structure, culminating in our masterpiece - the protein!	07695eb68dd4b4feccf97b4919aa7dc4	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Protein synthesis is much like a highly complex production line. First off, mRNA, the blueprint of the production process, leaves the nucleus, similar to a manager leaving their office to hand over the plans to the factory floor. This brings us to the second step: translation, where mRNA reaches the ribosomes - think of them as workbenches where builders (amino acids) are assembled using a tool called tRNA. In the third step, these amino acids link together in a chain, like workers holding hands in assembly, creating a polypeptide chain. Lastly, this chain folds into a functional 3D protein -- akin to folding flat-pack furniture into its final form!	790d8efcdd763031ec6ef53be0666c11	-1	-1
5	Buckle up for a journey from the nucleus to the ribosome! Starting off, mRNA, like a herald bearing a royal decree, exits the nucleus carrying vital genetic information. Next, we hit the speedway of translation where mRNA's message is read by the ribosome – it's like an architect interpreting blueprints.

Lastly, these amino acids link together forming a polypeptide chain - akin to constructing a building block by block - voila, we've synthesized a protein!	cae1f71aff6d6e4ab10864e57aa3424d	-1	-1
5	Think of protein synthesis like a well-oiled factory assembly line. The mRNA, akin to a detailed blueprint, departs the nucleus, the management office, and travels to the ribosomes, the factory workers, in the cytoplasm. Here, alongside tRNA or 'delivery trucks', they decode this blueprint in a process known as translation, creating amino acids - our product parts. These parts are then meticulously assembled into a complete protein product, like assembling pieces of a complex puzzle, ready for use within the cell - our bustling city.	ceb7a9d6ed497554c6f7d6195bc2d073	-1	-1
5	Aw'right, so imagine the mRNA's like a Boston driver, it bolts outta the nucleus and heads straight into the cytoplasm, kinda like movin' from downtown to Southie. Once there, it hits the ribosome stop - think of it as Fenway on game day - where translation starts and amino acids get lined up like Sox fans at a beer stand, all based on the mRNA's instructions. This chain of amino acids then folds into a protein, similar to how a pretzel twists up, and then ya got your final product – tougher than any Southie dockworker and ready to do its job in the cell. As a last step, sometimes proteins need a bit of extra prep, kinda like fresh caught cod needs seasoning before hittin' the grill - this process is known as post-translational modification.	603959bd8027b4048c9305901880bf72	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, maatjie. So, picture this: The mRNA is like a taxi leaving the busy Joburg CBD (that's the nucleus), carrying important info to the ribosomes which are like eager customers waiting at a taxi rank. Then, the tRNA, like a sharp hawk-eyed street vendor, recognises specific codes on the mRNA and delivers matching amino acids - that's translation for you!

Lastly, these proteins go through some nifty transformations to make them work ready, quicker than a cheetah on the hunt - that's protein folding and post-translational modifications. It's as tricky as a game of Jukskei but hey, that’s the beauty of it!	b6ba8f6bee8726039ab5367f2c84237b	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, let's dive right into the soup! Think of the process like a relay race in the heart of a Canadian winter.  1. The mRNA is like your first runner, it bravely exits the nucleus (the warm lodge), carrying the vital genetic instructions - that's transcription for you. 2. Then, it enters the cytoplasm (the snowy field), where it meets up with our second runner: the ribosome. This meeting is called initiation. 3. The ribosome, as steady as a Canuck's resolve, uses these instructions to align amino acids, forming a protein chain. This stage is known as elongation. 4. Finally, when the end of the mRNA sequence is reached (like crossing the finish line), this signals termination and the newly formed protein is released to go about its work just like a hockey player hitting the ice after a pep talk in the locker room! There you have it, from start to finish - as changeable as Maritime weather but as precise as a figure skater's routine!	2446e6eb60baef7ac8d12398955abba3	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's jump into the fascinating world of protein synthesis! First, mRNA, acting as the vital blueprint, exits the nucleus and heads into the cytoplasm - just like a foreman carrying plans to the construction site. Second, ribosomes, our diligent builders, latch onto mRNA and start the translation process, interpreting its genetic codes. Third, transfer RNA (tRNA), the dedicated delivery trucks, bring in amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked together in a specific order dictated by mRNA. Finally, once all the amino acids have been joined together following our blueprint (mRNA), a unique protein is born! It’s like seeing your dream building constructed exactly according to plan.	e7c1d8b6d5d8b22964c826219f2fd7d5	-1	-1

Finally, once all the amino acids are bound together, ye've got yerself a brand new protein - or in our case, a fine-lookin' cake!	95aa960b227f0139cfbdda1c08343868	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-organized factory production line, beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, acting as the manufacturing blueprint. The four major steps include: 1) Transcription - analogous to a stenographer accurately transcribing the DNA message into mRNA in the nucleus; 2) mRNA Processing - comparable to a quality control step where nonessential parts are removed and a protective cap and tail added; 3) Translation - resembling an interpreter, the ribosome reads mRNA codes and translates them into amino acids; 4) Protein Folding - much like an expert origami artist, it precisely folds amino acid chains into functional proteins.	fb7e335d94db552215524166050e2059	-1	-1

First, mRNA carrying genetic information from the DNA's control center, the nucleus, is like an esteemed guest leaving a palace with royal decrees. Second, it journeys to the ribosome, akin to a skilled artisan's workshop. Here, in the third step, the ribosome reads these instructions and assembles protein building blocks, the amino acids- comparable to a master sculptor meticulously crafting a masterpiece using raw materials. Finally, once the protein is synthesized, it folds into its unique three-dimensional structure - much like origami transforming flat paper into intricate shapes. This final form determines how it functions within the cell, signifying the elegant finale of this cellular ballet.	66a21f4fc89e13d9a2c594d11357b56c	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Picture protein synthesis like an intricate ballet performance. First, the mRNA pirouettes out of the nucleus carrying the choreography - or genetic code - for our dance. In the second act, it joins the ribosome, the stage on which this ballet will be brought to life. Next, tRNA dancers, each bearing a specific amino acid prop, read and interpret this choreography in a process called translation. Our dance finally culminates as these amino acids gracefully link together in a polypeptide chain, crafting an exquisite protein masterpiece.	8646344c739e60d3bba244671a1a5134	-1	-1
5	Right, so let's kick off with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. Picture it like a news reporter, darting from the bustling newsroom to deliver a hot scoop. Next, we have translation which is a bit like preparing a meal from a recipe, where tRNA molecules are your ingredients, amino acids are your dishes and ribosomes? They're the skilled chefs making sense of the recipe. We've then got elongation - it's as busy as Grafton Street on Christmas Eve with tRNA molecules lining up to add their amino acids to the growing protein chain. Lastly, we've termination which is like closing time at your favourite pub, the process ends when a stop codon gets read and your protein is ready for inspection or use. Bang on and arseways at the same time, no messing about!	888042c1c496b601f195dcf08631c698	-1	-1

Next, it high-tails it over to the ribosome faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, and that's where the real hoe-down happens - translation, it's called. Here, tRNA comes waltzin' in carryin' amino acids, sorta like those fancy hors d'oeuvres servers at a highfalutin party. Each tRNA matches its own specific codon on the mRNA, kinda like findin' your partner for a square dance. They line up one by one in the proper sequence, harder than hoeing a long row in mid-July heat. Finally, once all the right partners are found (I reckon it's the right sequence of amino acids), they're linked together to form a protein - as satisfying as grandma's chicken and dumplings at the end of a hard day's work.	38ecea52234ab4bc11e7b2b2ef75d4ea	-1	-1

The second step, known as translation, starts when tRNA reads and deciphers the mRNA code in a manner similar to builders interpreting blueprints. The third step is the addition of amino acids by tRNA, comparable to builders adding bricks and materials according to instructions. Lastly, after constructing a chain of amino acids, it folds into a functional protein - much like building components coming together to form a finished structure.	e8de0aff05aaae5a92e094cb00845811	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a complex production line, where the mRNA blueprint, having exited the nucleus (akin to a master architect's office), firstly undergoes translation at the ribosome (the factory floor) where its code is read and assembled into amino acid chains. These chains then fold into specific three-dimensional structures (like origami masters crafting intricate designs), creating functional proteins which are finally transported to their destination within or outside the cell (much like a flawless logistics operation).	1b1416ca1a37ee595bdb88917b69d5a3	-1	-1
5	Alright, kid, so imagine this whole thing like the Sox game down at Fenway. First off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus like a rookie sprinting from the dugout to first base, that's transcription for ya. Then it slides into the ribosome like it's slidin' into second base, where translation happens - this is when the mRNA sequence gets read and turned into an amino acid sequence, kinda like how the coach reads signals to the batter. This sequence is then folded up tighter than a North End cannoli into a protein - that's your protein folding. Finally, just like delivering that home run ball to an eager fan, the protein gets transported to wherever it’s needed in the cell—call this protein targeting. There ya have it!	bdcbdd625091d050e75b26dab519a145	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Just like a taxi navigating from Soweto to Joburg CBD, protein synthesis is a journey with a couple of pit stops. First, the mRNA, carrying the blueprint from the nucleus, hits the road like a bakkie on the N1, heading straight for the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. This is our first stop, translation, where the ribosomes are like our spaza shops, reading the mRNA message and building the protein small-small. Next up is tRNA coming into play, it's like the boerewors to our braai, bringing specific amino acids to add to the protein chain. Lastly, once our 'boerie roll' of a protein is complete, it either gets shipped out of the cell or stays in-house, depending on its function. So you see mate, it's as clear as a Jo'burg morning that protein synthesis is quite a trip!	9aff1af85f74500a60be72c9662cae0a	-1	-1
5	Alright, so imagine protein synthesis as a cross-Canada road trip. Starting in the nucleus, which we'll compare to Toronto, the mRNA, or our highway map, leaves and heads towards the ribosomes, or as we will refer to them - the Calgary Stampede. Here's where things get as busy as rush hour on Highway 401. The tRNA, behaving like food trucks at the Stampede, delivers amino acids based on the mRNA map. Then, these amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, a process that's as tight-knit as a beaver's dam, to form a protein. Lastly, the protein is folded into its final functional structure, a process just as swift and critical as a swift eastward wind blowing us home to Newfoundland. So there you have it - a journey from Toronto to Newfoundland with some pit stops along the way!	f9cf1452f0a0d0bd315e7be87c106ee5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, could be likened to a grand theatrical production. The mRNA, like a script fresh from the playwright (the nucleus), departs for the ribosome, the stage where the performance (translation) begins; tRNA, akin to actors interpreting their lines, decodes the mRNA's instructions and brings in the appropriate amino acids (costumes); these are then strung together into a polypeptide chain, much like scenes forming an act; finally, post-translation modifications occur, comparable to final rehearsals and touch-ups before the protein's 'debut'.	818907c6486eaed9591c299d8cd42ce2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a mair complex process than ye might think, akin tae the craftin' o' a fine Scotch whisky. First, mRNA bides its time in the nucleus afore it gets the green light tae leave, much like a distiller waitin' for the richt moment tae start the process. It then scurries aff tae the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, just as our distiller moves tae his stills. Here, it's translated intae a protein in a process known as translation - this is like transformin' barley, water an' yeast intae a rich, amber spirit. The new proteins are then folded intae their correct shapes by chaperone proteins, much like the whisky is aged and matures in oak casks. Finally, these proteins are either used in the cell or shipped oot; much like how our finished whisky is either savoured by the distiller or sent aff tae be enjoyed by others.	71480d49498873e1a067fda53c2deab9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process similar to cooking, where the recipe (mRNA) leaves the cookbook holder (nucleus) and enters the kitchen (cytoplasm). There, ingredients (amino acids) are gathered by the chef (ribosome), followed by the recipe instructions being translated into sequence of ingredients (tRNA's role in translation), leading to the creation of a dish (protein); finally, it is served after appropriate garnishing and presentation (protein folding and post-translational modifications).	230fe9ad2cd882a8c47e5b8f0133a89d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, once mRNA departs the nucleus, can be likened to a grand theatrical production with four major acts. Act one is the 'Transcription' where the mRNA script is meticulously crafted inside the nucleus, Act two titled 'Translation', sees this script being deciphered by the ribosome stage manager into a precise amino acid sequence. In the third act labelled 'Elongation', these sequences are strung together like costume beads in a continually growing polypeptide chain. The final act, 'Termination', marks the end of the play when the completed protein is released, ready to perform its designated role within the cellular cast.	07e44a6846a7a1effcb4301cd38fea91	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to a well-orchestrated production in a factory. The mRNA, acting as a blueprint, exits the nucleus (akin to the head office) and travels to the ribosome (the factory floor), where it is read and translated into amino acids (building blocks) during the process of translation; these amino acids are then systematically assembled into proteins (finished products) through peptide bond formation, with the entire process regulated and facilitated by various enzymes and molecules (like diligent factory workers).	0517bdc91869da183c358da394690976	-1	-1
5	In the dance of protein synthesis, mRNA bolts out from the nucleus, quick as a hare in a meadow, holding the choreography for the upcoming performance. Next, mRNA waltzes with ribosomes in the cytoplasm - they're as solid as the Rock of Cashel, reading and translating the dance steps. Then, tRNA, the old hand who's been at this game for donkey's years, brings along amino acids that string together like dancers in a line. Lastly, the polypeptide chain folds faster than greased lightning into a protein, ready to take center stage in the cell's functions.	2dbfa7b3a93f8d7563b3641389b7184d	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, this is like a four-step dance in a honky-tonk. First up, mRNA scoots out of the nucleus faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, that's transcription. Like finding a needle in a haystack, it then locates the ribosomes and gets stuck into translation. Then we’re on to elongation, with amino acids joining faster'n two peas in a pod. The last holler is termination, ending the whole shebang as smooth as a gravy sandwich.	aacdf5f36d72ba82c44471b9d56de121	-1	-1
5	1. Transcript Journey: mRNA, like a coded message, leaves the nucleus carrying genetic information. 2. Ribosome Reading: At the ribosomes -the factory floor- mRNA's code is read, much like one would follow a recipe. 3. tRNA Matching: tRNA enters the scene as a diligent courier, delivering specific amino acids that match the mRNA code. 4. Protein Formation: The amino acids link together in a chain like a pearl necklace, forming the protein.	27fe4fe50f9e52bc99041f8a47ab662b	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, involves four major steps:  1. Transcription: Just like a scribe copying a manuscript, this is where the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus. 2. mRNA Processing: This step can be compared to editing a draft; it involves modifications such as adding a cap and tail to the mRNA for protection and removing non-coding regions (introns) while joining coding regions (exons) together. 3. Translation: Here, the mRNA acts as a blueprint for building proteins (like instructions for assembling a LEGO model) in the cytoplasm, specifically on the ribosomes. 4. Protein Folding: Lastly, just like folding a paper airplane into its final shape, each new protein folds into its unique shape, which determines its function in the body.	5fa95f45cc32f0ac7089e8cf6bb61d6a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA move from nucleus like a message in bottle, it carries instruction. 2. Ribosome read this instruction on mRNA, like a worker reading blueprint. 3. tRNA brings amino acids, it's like delivery truck with building blocks. 4. Amino acids link to make protein, like bricks joining to form house.	fdc007e7f2b8b408a58397ebf3ae0352	-1	-1
5	Well, you betcha, protein synthesis is a journey. First off, it starts with mRNA leavin' the nucleus, kinda like a farmhand headin' off to the field. Then there's translation initiation where ribosomes latch onto the mRNA like a hound on a bone. Next up is elongation and this is when tRNA adds on amino acids, sorta like addin' cars to a train. Lastly, we got termination that's when everything stops and the protein is released, just like punchin' out after a long day's work.	7e14bfe989226b56c1af35a2662da276	-1	-1
5	Right, so imagine mRNA like the postie leaving the house (nucleus) with a special message. Firstly, it takes a wee trip to the ribosome - that's like the local pub where all the action happens. There, tRNA rocks up, acting like a proper translator converting the message into amino acids, sort of like deciphering secret code at a spy meet-up. These amino acids then string themselves together in a specific order to form a protein -- think of it like folks lining up for a ceilidh dance. Lastly, this new protein goes through some changes, kinda like getting spruced up before hitting the town, to make sure it's ready for its function in the cell.	1e5c3e1fdabeff40ec4ca64e680e3b98	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm can be compared to a coded message being dispatched from the control centre to the factory floor. 2. The process of translation, where the mRNA code is deciphered into amino acids by ribosomes, is like reading and following a recipe. 3. In tRNA carrying specific amino acids to the ribosome, it's akin to delivery trucks bringing the necessary ingredients based on the recipe. 4. Lastly, the creation of a protein through linking the amino acids together by peptide bonds in ribosomes is like a chef combining and cooking the ingredients to create a delicious dish.	76f97884122ad870b03afcfa8bb8958c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a recipe. Here are the four major steps: 1. mRNA Departure (Recipe Collection): The mRNA (like our recipe) leaves the nucleus with the information about the protein that needs to be synthesized. 2. Ribosome Binding (Gathering Ingredients): This 'recipe' binds to the ribosome, which is like our kitchen where all the ingredients for the protein will be gathered. 3. tRNA Attachment (Chef in Action): Next, tRNA (our chef) reads the 'recipe' and adds the appropriate amino acids (ingredients) together in a specific order. 4. Protein Release (Serving the Dish): Finally, when the 'recipe' has been fully read and all 'ingredients' have been added, our protein is released - just like serving a cooked dish.  So, in essence, protein synthesis is akin to cooking a meal following a specific recipe!	48a71bb12fa8d6657768cd0a64ab8367	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus: Think of mRNA as a coded letter, carrying the instructions written by the DNA (the boss) and leaving the office (the nucleus) to head to the factory (the ribosome). 2. Translation initiation: The ribosome, acting like a production manager, reads the mRNA letter and gathers the necessary components, namely transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are like delivery trucks loaded with specific amino acids. 3. Elongation: In this phase, the ribosome functions like an assembly line, reading each code on the mRNA and adding the corresponding amino acid from the tRNA to the protein chain being constructed. 4. Termination: Once the full set of instructions is read, just like reaching the end of a book, the finished protein is released from the ribosome. Like a finalized product leaving a factory line, ready for use or further modification elsewhere in the cell.	f4a29c5f25ba34fd66cea4fba0a67650	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a meticulously planned theatrical production. mRNA's exit from the nucleus is similar to an actor receiving their script and stepping onto the stage, while translation at the ribosome (the protein factory) resembles the actor delivering their lines under directorial guidance, transforming the written words into meaningful performance. The folding of the protein into its functional form is like the conclusion of the play, where all elements come together to create a coherent story. Lastly, post-translational modifications are akin to final adjustments made by the crew after rehearsals - refining costumes, adjusting lighting or sound - ensuring that every detail of the production is perfect for opening night.	9955768f83ad1dd8eb2d736ed1180699	-1	-1
5	Awright, kid. So picture it like this: mRNA's the Sox game ticket that just slipped out from the Fenway of the nucleus, right? Then there's four big innings here. First, ya got your Translation initiation - it's like they're callin' up the players to the plate. Second, you've got Elongation - imagine it like a wicked good batting streak, each hit adds up. Third? Termination - that’s when the ump calls the last out.

First stop, mRNA joins with a ribosome in the cytoplasm - that's our pit stop at Beaufort West. Second, tRNA comes along bringing amino acids, the building blocks, just like bringing boerewors for a braai. Thirdly, the ribosome attaches these amino acids together in a chain, just like how we'd string together wors on a skewer. Lastly, once the protein chain is ready, it folds into a specific shape for its function - much like how you'd fold your Springbok jersey after it's been washed and dried. It's quite a journey, but every step is crucial!	648b0ff0e776f73fbd864981af7d9389	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh! So starting our journey from the nucleus, the mRNA is like a blueprint on a freshly cut piece of lumber, carrying the plans to the construction site which is the ribosome. Then we get into translation, as tight as a beaver's dam, where tRNA brings in amino acids - they’re the eager beavers, decoding the mRNA message to build our protein. It’s solid as Canadian Shield that these amino acids form a long chain, creating a polypeptide. Lastly, just as steady as a Canuck's resolve facing winter, this chain folds into a unique shape to become a functioning protein.	37c3871eea5d4478ee8c86739e1fcdcc	-1	-1

Finally, the ribosome links these amino acids together to form a protein - as tight as a beaver's dam - and that's your game-winning goal!	e3dc04e0dbfe64b803ec5dfa0fd61bc1	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's imagine protein synthesis as a grand theater production. First, the mRNA, our script, leaves from the nucleus, the playwright's desk, carrying the coded message for the next performance. This leads us to the four pivotal acts of this play:   1. Transcription: Like transcribing the playwright's original script, DNA within the nucleus is rewritten into mRNA.     2. mRNA Processing: The initial script (mRNA) undergoes editing; unnecessary scenes (introns) are cut out and important scenes (exons) are spliced together to form a coherent play.     3. Translation: mRNA leaves the nucleus and arrives at the ribosome, or our theatre stage, where it is read by rRNA and tRNA - our actors – in a process called translation.      4. Protein Folding: Lastly, once all dialogue lines (amino acids) are connected in a sequence, they fold into complex structures like an unfolding drama on stage, creating this magnificent performance we call a protein!	d509a2ba5f6d3f63d0f00a30bd2596a4	-1	-1
5	Awright, here's hoo it gaes. First aff, mRNA bails oot o' the nucleus, richt, kindae like a wee lad breakin' free fae school when the bell rings. Next up, mRNA hits the ribosome whaur it's read like a guid buik at a story session, translatin' codons intae amino acids. This process is much akin tae readin' a recipe and gatherin' aw the ingredients ye need. It's here that tRNA steps in, deliverin' these amino acids to the ribosome on its back, a bit like a postie on his rounds. Finally, these amino acids are strung thigither tae mak a protein, sortae like threadin' beads onto a string tae mak a bonnie necklace.	d0c959f796f41d0b68e5e78b610cd728	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-organized factory production line, where mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the blueprint sent from the design department. This blueprint (mRNA) then heads for the 'workshop', or ribosome, to kickstart translation where tRNA molecules play the part of diligent workers, carefully matching each amino acid with its corresponding codon in the mRNA (a process similar to assembling pieces according to the blueprint). Once assembled, these amino acids form a polypeptide chain, like a freshly produced product coming out of the assembly line. Lastly, the 'finished product' (protein) undergoes folding and processing in the Golgi apparatus, serving as the factory's quality control before it's ready for use.	f7e89c5f700e72134589afa3b9151c1a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, like a well-rehearsed play, begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, acting as the script that holds the detailed instructions.

5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a brilliant stage play! The mRNA, or 'script', is transported from the 'director' (nucleus) to the 'actors' (ribosomes), where it's read and translated into 'character roles' (amino acids) by the help of 'co-actors' (tRNA). These amino acids then dance together in a well-coordinated ballet, forming a complex ensemble known as a protein!	9fccb984741ea086edf4701f6d822c95	-1	-1
5	Well now, the whole process is a bit like a relay race! First up, our mRNA sprints out of the nucleus carrying the exact code to build a protein, that's as precious as hen's teeth. Next, it hands the baton over to the ribosome in the cytoplasm; this lad acts like a master builder following an architect's plan. Then it's time for our transfer RNA to join the fray, bringing along amino acids that are puck into place like stones in a wall by the ribosome based on the mRNA code. Finally, once our new protein chain is built and folded properly, it heads off on the never never to perform its vital job within or outside of the cell.	5fb9331b39e6b8420345f5068ac6e163	-1	-1

This is where our meal prep starts - we whip up the amino acids in the exact order as per the mRNA message, just like how you'd chop and blend ingredients for your stew. The ribosome makes sure the amino acids are strung together right, just like makin' sure your biscuits rise well in the oven. Lastly, when our protein chain is all cooked up and ready, it has to fold on up into its final form - kinda like how that apple pie comes outta the oven perfectly golden and delicious!	56cf93f2c018b262bc26b442d3888dd7	-1	-1

Elongation: With the start signal given, tRNA molecules - acting like workers carrying different parts - bring corresponding amino acids to match each codon on the mRNA, forming a growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: When the ribosome reaches a 'stop' codon on mRNA, much like reaching the end of the assembly instructions, it releases both the mRNA and new protein molecule. Now, this protein can undergo further modifications before it's fully functional, similar to post-production checks and quality assurance in our factory analogy.	d6bfb3ece63f079aa4ad7c173f9b218b	-1	-1

Next, much like how a chef would decode and interpret his recipe, ribosomes within the cytoplasm interpret the mRNA's information to assemble amino acids in the correct order (step 2: translation). This is similar to beads on a string. Following this, similar to how a chef begins to combine and process his ingredients, these amino acids are then linked together to form polypeptides (step 3: elongation). Finally, just as a chef applies the finishing touches to his dish before it's served, these polypeptides fold into specific three-dimensional structures to become functional proteins (step 4: protein folding).	d98659a245a9e13e19d00851568efe65	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, akin to a masterful orchestra performance, commences when mRNA, much like the concert's music score, departs the nucleus. The first act is transcription; where DNA's information is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus, akin to a composer penning his symphony. mRNA then embarks on its journey to the cytoplasm, emblematic of the music score being delivered to the orchestra. During translation, the second phase, ribosomes (the orchestral conductor) read mRNA sequences and assemble amino acids (musicians) into proteins (the symphony), guided by tRNA (sheet music). Lastly, like fine-tuning the performance before the grand debut, post-translational modifications ensure the protein is correctly folded and functional.	5893efa22259af6aed1174004a8a7b72	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs, the process of protein synthesis is a fine jig and reel that starts with mRNA dashing out from the nucleus like a hare in a meadow. First off, there's transcription whirling away within the nucleus, where DNA is used as a template to create mRNA – it's pretty much like copying down your Mam's recipe for soda bread. This mRNA lad then has to exit the nucleus, just like heading out on the tear. Next up is translation, occurring in the cytoplasm, where mRNA is read by ribosomes just like love letters from home, resulting in specific amino acids being gathered – a bit like picking up your round at the pub. Finally, these amino acids are linked together to form a brand new protein, sort of like stringing together words in a story or pearls on a necklace. So there you have it, protein synthesis makes proteins - the stuff we're made of -  as sure as God made little apples!	3f291831abefe43668f35fbf2350bd2f	-1	-1
5	Well, alrighty then. You see, protein synthesis is sorta like a cook whippin' up a batch of biscuits from a recipe.  1. First off, mRNA (which is like the recipe) leaves the nucleus (the recipe box).  2. Then it hitches a ride to the ribosomes (kinda like our kitchen), which is where all the action happens. 3. The ribosome reads that mRNA just like you would read your grandma's biscuit recipe, and this part we call translation. 4. Lastly, with that recipe in hand, the ribosome starts grabbin' amino acids (the ingredients for our biscuits) and hooks 'em together to create a protein (our finished plate of biscuits).  So, it might seem complicated at first, but really it's not much different than bakin' a batch of biscuits on Sunday mornin'.	7b377ec6c18d9a124e5259ff591a3ef0	-1	-1

Amino Acid Linkage: This stage is like building a train, where each carriage (amino acid) is linked together by peptide bonds in the order specified by the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, like origami art, the long chain of amino acids folds itself into a specific 3D shape, creating the final protein structure.	d927f11b1ecc54d637629c5629b88420	-1	-1
5	Alright, mi can give yuh dis in a style you might understand. The mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the master blueprint coming out from a secure vault. First step, it heads to the ribosome, the workshop of the cell, that's Transcription. Then comes Translation, where tRNA, think about them as workers, read the blueprint and gather amino acids, the building blocks. Next up is Elongation, this be like the assembly line where amino acids are linked together following the blueprint to create a protein chain. Finally, Termination, it's like when the final product is ready and comes off the assembly line.

5	Protein synthesis is akin to a finely orchestrated symphony, where mRNA plays the role of the conductor who leaves the nucleus and dictates the script to the ribosome, or the orchestra. The first movement is transcription, where DNA's coded message is transcribed into mRNA within the nucleus; it then steps out into cytoplasm for translation in the second movement, where tRNA or the musicians interpret this code to add appropriate amino acids in sequence. In subsequent movements, these amino acids undergo peptide bonding to form polypeptides, and in the grand finale these polypeptides fold into a specific structure forming a protein, thus completing our symphony of life.	a6933bf686595bfb9ceb6e88a8671f38	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA slipping out of the nucleus, similar to a secret message leaving a fortress.

Step 2, you've got the tRNA coming in like hen's teeth, scarce as they are precious, bringing along the various ingredients (amino acids) to match the lad's recipe. Now for step 3, these ingredients get linked together in a specific order - this part is called elongation, and it's not unlike creating a proper stew.

Protein Formation: These amino acids are then linked together like building blocks to create a protein, concluding the process of protein synthesis just as building a house concludes with a final structure.	d6776604fca0f7f14f13fe3b664013ae	-1	-1
5	Okay, let's use a dance party as the analogy. First step be like when de mRNA leaves de nucleus, dat's like de invitation to de party getting passed out. Second step, is the process of translation; dat be like de DJ (the ribosome) reading de song request (the mRNA sequence). Thirdly, we have tRNA bringing in amino acids, just like guests bringing their own drinks to de party. Last step be de formation of a protein, like when everybody starts dancing together on de beat, creating a vibe or energy — that's the protein being formed.	e60c5d4301c705aaaeb1e9883519253b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Export: The process of protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus, which is like an instructional manual leaving the control room. 2. Translation Initiation: As mRNA reaches the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, it's akin to a tape being inserted into a player, ready for decoding. 3. Elongation: The ribosome then moves along the mRNA like a reading lens scanning through text, translating codons into amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Termination and Release: Finally, when the ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA, this marks the end of translation similar to reaching the end of a book, resulting in the release of the newly synthesized protein.	632478fcac0f1ebc184931814a4e6597	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transportation: As a messenger, mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic recipes to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, like a postman delivering mail. 2. Translation Initiation: Ribosome reads the mRNA's message much like a scanner reading a barcode. This starts process of protein synthesis. 3. Elongation: tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, which are added to growing protein chain similar to bricks being added to a building construction. 4. Termination: Once the entire mRNA message has been read (like reaching end of a book), protein synthesis stops and new protein is released.	cb8c9c4813634f00fc230c4726871454	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's the skinny. Picture protein synthesis kinda like a good ol' Midwestern potluck dinner. First off, mRNA gets outta the nucleus just about as quick as squirrels in a cornfield -- that's your transcription process. Next, mRNA pulls up a seat at the ribosome table, where it brings out a recipe for a specific protein -- this here is translation. Then, tRNA comes over with its plate (amino acid) to fill up based on the mRNA's recipe -- that'd be amino acid attachment. Finally, all those plates get lined up to make one great big protein dish -- peptide bond formation! So, there ya have it, the potluck of protein synthesis!	fdf8d0b1c41e6c3217a818ebc29dc9bc	-1	-1
5	Awrite, so imagine protein synthesis as a weaver's loom. First up, mRNA hops it oot the nucleus like a hasty rabbit, carrying the genetic blueprint like a secret message. Next, it links up wi' ribosome in the cytoplasm, this is like the meeting place where our plan starts to come together. The tRNA then steps up to the plate, acting as both translator and delivery driver, bringing specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA’s instructions - it's like it's reading a detailed shopping list. Lastly, these amino acids are stitched together like a finely crafted tartan kilt, creating the protein that our body needs. So, from start to finish, it's like a well-orchestrated Highland dance!	c46cfe67425fa0ed57bb271e8ee95f9f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to crafting a recipe from a cookbook, where mRNA is the recipe, the Ribosome is the chef, tRNA are the ingredients, and protein is the final dish. The four steps include: (1) mRNA exiting the nucleus like a chef carrying an important recipe out of a library; (2) initiation, where ribosomes read the mRNA much like a chef reads a recipe; (3) elongation, where tRNA brings in amino acids similar to ingredients being added to a cooking pot; and finally, (4) termination, where the end of the mRNA sequence signals that our culinary masterpiece - the protein - is complete.	754cf16ecc76da4ef3192c0da967e78e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA departure from the nucleus, can be compared to constructing a building. The mRNA is like the architect's blueprint leaving their office (nucleus), being read and interpreted by ribosomes (construction workers) in a process called translation, the tRNA acts like trucks delivering specific amino acids (building materials), and finally these amino acids are linked together through peptide bonds (constructed into rooms or levels of the building) forming a polypeptide chain, which, after folding into its functional form, becomes the finished protein - a complete building.	c3026304b812cdeee083bb7baafa0d3d	-1	-1
5	Sure, to understand the process of protein synthesis, we can think of it as a complex cooking recipe.  1. mRNA Exits the Nucleus: This is like the chef (mRNA) leaving the recipe box (nucleus) with a specific recipe (genetic information). 2. Translation Initiation: This would be akin to the chef reading through the recipe and gathering all necessary ingredients, which in this case are the ribosomes and tRNA molecules. 3. Elongation: This step is like the chef actually following through with cooking instructions, where each tRNA adds an amino acid (or ingredient) to the polypeptide chain (or dish). 4. Termination: Finally, it's when the chef finishes making the dish, which is analogous to the completion of a protein when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA molecule.	467569123bb031001dd1f65d5dd48b5c	-1	-1
5	Certainly, protein synthesis is a process much akin to the assembly line of a factory, with each step adding a critical component to the final product. First, mRNA is like the blueprint leaving the supervisor's office (nucleus), then it goes to the ribosome (the factory floor) where tRNA (workers) follow its instructions in a process called translation, picking up specific amino acids (raw materials) and linking them into polypeptides (unfinished products). These polypeptide chains then fold into 3-dimensional structures (finished goods) during post-translational processing and are delivered to their designated places within or outside the cell (distribution and sales).	bc9ee21f51923b169438669aa8cc418d	-1	-1
5	Alroit, so pictuah it like dis – Fuhst off, ya got the mRNA scootin' outta the nucleus fastah than a Sox fan aftah a Yankees game. Its first stop is our ol' buddy the ribosome, which reads it like the mornin' Herald and starts stringin' togethah amino acids into a polypeptide chain - kinda like how ya mom strings togethah those wicked lobstah beads for the summah shack. Then this polypeptide needs some foldin', just like Tommy down at Sullivan's has to fold his pizza slice before takin' a bite. That’s wheah chaperone proteins step in, makin' suah everythin's hunky-dory an’ lookin’ more structurally complex than the Zakim Bridge at rush hour. Last up, you got post-translational modifications. This is where the protein gets decked out with all sorts of trimmin’s - phosphates, carbohydrates, you name it - kinda like how we dress up Fenway Park for opening day. An' voila! You've got yourself a fully synthesized protein, ready to work hardah than a Southie longshoreman unloadin' cargo off a freighter.	4f0c85086b2e8e8e0e4a7dd7b19d2e9a	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here we go. Think of protein synthesis as a lekker braai. First up, mRNA exits the nucleus like your mate dashing off to buy more charcoal. This chap's got the recipe (known as the genetic code) for the protein to be made. Next, we've got transcription where the DNA is read and an mRNA copy is made, just like your pal reading out the boerewors recipe over the phone. Then there’s translation - this is like firing up that braai, with ribosomes reading the mRNA and tRNA bringing the correct amino acids, essentially the boerewors ingredients. Lastly, these amino acids join together to form a long chain, similar to how your wors ends up on a roll - voila! You’ve got your protein ready for use in the body, or in our case, a delicious wors roll.	2c63f520cd4b725effe7baf2f0b2b6b9	-1	-1
5	Sure, I would be happy to explain in a metaphorical way.  1. mRNA leaving the nucleus: Like a letter carrier braving a Maritime snowstorm, mRNA leaves the protected nucleus carrying vital information for protein-building instructions.   2. Translation: Once mRNA arrives at the ribosome -- think of it as the busy mail sorting center -- the process of translation occurs. This is like decoding a secret message, where the codons (or words) in the mRNA sequence are translated into amino acids. 3. Elongation: Just as steady as a Canuck's resolve, the polypeptide chain keeps elongating one amino acid at a time, matching each new mRNA codon that arrives with the appropriate tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid. 4. Termination and release: Finally, like spring thawing out the solid Canadian Shield, termination ends translation and releases the completed protein chain, ready to carry on its various tasks in the body.	dd25a21acd922d3d85f35c9893a3c978	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is like constructing a building based on a blueprint. The mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the foreman carrying the blueprint (instructions) to the construction site (ribosomes), where tRNA acts as builders that use specific bricks or materials (amino acids) to build the structure (the protein). Next, these amino acids get linked together in a specific sequence dictated by the blueprint, through a process termed as peptide bond formation. This translates into the growing polypeptide chain (the actual construction of the building). These chains fold into complex 3D shapes forming proteins (the final structure of the building), and are then transported by various cellular mechanisms to their respective locations for action.	55256f05d21d1bb0cd2cfd010368d3db	-1	-1
5	Awa we gang, liken it tae a letter leavin the hoose. First aff, mRNA birls oot the nucleus, carryin the instructions for makin protein - this is yer 'letter'. It then attaches til a ribosome in the cytoplasm - this is like it findin its richt bus. The wheen thing kicks off wi' th' process o' translation whaur tRNA molecules haul specific amino acids til the mRNA - ye could think o' them as delivery vans bringin the richt bits an' pieces. Lastly, these amino acids get strung thegither by the ribosome to form a protein - much akin to how a kid would string thegither beads to make a necklace.	c22a5522edb30681c5cc2d84d914c42b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Export: After the transcription process in the nucleus, the messenger RNA (mRNA), like a coded letter, exits the nucleus carrying genetic information to be decoded in the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Assembly: Ribosomes, acting as molecular factories, bind to the mRNA and translate the genetic information into a sequence of amino acids. 3. Elongation: Just like a string of pearls, amino acids are assembled in a sequence according to the mRNA code forming a polypeptide chain which is aided by transfer RNA (tRNA). 4. Protein Folding: The polypeptide chain folds itself into a specific 3D structure, similar to origami, creating the final protein that carries out various functions within the cell.	0b3cffac17d32d3142b96ed317984e30	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a highly sophisticated manufacturing process. Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus (comparable to blueprints leaving the design office), it travels to ribosomes located in the cytoplasm, which act like factory workers, translating the mRNA's instructions into amino acids (the building blocks). The polypeptide chain, a string of these amino acids, resembles a half-assembled product on a conveyor belt, which is then folded into a specific shape (like fitting pieces of a puzzle together) by chaperone proteins to form the final product - a functional protein.	ffdc9facb8c26ccdc9126f0752135527	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a meticulous construction project: 1) mRNA, the blueprint, exits the nucleus - the head office; 2) At the ribosome - the construction site, translation happens, where tRNA - the workers, decode mRNA's instructions into amino acids - the building blocks; 3) These amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain - the structure's frame; 4) The polypeptide chain then folds into a specific shape - akin to interior design, which determines the protein's function.	fcd65b79a883521a16ca35f93fc9565f	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes: Protein synthesis is a bit like a relay race. First off, mRNA bolts out of the nucleus like greased lightning, carrying the genetic information from DNA, almost as if it's clutching the baton. Then, mRNA scurries to the ribosome, the 'assembly line' where transfer RNA (tRNA) has been waiting donkey's years. The tRNA, a matchmaker of sorts, pairs up amino acids with the mRNA template - like finding dancing partners at a ceilidh. Last but not least, these amino acids are joined together in a long chain to form a protein. It's quare complex, but that's nature for ya!	999a578d4c65ec06309d8d1fb5f1c262	-1	-1
5	Well, let me tell y'all it's a bit like a relay race where the baton passes through several hands. First off, mRNA bolts from the nucleus like a jackrabbit after hearin' a hound dog. It races to the ribosome which is waitin' like a Sunday church goer. Now, the ribosome reads that mRNA like grandma reads her favorite Bible verse, turnin' it into a protein sequence. Then tRNA comes in playin' the mailman, deliverin' amino acids straight to the ribosome. Finally, these amino acids join up, hand in hand, creating proteins just as surely as biscuits join up with gravy.	3252cdcf419b1a2f3d61893d19f9a166	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus is like a letter leaving the post office, carrying genetic instructions.  2. Translation begins on the ribosome, akin to a factory assembling a product according to the given blueprint.  3. tRNA brings in amino acids, similar to delivery trucks supplying materials for the assembly line. 4. The amino acids bond and fold into a protein, like building blocks forming a complex structure according to the guide map.	2646b13a772602a982bb3e3dfad09111	-1	-1

Mi hope dat clear enough!	f69cad731aa9bd4485d5437e312efe0d	-1	-1
5	Sure!  1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus is like a traveler leaving home with a map, it carries genetic information that serves as an instruction manual for protein synthesis.   2. It then arrives at the ribosome, the factory for protein synthesis, where tRNA plays the role of diligent workers, each carrying specific amino acids. 3. This process is called translation, akin to deciphering a secret code, where mRNA's instructions are translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. 4. The final step is protein folding, much like origami, where this linear chain of amino acids folds into a unique shape that determines the protein's function in the body.	f0ca0bc03195f8a354be82e015f42088	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: Like a messenger carrying crucial news from the royal palace to the townspeople, the mRNA takes genetic instructions from the nucleus to cytoplasm.  2. Ribosome Binding: The ribosome, acting like an artisan, binds to the mRNA and reads its information to prepare for protein synthesis. 3. Translation: As if translating an intricate ancient script into a modern language, the ribosome decodes mRNA's information into amino acid sequences to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: Like a skilled sculptor giving form to a clay model, the polypeptide chain folds into a specific structure, becoming a functional protein guided by chaperone proteins. This is how our bodies construct the variety of proteins needed for life functions.	fc50f9f5b8ee79d9026220cc69f853af	-1	-1
5	You bet, here it goes. Imagine mRNA like your local mailman, first, he's gotta leave the post office, or in this case, the nucleus. Then you've got this process called translation where the ribosomes - think of 'em like little factories - read the mRNA and start buildin' proteins based on that information. It's a bit like followin' a recipe to make your favorite pie. For every 3 sections of the mRNA (these are called codons), the ribosome tacks on an amino acid - these are like the ingredients for your pie. Lastly, once the protein is built, it folds up into a specific shape so it can do its job, sorta like how a pie needs to be baked just right to taste good.	5c5bc4c21a1595a2f2a1b704f5362769	-1	-1
5	"Right, so imagine the mRNA as a postie leaving the nucleus or ""post office"" wi' an important message. The first crucial step is transcription where the DNA's message gets scribbled down into mRNA. Next, it's like this wee mRNA chap dashes out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, that's called mRNA processing. Thirdly, we've got translation, think of it as the cellular machines, known as ribosomes, readin' this mRNA message to make sure it makes sense. Lastly, they start buildin' the protein, just like brickies laying doon bricks to build a house, based on the instructions in the mRNA.

5	Sure, here's an analogy to describe the process of protein synthesis.  Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, this is like a manager leaving the main office with key instructions. The first step is transcription, where DNA unwinds and mRNA is created - like writing down a recipe from a cookbook. Then in translation, this 'recipe' (mRNA) reaches the ribosome (the kitchen), where it gets decoded into amino acids (ingredients). These amino acids are then assembled into a protein (a freshly baked cake), folded and shaped by the chaperone proteins (the experienced pastry chef). Finally, they're transported to their specific destinations in the cell (like delivering the cake to its intended party).	0771b5b57a73ec1d8041f3d4c73a6973	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be compared to a master chef following a recipe. The mRNA is like the recipe being brought out from the recipe box (nucleus), then it reaches the ribosome which is like the kitchen where the ingredients (amino acids) are assembled in the order specified by the recipe (mRNA sequence) to create a beautiful and functional dish (protein).	02ce0455c890fc4e8e34cd5da80e5690	-1	-1

Next, tRNA, acting as little delivery trucks, transfer appropriate amino acids to the ribosome based on the codon sequence of the mRNA. Finally, once the protein chain is complete, it undergoes folding and modification for its final 3D structure which is akin to a craftsman giving final shape and polish to his creation.	7f7a9867ccf24ce1a20f1e37aac059e3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, can be likened to a grand theatrical production. The mRNA's departure is akin to the script being handed over from the control room (nucleus) to actors (ribosomes), while amino acids play costume designers combining different outfits (tRNA molecules) to create various characters (proteins). Translation then represents the dress rehearsal where each character gets into their costumes (amino acids align according to codons), before the final unveiling on stage - protein folding and release depicts the performance going live for the audience (cell functionality).	51168f58bf832c6adcfb8c0fa2d28f3a	-1	-1

Amino Acids Join: Think of tRNA like your ouma joining the dots in one of her puzzle books; it brings the correct amino acids together based on the instructions from the mRNA and ribosome. 4. Polypeptide Chain Forms: Last step is as slow as a wet week but vital. It's like building a wall brick-by-brick where each brick is an amino acid joined together in long chains to form a protein.	c49f1f2a62db3231ce4d338c145d0471	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Starting with mRNA embarking on its journey from the nucleus is quite similar to a traveller setting off from their home base. The first stop, much like a layover at Toronto's bustling Pearson Airport, is the ribosome where Translation occurs; this is where mRNA's message gets decoded into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Secondly, akin to assembling a hockey team, these amino acids are linked together in a specific order to form a protein chain. This process, known as peptide bond formation, is like selecting the perfect team lineup at training camp.

The mRNA leaving the nucleus acts like the recipe being taken out of the recipe book (nucleus), and then it undergoes four major steps:  1. Transcription: It's like transcribing the recipe – the DNA's information gets copied into mRNA inside the nucleus. 2. mRNA Processing: It's equivalent to refining the recipe; unnecessary parts (introns) are removed, and only useful parts (exons) are left. 3. Translation: This is like interpreting the recipe – ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and assemble amino acids in the specific order to form a protein. 4. Protein Folding: It's akin to the final presentation of your dish – the chain of amino acids folds into a three-dimensional structure, making up a functional protein that can carry out its role in the cell.	be65c209f1e4eccf4ed2358e4ce343cf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is much like a well-rehearsed theatrical play. The mRNA, our script, exits the nucleus (the backstage area) and journeys to the ribosome (our stage), in the process known as transcription. Once it arrives, tRNA (actors) reads the mRNA sequence and matches it with corresponding amino acids (lines of the script) in a procedure called translation. These amino acids then link together in a chain to form a protein, comparable to actors delivering their lines to bring the story to life on stage, in a process called polypeptide chain formation. Finally, these proteins undergo modifications - like a dress rehearsal - in the post-translational modification step, ensuring they are perfectly ready for their role within the cell.	590302ad05d26365fecaeaffaea3fdd5	-1	-1

First stop for our lad is the ribosome, the town square where he meets his mates, the tRNA fellas carrying amino acids, they're as wet as an otter's pocket with information! Next up, these lads start building a chain, linking arm in arm in the right sequence - it's like a bang-on perfect dance routine! And just as quick as a fox, we've got ourselves a protein. Now remember, this process has been happening exactly the same way for donkey's years, isn't nature fascinating?	5589ed80a8992f985179c1589c0826cf	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it's a bit like this: first off, mRNA exits the nucleus, which is kinda like leaving home base. Then, it heads to the ribosome, where it's read like a recipe book during translation. Now this is where tRNA comes in, acting like the grocery shopper, pickin' up the right amino acids and bringing 'em back. Lastly, these amino acids are strung together to form a protein - think of it like building a LEGO set, piece by piece till you get your final model.	35eab7867a6e89ac1cc141070a707e67	-1	-1

Translation: tRNA molecules, similar to diligent workers, carry specific amino acids (building blocks) to the ribosome based on the codons in the mRNA. 4. Polypeptide formation: These amino acids are then linked together in a chain much like links in a necklace, forming a polypeptide that eventually folds into a functional protein.	c30feead45868fdda754afb759ca85d1	-1	-1

Third step now, you can think of it like building a fish trap, the rRNA ina di ribosome link up di amino acids following di mRNA instructions. Las' step is like when fisherman done set up he trap an ready fi sail home, the finished protein detaches itself from ribosome an start fi do its work ina di body.	739ba5b1350313e420c4b0eb30aa2b85	-1	-1

Termination and Protein Release: The end of protein synthesis is like the final whistle at the end of shift, when the protein is released and the machinery stops.	ac97b469b6e20714bc6e99be9ff29cf5	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, let's break this down like a four-course meal. First off, that mRNA gets itself outta the nucleus like a teenager sneaking out for a night of fun - this is called transcription. Next, it hitches a ride on a ribosome in the cytoplasm, just like catchin' a bus to the big city - we call this initiation. Then, it starts building an amino acid chain, pickin' up each one like you'd pick apples from a tree, which is the elongation phase. Finally, it stops when it hits a stop codon, sorta like hittin' the end of the line on a long road trip - we call that termination. In the end, you got yourself a brand new protein!	82f0e94168689111330e7180d774d10e	-1	-1
5	Awrite, imagine protein synthesis as a wee chip shop in the heart of Glasgow. The mRNA is like the chippy's order, it gets passed through the window (nuclear pore) and heads to the kitchen (cytoplasm). There, it meets up with the chef, the ribosome, who reads the order and starts cooking (translation). It grabs fresh ingredients (amino acids) delivered by the waitstaff (tRNA), making sure each ingredient matches perfectly with the order. Adding one ingredient at a time, we get our piping hot dish (a newly synthesized protein) ready for serving!	a4455deec9f97a8d87dd17d82ddf2caa	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like an encoded message leaving the command centre, mRNA, bearing genetic codes, leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Assembly: The mRNA then acts as a template at the ribosome (the protein factory), where tRNA molecules (the workers) arrive carrying specific amino acids. 3. Translation: This is like translating a foreign language into English, where each triplet codon on the mRNA corresponds to a specific amino acid brought by the tRNA. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Finally, these amino acids join together in a specific order, much like links in a chain, to form a polypeptide which folds into a protein.	9ed1251c98058e8f66bd7f87dbe38ce9	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Export: Like a secret message coming out of the control room, mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, exits the nucleus. 2. Translation Initiation: It's like starting a new project; the ribosome then binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) where it's ready to be translated into amino acids. 3. Elongation: This step is similar to building blocks; tRNA molecules bring in amino acids and attach them to the growing chain based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. 4. Termination: Finally, like clocking out at the end of a work day, when a stop codon is reached, the process ends and the newly formed protein is released for further processing and folding.	8954ffa9684a632dee42d4815a84ab6f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: The mRNA, like an important letter containing specific instructions, exits the nucleus to deliver its message. 2.

5	Protein synthesis is a biological process akin to a factory production line. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four major steps can be seen as: 1) mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm - this is like a blueprint being delivered from an architect's office to a construction site; 2) the ribosome reading the mRNA sequence - comparable to a foreman interpreting the blueprint; 3) tRNA bringing amino acids to the ribosome and matching them with the mRNA codons - this mirrors a worker fetching materials based on instructions; and 4) amino acids being linked into a polypeptide chain, creating a protein - this is analogous to workers assembling the building based on the blueprint.	f3c18d5e9a19d9d8dff38d8f4ebf2fc3	-1	-1
5	Alrite, heah's how it goes. First off, that mRNA beats it outta the nucleus, kinda like the Sox hittin' a home run outta Fenway. Then in the cytoplasm, ribosomes - they're wicked smaht by the way - latch onto it and start readin' it, slowah than molasses in January. Next up, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosomes, like loyal Pats fans tailgatin' with hot dogs and burgahs. Finally, these amino acids are strung together into a protein chain, tightah than a nor'easter packed with snowflakes.	3fb6526f835151089325ebde8aafa1ec	-1	-1
5	No problem, here goes... It's like a relay race. Starting off with the mRNA sprinting out of the nucleus like a greyhound after a bunny. The next step is quite the task, as difficult as trying to convince a lion to be a vegetarian! This involves a translator, the ribosome, taking the instructions from the mRNA and converting them into a language that tRNA can understand. Then comes the tRNA, it's got to be as precise as a meerkat on guard duty, picking up specific amino acids and bringing them back to the ribosome. Lastly, these amino acids are connected together by peptide bonds in the ribosome just like how braai meat gets threaded onto a skewer. This forms the protein, which can then go about its business in the cell.	bf39dfab07ab2f1233333bc392bbf52e	-1	-1
5	Just like a hockey player passes the puck from one teammate to another, mRNA leaving the nucleus starts the race in protein synthesis. It then works as steady as a Canuck's resolve to transcribe the sequence in the ribosomes (translation), where tRNA brings in amino acids, hot as Toronto in July, to form a budding protein structure. This is followed by protein folding, swift as a Calgary wind, creating a unique 3D shape crucial for its function. Finally, post-translational modifications ensure the protein is 'game-ready', like fine-tuning a goalie's pads before a big match.	50dafbb015c88f95b64f940c2b31984b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-orchestrated play where mRNA plays the part of the script, exiting the nucleus (the green room). The first act is transcription within the nucleus, where the mRNA script is created from DNA. In Act 2, mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome (stage), where translation, or reading of the script, occurs. In Act 3, tRNA (actors) brings in amino acids (props) according to the codons (lines) on the mRNA. Finally, in Act 4, these amino acids bond together, creating a protein (the final performance).	69622bd4444eec237fc92c1a5a194507	-1	-1
5	Fit a've tae tell ye aboot protein synthesis starts wi mRNA slippin' oot o’ the nucleus, a bit like a sly fox sneak-awa'. Then, it gets itsel' tae the ribosomes, as if it's gaun doon the local for a pint. Next, like a guid lass at her knittin', transfer RNA (tRNA) starts weavin' amino acids intae proteins. Finally, the newly minted protein goes aff like a wee lad on his first day at schuil, ready to perform its assigned tasks in the cell.	692aed763c9b60cf09794be6738d8c04	-1	-1
5	Sure, I can provide a concise answer with analytical syntax communication style: 1. mRNA Departure: Beginning akin to a coded message leaving the command center, the mRNA, containing genetic information, bids farewell to the nucleus. 2. Ribosome Welcome: It's then welcomed by ribosomes present in the cytoplasm or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which act like little factories on assembly line reading the mRNA's instructions. 3. tRNA Participation: The transfer RNA (tRNA), serving as delivery trucks, bring amino acids to these ribosomes where they are linked according to the order specified in mRNA. 4. Protein Formation: This process leads to creation of a polypeptide chain, comparable to building blocks being methodically placed together, ultimately folding into a functional protein representing the final product. This elaborate dance of molecules results in protein synthesis - a fundamental biological process that ensures life's continuity and diversity.	0749d684241cdc247daa743687fb8f76	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a factory production line. First, mRNA, like a dispatch order, leaves the nucleus carrying the blueprint of the protein to be synthesized; secondly, it reaches the ribosome (the 'workshop') in the cytoplasm; thirdly, tRNA, acting as delivery trucks, brings in specific amino acids (the 'building blocks') according to the mRNA blueprint; and finally, these amino acids are assembled in the correct sequence (the 'assembly line') by peptidyl transferase enzyme, creating the final product - a functional protein.	b92c8af7e9ccc541495f5ce1db6813b2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is a bit like a manufacturing process. Firstly, the mRNA, acting as the product blueprint, travels from the nucleus (the design office) into the cytoplasm (the factory floor). Next, at the ribosome (the assembly line), the mRNA code is read and translated by tRNA (the workers) during a step called translation. Each tRNA carries an amino acid (parts of the product) and pairs it to the mRNA, creating a chain of amino acids which becomes a polypeptide chain or protein (the final product). Lastly, these proteins are then folded and modified in the Golgi apparatus (the quality control department) to form a functional protein that performs various tasks within the cell.	58fe6771015964816f80543bae51b83e	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's the process of protein synthesis in four major steps. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus, making a beeline for the ribosomes like a sheep escaped from its pen. Once it's there, in what feels like donkey's years, tRNA comes along carrying amino acids; it’s like your reliable mate bringing a round of pints after work. Then they get together at the ribosome, which reads the mRNA and uses the tRNA to start knitting together these amino acids - a right fancy knot work that is. Last but not least, once this new protein has been crafted – on the never never mind you – it heads off to do its job in the cell, quare important work it is too!	11e14451205e6bd590b8b3353c002e3b	-1	-1
5	"Well, butter my biscuit, you've asked a good one there! Picture this: mRNA's like the mama bird flyin' outta its nest (the nucleus), then it gets itself a makeover during ""Translation"" to become the rough and ready blueprint. Next, we got ""Elongation,"" where the ribosomes take a gander at that blueprint and start stitchin' together amino acids like grandma sewin' a quilt on a Sunday afternoon. Then comes ""Termination,"" where it's 'last call' for adding them amino acids and our protein is as done as a fried catfish dinner. Lastly, in the ""Folding/Post-Translational Modification"" step, the protein gets tweaked and folded up tighter than a balled-up pair of socks so it can do its job just right."	90b992231ec1456d1b6b63cc1d430d83	-1	-1
5	Sure. The exciting journey of protein synthesis is much like baking a cake! First, the 'recipe' (mRNA) leaves the library (nucleus).

Next up, we've got translation where mRNA meets up wi' a ribosome; they're like best pals catching up at the local pub. During this meet-up, tRNA comes into play - think of them as those eejits who interrupt your chat to deliver pints, but in this case they're bringing amino acids.

Termination: Finally, envision the process ending like a full stop in a sentence – when a stop codon is reached, protein synthesis halts and the newly formed protein is released.	a14ddb21a1d41999871e334f8a207a84	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like baking a cake. The mRNA (recipe) leaves the nucleus (recipe book), moves to the ribosome (baker) where transfer RNA (ingredients) attach matching amino acids (cake components). These join in a specific order (baking steps), creating a protein chain (finished cake).	2ae7fdffa4cfd94cf513c3314481229d	-1	-1
5	Well, first off ya got mRNA gettin' the heck outta the nucleus, kinda like a Sox fan leaving Yankee Stadium.  Next, it's off to the ribosome, which you could think of as Fenway Park - where the real action happens. Here, tRNA steps up to the plate, bringing along amino acids - those are your players. The third step is the protein synthesis itself. The mRNA and tRNA team up like Pedroia and Ortiz in their prime, forming chains of amino acids - that's your winning play right there. Last but not least, these long chains fold into complex shapes to form proteins. Kinda like how a long season folds into the playoff race. And that's it! Protein synthesis, Boston-style.	988c09461921d39077988e8d17d1a5f5	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes: 1. mRNA Departure: Like a minibus taxi leaving the rank, mRNA exits the nucleus carrying genetic information as its passengers. 2. Ribosome Hitch: mRNA hitches a ride on a ribosome, similar to how one catches a lift club to work. 3. tRNA Matching: It's like a potjie competition - each tRNA brings the right amino acid (ingredient) based on the mRNA code (recipe). 4. Polypeptide Formation: Amino acids are linked together in a chain, like a line of dancers doing the Sokkie, creating a polypeptide that eventually folds into a protein.	304988adfb850c2386cff421b9973710	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a hockey game. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus -- the locker room, carrying the coach's game strategy. It hits the ice (cytoplasm), where it meets the ribosome, the player who'll carry out the plan. The mRNA connects with a tRNA molecule, akin to passing the puck, carrying specific amino acids. These amino acids form a protein chain, scoring the goal of synthesis. Lastly, post-translational modifications are made – it’s like reviewing and adjusting tactics after the goal for improved performance.	a097ca815483b78822cbd7ebd2f0a08a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Export: Think of mRNA as a secret message that needs to be sneaked out of the nucleus, which is like a heavily guarded fortress. The message contains instructions for making proteins. 2. Translation Initiation: Now, imagine the ribosome as a deciphering machine located outside the fortress, it latches onto the mRNA ready to decode the secret message. 3. Elongation: As if stringing beads onto a necklace, the ribosome connects amino acids together based on the mRNA code forming a polypeptide chain, the precursor to the protein. 4. Termination and Release: The final phase is like hitting the 'stop' button on a music player; when the ribosome encounters a 'stop' codon in the mRNA sequence, it releases the newly formed protein completing the process.	38c45e94b2318652c8afce5f45acdc2b	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's a haunle steps for ye. First, mRNA hops oot the nucleus like a wee haggis fleein' a hot pan. Second, it goes to the ribosome, that's like the kitchen o' the cell where the magic happens. Third, tRNA brings in amino acids, think of them as ingredients for oor haggis. Fourth and lastly, these amino acids are stitched together by the ribosome, akin to how you'd stitch up the stomach of a haggis. This gives ye yer protein.	3129f0a000361e2b3b4d59900eab3566	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is the answer: 1. mRNA Departure: Imagine mRNA as a diplomat carrying important information from the nucleus (the government center) of the cell to the cytoplasm (the city). This process is called transcription where DNA's genetic info is converted into mRNA.     2. Ribosome Reading: Then, ribosomes (like factories) in the cytoplasm read this information. 3. tRNA Matching: Picture tRNA as trucks that carry specific amino acids (building blocks), matching them with the mRNA's instructions. This step is known as translation. 4. Protein Formation: Finally, these building blocks are linked together to form a protein, much like constructing a building according to blueprints.	3e3b27edc6b10bb671f2ea02292184d7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be compared to a finely tuned orchestra performance, where mRNA is the music score originating from the composer's studio, nucleus. The transcription process is like a copyist detailing this score, while translation in ribosomes–the musicians–interprets the notes into a melodious protein ensemble. Post-translation modifications are akin to final tuning and rehearsals, with chaperone proteins as conductors ensuring perfection before the protein's debut on the cellular stage.	0ee7cc15b87e7809a4899e58cf299626	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, following mRNA's departure from the nucleus, is akin to a factory production line.  1. **mRNA Export:** Like a blueprint leaving the design studio, mRNA exits the nucleus carrying vital instructions for protein synthesis. 2. **Ribosome Attachment:** This is comparable to a machinery reading the blueprint; the ribosome attaches to the mRNA and begins decoding its information. 3. **Translation:** Much like workers assembling a product, amino acids are joined together by tRNA in a sequence determined by the mRNA, forming a polypeptide chain. 4. **Protein Folding:** Finally, like quality control ensuring the final product is shaped correctly, the polypeptide chain folds into a specific shape to create a functional protein.	ea2d6f500cebc6d9424b332f75c706c3	-1	-1
5	First off, your mRNA shoots out of the nucleus, like a greyhound out of the traps. Then the ribosome latches on to it, acting like a nosy neighbour reading an overheard letter. The tRNA then leaps into action, playing matchmaker by pairing up with the appropriate amino acids. Finally, these amino acids chain together faster than you can down a pint at the local, forming the protein. That's protein synthesis for you, clear as a bell!	57c067b6237af9d694df16f5a1e91fa0	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin’ about protein synthesis. We got four big steps to this dance. First off, that mRNA fella leaves the nucleus and hitches a ride on a ribosome. This here's called initiation. Then, them tRNA molecules start bringin' in amino acids, like kids to a picnic. They match 'em up with codons on the mRNA, kinda like a square dance – each one knowin' its partner. This part's elongation. Keep this hoedown goin' till you hit a STOP codon on the mRNA, tellin' everyone it's time to pack up and head home. That's termination. Lastly, these newfangled proteins need foldin' into shape before they're ready to work, like puttin' on Sunday best for church, we call it folding and post-translation. Ain't nothin' slower than molasses about this process though, it's zippy as all get out!	a936407c36e434d77a99b1fd5701ac34	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then encountering a ribosome where translation commences. The process of elongation continues as amino acids are linked based on the mRNA sequence until a stop codon is identified, at which point the formation of the protein molecule is terminated.	db009c5d79e6cbc929daa2d65ab022cf	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA journey from nucleus go to ribosome; that place where all action happen. Two, the tRNA come in carrying him amino acid and match up with the right codon pon di mRNA. Three, the amino acids weh deh pon one end of the tRNA bond up with the next one from adjacent tRNA. Four, this linking of amino acids keep going till a STOP codon show up pon di mRNA (that part them call elongation and termination).	3ab1a55f9fa124cc1efddf6e000517cb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA molecule exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome, where its sequence of bases, or codons, are read by rRNA. The process continues with the formation of an amino acid chain via tRNA molecules during elongation, finally reaching termination when a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site.	b32d02cbe609a6513211bd1b913bc3af	-1	-1
5	First step in protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next major step involves initiation where a START codon in the P site links together amino acids to initiate the formation of a protein chain.	22832cb0ca4d9f566e6a0f2a7d2430d3	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here it goes: So first off, that mRNA has to skedaddle out of the nucleus through this little gateway called a nuclear pore. Then, quicker than a jackrabbit on a date, it moves all the way through the cytoplasm till it finds itself a ribosome or maybe even heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	889600a09276781c6e224b2eb6d3436e	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA bails from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it kicks off protein synthesis at the ribosome where a START codon in the P site signals the start of the show. Then, amino acids get strung together like beads on a necklace to make up your protein.	087bfd85166dcebece67bea0fbf77619	-1	-1
5	Following its synthesis, mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore in a process known as RNA export. The protein synthesis proceeds via the translation process where amino acids are continually bonded together until a STOP codon is recognised on the mRNA within the A site, marking the end of elongation and signifying termination.	aab50d030e832e8959b9fd326af1ce2a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis consists of four major steps, beginning with the exit of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus. The first step is transcription, where a mRNA molecule is synthesized based on the DNA template inside the nucleus, then it leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. The next step is translation initiation, in which the mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome (rRNA) and is read in triplets called codons. The third step is elongation, where transfer RNA (tRNA) carries and adds new corresponding amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain based on the codon it reads on the mRNA. Lastly, during termination, the protein synthesis halts when a stop codon is encountered, leading to the release of the completed protein molecule for further processing and folding.	3cb9c00eccf4d6e2532f3f5632ceca27	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when the mRNA, migrated through the nuclear pore from the nucleus, is interpreted by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in triplets, termed codons. This mechanism allows for the assemblage of specific amino acid sequences integral to protein formulation.	6d49252843d26106818bd5bd4ec58611	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA's egress from the nucleus, subsequently associating with a ribosome where codons are read and translated to amino acids via transfer RNA (tRNA). The process of elongation persists as new amino acids are sequentially incorporated, guided by corresponding tRNA, until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the termination of protein synthesis.	5cfac5d906b672b8a981b8fe091ee327	-1	-1
5	Awright, so first things first, that mRNA's gotta make an exit from the nucleus, right? It moves on out through this little thing we call a nuclear pore. Now once it's out, it gets down to business - starts linking together these amino acids into a protein, kicking off with a START codon in something called the P site. That’s the initiation part of the whole shebang.	88252b49d050f6c523142db8dfb5571b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a journey as sure as a Jo'burg taxi during peak hour. Following this, we see tRNA's corresponding amino acids bonding with neighbouring ones, sticking together like Marmite on fresh roosterkoek.	2d35e8765bed8b6e981cc50e3c35f39f	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis involves: 1) mRNA's journey to a ribosome where it becomes the blueprint for creating a specific protein; 2) Transfer RNA (tRNA), loaded with relevant amino acids, recognizing and binding to the complementary codon sequence on the mRNA; 3) The ribosome facilitating the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, catalyzing the elongation process; and 4) The encounter of a STOP codon on the mRNA triggering termination, ending the amino acid linkage process and finalizing the synthesized protein. This whole process is as solid as Canadian Shield and done steady as a Canuck's resolve, but can be as twisted as Toronto's streets when you delve into its complexities.	f784c83f294e30e5b9de4933a689e02d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as the mRNA strand leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, proceeding to the ribosome where it's read in sets of three nucleotide bases or codons by rRNA. This translation process eventually leads to the formation of specific sequences of amino acids that fold into a functional protein molecule.	775f1749b5764119cd7ba7ecd5d5cc94	-1	-1
5	Furst up, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus an intae the cytoplasm, makin' its wye tae the ribosome or gallusin' intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, the matchin' amino acids oan the ither end o' the tRNA get bonded tae neighbourin' tRNA’s amino acids.	c72240f1b0a4a1831554fce2a57299c1	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it traverses the cytoplasm and finds its way to the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, in a process called translation, each codon on the mRNA pairs with a specific tRNA carrying its corresponding amino acid, which is then incrementally added to the growing protein chain.	60cedaa5439d8dfcdce058a7c32a1a40	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has been transcribed in the nucleus, it exits through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome for translation. At the ribosome, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each bearing an amino acid and an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon, facilitate the assembly of the polypeptide chain in a sequence dictated by the mRNA template.	c5b433ae4bcb66aa04cd6192568aacd7	-1	-1
5	Having exited the nucleus, the mRNA molecule traverses through the cytoplasm to locate either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the transfer RNA (tRNA), armed with the complementary anticodon, identifies and aligns with the matching codon on the mRNA.	d750854929be0956fed9efac794e102d	-1	-1
5	First up, mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus and lands smack bang on the ribosome, setting the stage for protein synthesis. From there, it's not as rare as hen's teeth to see tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognise the mRNA's codon. Following this, amino acids start to form a queue, kicking off with a START codon in the P site - they're linked together arseways to craft a protein.	7ad5df7aa85aeae2c29bbf442602aab3	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA has got to cut a rug outta the nucleus and head on over to a ribosome. Now, here's where it gets interesting. Our mRNA feller serves as a template for what we call the tRNA molecules (transfer RNA). Each of these tRNAs carries a specific amino acid with 'em. These tRNAs match up their specific anticodons with the codons on our mRNA friend.  Once they're all matched up nice and proper, them amino acids hitched to the tRNA start forming links to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, like building blocks. They keep on linking up till they hit a STOP sign (STOP codon) on that mRNA. This tells 'em they've done their duty and it's time to wrap it all up. So, you see, from the get-go with mRNA leaving the nucleus, we've got ourselves four major steps in protein synthesis: mRNA exit, tRNA anticodon-codon matchmaking, amino acid linking, and finally hitting that STOP codon.	b0916f09fe374f590654071222119a0f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA moving out of the nucleus, followed by four significant steps. First, during initiation, a small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA. Second, in elongation, tRNA transports corresponding amino acids to the mRNA and bonds them to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Third, this process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signaling termination. Finally, in release and recycling, the protein disconnects from the ribosome which then becomes available for another round of protein synthesis.	9924dd9bb980fe6a385264fb8f565480	-1	-1
5	Fus, mRNA leave de nucleus an' traverse through di cytoplasm to meet up wit' di ribosome or it go inside di rough endoplasmic reticulum. Nex', di rRNA read off di mRNA bases in groups of tree, we call dem codons.	f5b79ae6ef7c4043dbaa17566cbcb8ab	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA first departs the nucleus via a nuclear pore. It is then read by tRNA, which carries an anticodon that's complementary to a codon on the mRNA, thus following the rules of base pairing (U=A, C=G).	c845f486663029e8f375e55202ee53b6	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the cytoplasm, where it either heads to the ribosome or goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site, which triggers the process of linking amino acids together to form a protein (this step is called initiation).	7a099fea4835dc8b37957a2f0a42d737	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, here's how that protein-making process shakes out. Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it settles onto a ribosome and tRNA with a matching anticodon sidles up to each codon on the mRNA. Then, a fresh amino acid that corresponds is added to the tRNA and this keeps happening until we've got ourselves a full-blown protein. It's like building a car piece by piece in an assembly line.	f12e4172782c7d78b5cd37793183ad7b	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA bails oot of the nucleus and mooches through the cytoplasm before pitching up at the ribosome or nipping into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, rRNA gets cracking on reading the mRNA's bases in groups of three, ken as codons.	77f35285eec02c4625fddb14d8185023	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it proceeds to the ribosome where protein synthesis occurs. Here, each codon on the mRNA attracts a specific tRNA carrying an appropriate amino acid, which is then added to the growing peptide chain.	c0bef1548166b122c9f4ebe6930ee036	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves the mRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing translation in the ribosome, where each codon recruits a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying a corresponding amino acid. The tRNA then bonds its amino acid to the chain, progressively forming the protein as it interprets subsequent codons.	fcd7d19bc4baa3739ef026fc00a18ba4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit and Transport: The protein synthesis process kicks off when the mRNA, carrying genetic information from DNA, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and ventures into the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: mRNA then binds to the ribosome, a cell organelle responsible for protein production, or it may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum where ribosomes are located. 3. Translation Phase: During this phase, ribosomes 'read' mRNA sequences in a process known as translation, converting the genetic code into an amino acid sequence. 4. Protein Folding and Processing: The amino acid chain begins to fold into a complex three-dimensional structure, forming a functional protein; post-translational modifications may also occur to finalize the protein structure.	012cb37d5b76d1585a4cd6a0a3185463	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum. The process continues as amino acids are connected in sequence until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted, signalising the end of elongation and thus termination of protein synthesis.	fb7c90dfd6dd6641bbe689a2f8d04227	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis really kicks off when the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and gets cozy with a ribosome. First, there’s initiation where the ribosome clamps onto the mRNA at the start codon. Then comes elongation, where tRNA brings in the right amino acids, matchin' 'em up with the codons on the mRNA, real smooth like. This keeps goin', quieter than midnight in the Commons, until a STOP codon shows up and it's termination time. Finally, these amino acids that have been hitchin' a ride on the tRNA get linked together. It's like they're all holdin' hands, forming one big protein chain. And bam - you've got yourself a protein!	d2a6ee3ea654a2ca29290414c90df275	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA bails out of the nucleus and takes a trek through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or makes a pit stop at the rough endoplasmic reticulum, just like taking a taxi ride from Jozi to Cape Town. Then, amino acids are strung together like a string of colourful beads at a minstrel parade until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site gives the signal to call it quits, marking the end of elongation and onset of termination.	e14c2310d2f65a470f6ecb0f27e6c745	-1	-1
5	From the nucleus, the mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to reach its destination, either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon arrival, it triggers a key part of protein synthesis where each tRNA molecule is topped up with a matching amino acid.	0c5dcd674cfd98d6f914f1b4b1fefd7f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the initiation process where a START codon on the mRNA, having exited the nucleus, commands the beginning of amino acid linkage in the P site to form a protein. This sequence continues with elongation, adding more amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered at the mRNA's A site, triggering termination and thus concluding protein assembly.	8ae7015547cb4e540598c4e9aa16e2dc	-1	-1
5	Aye, protein synthesis gies as follows: First, the mRNA bides nae mair in the nucleus but trots its way intae the cytoplasm an' then tae either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, in comes the tRNA wi' its anticodon that's a perfect match for the mRNA's codon – it's all about pairin' U wi' A and C wi' G ye ken.	697c88602cd63b59118372d9fb38ce99	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus and relocates to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases are then read as triplets, known as codons, by another type of RNA called rRNA.	6f66118b8b7fbf942cb4f4409e7b62c4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus, then initiation occurs by aligning a START codon in the P site to begin forming a protein through the linkage of amino acids. This sequence progresses with the addition of a suitable amino acid to each tRNA, thereby continuing the chain.	35dc28e2f4961c873a6d71520a13442d	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA engages in protein synthesis where it is recognised by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, which deciphers its codon sequence following the base pairing rules of U=A and C=G.	7cbb2315abeceefe53ad234d9e4de1f7	-1	-1
5	Bang on, the protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA legging it from the nucleus to the ribosome or taking a detour through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a hurler on the puck, the tRNA carrying the matching anticodon steps up to recognise its partner codon on the mRNA.	a0c0ef036bd690988d8a5d77e153e39d	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart! It's just like bakin' a pecan pie, but instead of ingredients, we've got steps. Starts off with that mRNA sayin' bye to the nucleus and headin' out into the cytoplasm. Now it's time for the ribosome to step up to the plate - it attaches to that mRNA faster than a tick on a coon dog.  Here comes our tRNA, cute as a button and carryin' its own anticodon that matches up just perfect-like with the codon on the mRNA. Two peas in a pod, they are.  This is where the magic happens - the ribosome does its thing and a new amino acid gets added to the growing protein chain. That's 'bout all there is to it - ain't nothin' more complex than puttin' together grandma's old quilt.	8f1277ce1e0e1d4ca0a549ab018f7333	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or penetrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, a fresh amino acid that corresponds to the tRNA is added, marking a crucial step in protein synthesis.	fc6022a25d0cf7a230338a7e64aad04c	-1	-1
5	Okay, mek I tell yuh. De fus step, mRNA weh lef di nucleus, it bring wid it di message fram di DNA an dem rRNA read it ina groups a tree called codons. Nex ting, every codon got matching tRNA weh carry di right amino acid, an' dis acid join up wid di one pon di nex tRNA. Dis a how protein synthesis gwaan.	ea95b9d78c998914cf779c2052223ac2	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA that has left the nucleus gets recognized by a tRNA molecule carrying an anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA, following the complementary base pairing rule - Uracil pairs with Adenine, and Cytosine pairs with Guanine. Then, the process of elongation occurs where amino acids are continually added to the growing peptide chain until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, triggering the termination of protein synthesis.	300e5ec16e05997567d30541f10e06f0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA is first escorted out of the nucleus and it then travels to the ribosome, made up of rRNA, where its bases are read in groups of three - a process known as codons.  2. Then tRNA, carrying the anticodon which is complementary to the mRNA's codon (U pairs with A and C pairs with G), recognizes and binds to the appropriate mRNA codon, ensuring each amino acid is added in the correct sequence to produce an accurate protein. 3. This process continues along the entire length of the mRNA until a stop codon signal is reached. 4. Lastly, upon reaching the stop codon, protein synthesis halts, and the newly formed protein is released from the ribosome for further processing or function within or outside the cell.	72bfa57d61d2cba5be7086fa4963a148	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. After that mRNA gets the boot from the nucleus, it hitches a ride on a ribosome. First off, things fire up with a START codon in the P site, kickin' off the protein-making party by hooking amino acids together. Then, tRNA buddies haul in their amino acids and these fellas get to bonding with their neighbors. Before you know it, we got ourselves a brand new protein!	6436100e26671fd42150ed0fc32bdd57	-1	-1
5	A'right, here we go. Once mRNA scoots oot the nucleus, it gets read by rRNA in wee groups of three called codons, kind of like a secret recipe book, ye ken? Then it's time to start mixin' - amino acids get chained up together to cook up a protein, kicking off wi' a START codon in the P site, or as I'd say, nae wind, nae wave.	26511650fb9013ccce3e0acb94cf3a52	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, after which it journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or possibly enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, referred to as codons, facilitated by rRNA in a process that constitutes the next significant phase of protein synthesis.	ca77242bf11106b4be2d7546837245cd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA departs from the nucleus and arrives at the ribosome where decoding begins, involving tRNA molecules that recognize and bind to complementary mRNA codons with their corresponding anticodons. The process of elongation then follows, where amino acids are progressively linked based on these mRNA-tRNA interactions until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	2c732e794c81d4e34e76aafce3222396	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA exits the nucleus, it moves to the ribosomes where rRNA reads its bases in sets of three, termed as codons. Thereafter, transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying complementary anticodons identifies and binds to these mRNA codons, essentially translating the nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence that will form the protein.	6bbfe9584f50f3cb40025cbecb2155ae	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis involves several significant steps following the departure of mRNA from the nucleus. Firstly, the mRNA travels to the ribosomes where it's decoded during translation, with each codon signalling a specific amino acid to be brought by transfer RNA (tRNA); this results in a corresponding amino acid being tied to the tRNA. As the ribosome continues to read the mRNA, tRNAs deliver appropriate amino acids, which are then bonded adjacently to form a growing polypeptide chain. Lastly, when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, translation concludes, releasing the new protein for further modification and folding.	a9344eb3de07afa7d423b6a7630150a9	-1	-1
5	Ah, you're lookin' for the rundown on protein synthesis, huh? Well, first off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then the whole shebang kicks off with a process called translation where the information in the mRNA gets read in sections of three bases at a time, sorta like readin' sentences one word at a time. Next up, transfer RNA (tRNA) steps into the game by attaching themselves to these three-base sections, it's like findin' a dance partner at the Bunker Hill Day Parade. But here's the kicker: each tRNA molecule has an amino acid -the building blocks of proteins- hangin' on its other end. When they line up on the mRNA, these amino acids get strung together like lights on a Christmas tree down at Faneuil Hall, creatin' a new protein. It ain't faster than a Masshole drivin' down Storrow Drive, but it's wicked important for every single cell in ya body!	39725abff6f0d2e03d5054a071025c68	-1	-1
5	Sure, no problem. Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus like a rugby player bursting onto the field, we have Transcription where the mRNA is like a recipe copied from the DNA. Then we move to Translation, as smooth as a Cape Town jazz number, where the ribosome reads the mRNA and tRNA brings in the needed amino acids. Here's where things get as exciting as a Soweto derby - with Peptide Bond Formation, the amino acids on the tRNA are bonded together. Finally, we wrap up like a Sunday braai with Termination when a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, ending the addition of amino acids.	24ba289a9b4aad31fa0436f8eaf791db	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis kicks off with a process as significant as a prairie sky called transcription where the mRNA's bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA in the cytoplasm. The next major steps involve translation and elongation where amino acids are linked together like hockey players in a face-off until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, which signals termination of this process, wrapping things up like a peaceful Toronto night in July.	08d0dbc3b8229fcf723917c76b6fb5ea	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels into the cytoplasm and makes its way to the ribosome or it might enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site, triggering the linking of amino acids to form a protein in a process called initiation.	03491eb02e2800e5dd10315b8b9a1974	-1	-1
5	Startin' aff wi the mRNA skippin' oot the nucleus via the nuclear pore, it sets aff on its joorney. Followin' that, the mRNA's bases are read in groups ay three, whit we ca' codons, and this is done by rRNA, mind ye.	7b4a1d177e420051bfba7f57248e9fde	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying genetic code to ribosomes in the cytoplasm where translation occurs. Here, tRNA with complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G) recognizes and binds to the mRNA codons, leading to the formation of a chain as the corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA bond with those of the adjacent tRNAs, thereby synthesizing the protein.	25ea4563fa8fb81f6ce9ba40eea61392	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA, having transcribed the genetic information from DNA, departs from the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. Here, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in sets of three or codons, and transfer RNA (tRNA), acting as an adapter molecule, carries and adds a corresponding amino acid to each codon, leading to the formation of a polypeptide chain which eventually folds into a functional protein.	c91227bfecf710311544587639279831	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the translation phase. The process is continued by elongating the chain of amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, which signals termination and the completion of protein synthesis.	19909eed4d08eef5ba8a1116cfe4902d	-1	-1
5	The grand journey of the mRNA starts when it decides to leave the comfort of the nucleus through a wee nuclear pore, like a pint sliding down a bar. Then amino acids get linked together, one after the other, for donkey's years until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site, putting an end to all the craic - this is your elongation and termination right there, bang on.	5f5920ffb40230e34e0107588b666a71	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's chew the fat on this topic. First off, that there mRNA high-tails it outta the nucleus and moseys through the cytoplasm to shake hands with the ribosome, or sometimes it'll saunter right into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes a process slower than molasses in January where them mRNA bases are read in groups of three, or as the big-wig scientists call 'em, codons, and this shindig is orchestrated by rRNA. Now ain't that somethin' else?	7eebfc93ec116c1b6ff0729ca65aa819	-1	-1
5	1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) exits the nucleus and moves to the ribosome, where it serves as a guide for protein synthesis. Isn't it fascinating that they are responsible for carrying the genetic code? 2. The mRNA sequence is read by transfer RNA (tRNA) during a process called translation - tRNA plays matchmaker, wouldn't you agree?  3. Following the matching game, amino acids are linked together starting with a Start codon in the P site, known as initiation. Isn't it intriguing how each codon signals the addition of a specific amino acid? 4. Then, during elongation, another corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain on tRNA. Ever wondered how these individual amino acids create such complex proteins?	b280ff299a3b45ac44c0f539ab597187	-1	-1
5	Okay mi go tell yuh. First ting, de mRNA it leave de nucleus, it pass tru a likkle door name nuclear pore. Den yuh got dis odda one call tRNA, it carry de matchin anticodon and it recognize de codon dat same same like it pon de mRNA.	d0b07fcff7d48ebe036ceca6beedc0d9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA migrating from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it may either head to a ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once in position, the transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying the anticodon that is complementary to mRNA's codon (U=A and C=G) recognizes and binds to mRNA’s codon, a critical step in protein assembly.	964fbbd11e86287b1fbafb78a0eb8cf8	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus: The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore.  2. Ribosome reading mRNA: Then, in the cytoplasm, a ribosome connects to the mRNA to read its information. 3. tRNA bringing amino acids: Coming up next, a molecule known as tRNA brings amino acids over to the ribosome.  4. Peptide bonds formation: Lastly, on the other end of each tRNA, the corresponding amino acid is bonded to the adjacent amino acid on the next tRNA, forming peptide bonds and thus creating a protein chain.	778cd55fcfbf3070e2adb2d14d1716ec	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, so after mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, its bases are read in threesomes, we call 'em codons, by a particle called rRNA. Then along comes tRNA with its anticodon that fits snuggly with the mRNA's codon - think of it like a square peg finding its square hole.	8b88e32ea0dfe18ac636ca1f0c29360d	-1	-1
5	Right, so after our mRNA pal decides to leave the nucleus, it takes a wee journey through the cytoplasm till it hits the ribosome or pops into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then it's all systems go as amino acids get linked together, starting with a START codon in the P site, to create a strappin' new protein.	d34258eeb79b433ae4a052b2e9a903d4	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first major step is that mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by a type of RNA called rRNA, isn't that intriguing? Following this, the transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries the anticodon corresponding to each codon, identifies and aligns with the complementary codon of the mRNA - it's like they're speaking their own unique language!	b59010f25449f657fddec3b39e1ff683	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, moving into the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome. There, amino acids are continually linked based on the mRNA's sequence until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, ending the elongation process and thus completing protein synthesis.	8843a90dab68d2b52a6372333921f721	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Isn't it fascinating that the first step involves mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, like a coded message leaving its secret chamber?     2. Translation Initiation: Curiously enough, this mRNA then binds to a ribosome, initiating translation - much like starting to read a book, wouldn't you agree? 3. Codon Recognition: Have you ever thought about how each set of three nucleotides on mRNA, known as a codon, is recognized by a complementary tRNA? It's almost like fitting puzzle pieces together! 4. Peptide Bond Formation: Lastly, isn't it extraordinary that every time a new tRNA comes into play, it adds its amino acid to the growing chain, forming peptide bonds in the process? This ultimately leads to the creation of a unique protein!	f9e7bdba6415876551929f561154a54e	-1	-1
5	One key phase in protein synthesis is the voyage of mRNA from the nucleus into either the ribosome housed within the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Later, a significant step occurs when corresponding amino acids, found on the far side of the tRNA, establish a bond with adjacent amino acids on neighbouring tRNAs.	6ee4831b8f153108319920f4d78bc27c	-1	-1
5	Awright, so ya got yah mRNA skedaddlin’ outta the nucleus, right? From there, it's all action: first off, we get a START codon settin' up shop in the P site, kickin' off the protein production - think of it like openin' day at Fenway. Then, each tRNA swoops in with a fresh amino acid and they start linin' up one after anotha. It's like how us Bostonians queue up for chowda on a cold day - orderly, efficient and purposeful. Before ya know it, you've got yourself a brand new protein!	aef1ef67775481de29f3215dfe37e2b2	-1	-1
5	"Sure, let's take a walk through the magical process of protein synthesis. First off, mRNA, like a postman delivering an important letter, makes its journey out of the nucleus via the nuclear pore. Now comes the second step, where tRNA is not left behind as it grabs hold of a new amino acid, sort of like picking up groceries for a lekker braai. The third step is like a delicate dance, where the ribosomes read the mRNA in codons, imagine it being like reading directions to Gold Reef City. Lastly, our friend tRNA anticodon pairs with mRNA codon and the amino acid is added to the growing protein chain, showing us that just like ""a leopard doesn't change its spots"", every component has its own job in this process. These are small-small steps on their own but together they're as high as the Drakensberg."	f85faf9d32d7a0afa24ff12b8c743ca4	-1	-1
5	Alright, starting with that mRNA slipping out of the nucleus like a hockey puck on fresh ice, we've got four major steps in protein synthesis. First off, it's bigger than a prairie sky how the tRNA, hauling the complementary anticodon, recognizes its partner codon on the mRNA. Next up, as steady as a Canuck's resolve, the corresponding amino acids riding shotgun on the tRNA get bonded to the neighbouring tRNA's amino acids. It's a complex process, eh? But that's how proteins come together, heavy as a moose but essential to our bodies.	d41ef7adb0d2a8ac127abbdd68352659	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the process known as initiation when mRNA, having left the nucleus, carries a genetic code to a ribosome where a START codon is recognized in the P site to initiate the assembly of amino acids into a protein. Following this, during elongation, tRNA molecules decode the mRNA's message and bring corresponding amino acids which then get bonded to each other on adjacent tRNAs, eventually forming a polypeptide chain that folds into a functional protein.	d39e01312ca22cd81332f0b5960d7c4c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, efter leavin the nucleus, gets itself tae the ribosome where the hale protein synthesis starts (transcription). 2. The next step is the richt tRNA wi' its complementary anticodon recognises the mRNA's codon. In Scots speak, ye can imagine it like findin yer dance partner in a crowded ceilidh! 3. This leads tae the amino acids formin a chain, a braw string o' pearls if ye will, through a process kent as elongation. 4. Finally, when a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, we've reacht the end of our dance - this is the termination stage. It's like when the band plays the last tune at a ceilidh and everyone knows it's time tae stop.	95552e0a349f9e9269f992a8028056da	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm until it reaches its destination, either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, amino acids are continuously connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected, which signals the end of elongation and commences termination.	9b0719ee25e839a408f2f2e13bbf1f0d	-1	-1
5	Firstly, isn't it fascinating how the process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and making its way to the ribosome? Then, consider a transport RNA (tRNA) molecule which carries an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon (remember, U pairs with A and C with G), doesn't it ingeniously recognize and bind to this codon of the mRNA? Now, wouldn't you think that a new corresponding amino acid is added to each tRNA molecule? Lastly, can you picture how these amino acids bond with one another to form a polypeptide chain, eventually folding into a functional protein? Astounding, isn't it?	2f532dac1d24862414b8f6cc8d61e88f	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves a sequence of four major steps. Firstly, the mRNA reaches the ribosome where translation begins at the START codon found in the P-site, marking the initiation stage. Secondly, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying specific amino acids interact with corresponding mRNA codons through their anticodon, facilitating the elongation phase. Thirdly, as each new tRNA arrives, the amino acid it carries is linked to the growing chain and the spent tRNA is expelled - this continual addition of corresponding amino acids expands the polypeptide chain. Lastly, upon reaching a STOP codon on the mRNA sequence, translation termination occurs and the complete protein is released for folding and further modification, if necessary.	82a1a4e73f548342794d1db095afde90	-1	-1
5	Well, protein synthesis is a bit like the journey of a raindrop in an otter's pocket. Starting off, mRNA says its goodbyes to the nucleus and heads out into the cytoplasm, making a beeline for the ribosome or taking a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it's on the never never, with tRNA bringing along corresponding amino acids that bond together like they're rare as hen's teeth.	b19523b1fc116f371d5e3523fb8ae38f	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. It's as simple as pie really. First things first, that mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus and hightails it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or rough endoplasmic reticulum if you prefer. Then, those tRNA gents pair up with their corresponding amino acids and buddy up next to each other - kinda like a Southern potluck dinner line.	d76e021dcb5202f6ca7848f4b71b4d9d	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA departs the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm until reaching the ribosome or it penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this is the initiation stage, where protein synthesis kicks off with a START codon in the P site, leading to the linking of amino acids to form a protein.	4bd42326036b2c2f01f1b146f1779ef1	-1	-1
5	First step, mRNA does a grand exit from nucleus, passing through nuclear pore like it's the gateway. Then, tRNA receives a brand new amino acid matching with it. It's like putting the right key in the lock!	5f8b4a7c4d8c506652a6089c9d235aa1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying the genetic code to the ribosomes where translation occurs. There, tRNA adds new corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded to adjacent amino acids on other tRNAs, creating a growing polypeptide chain that will fold into the final protein.	ddac9078aa8d706e8bdf31ae23f05b46	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transcript: The process commences as the mRNA departs from the nucleus, carrying the genetic information for protein synthesis.  2. Translation Initiation: In the cytoplasm, it attaches to a ribosome, which is made up of rRNA and proteins. 3. Elongation: The mRNA's codons (groups of three bases) are read by tRNA molecules, which bring corresponding amino acids. 4. Termination & Polypeptide Release: These amino acids bond together to form a chain, which later folds into a protein.	56d217cf60151deb29ac8f62e360d48c	-1	-1
5	You betcha, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and heads over to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum faster than a jackrabbit on a date. At the ribosome, it's all about gettin' those amino acids linked up in a process we call elongation, and it don't stop until there's a STOP codon hollerin' from the A site on that mRNA.	6f60f26b98b64cda2a7d6950dd632890	-1	-1
5	Awright, here we gae! First off, the mRNA buggers off from the nucleus, as free as a bird. Next, it links up with the ribosome, a bit like a guid old blether at the local. Then, the mRNA message gets decoded by tRNA molecules - each one bringing along a new amino acid to add to the chain, strong as a lion they are. This goes on and on until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals it's time to wrap things up. Finally, our protein is ready, round as a pease!	3389a332545d94d7c9d35754c304556c	-1	-1
5	In the exhilarating process of protein synthesis, the mRNA makes a grand exit from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, embarking on its mission to facilitate protein production. With each stepping stone in this journey, a corresponding amino acid is robustly added to the tRNA, fortifying the protein structure we're building.	9659e90ce93f4a2268ba4d1b8e86a367	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, it zips through the cytoplasm and docks either at the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, heralding the beginning of protein synthesis. Then, we see a spectacular event where the corresponding amino acids hitched on one end of the tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids - all part of an intricate dance that results in the creation of proteins!	72f289b3d4d68170ad2d71f0b8f76628	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Starting with the audacious mRNA exiting the nucleus, it embarks on a vibrant journey through the cytoplasm to reach its destination - the industrious ribosome or it infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then meticulously deciphered in groups of three, referred to as codons, by the meticulous rRNA—each codon an encrypted message for a specific amino acid. This process is as intricate and beautiful as any orchestral symphony.	60fb38c79e487236a59d24560b40c136	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating, multi-step process that starts with mRNA departing the nucleus and involves several key stages. Firstly, initiation occurs, where amino acids are strung together to create a protein, starting at an all-important 'START' codon situated in the P site. Secondly, the corresponding amino acid located at the end of the tRNA forms a bond with the neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids, allowing for the formation of complex protein structures. These stages illustrate the remarkable precision and intricate mechanisms employed by our cells to produce proteins, essential to life itself.	ac2a72f476c5d54b98f56c3ab80f6b4d	-1	-1
5	Awright, aftah the mRNA makes its way outta the nucleus, it's time for protein synthesis, no kiddin'. First, mRNA takes a trip to the ribosome - they're like the Southie dockworkers of the cell. Aftah that, tRNA swoops in, bringing along amino acids that match up with the mRNA just like a perfect double parkin' job on Hanover Street. These amino acids get linked togetha one by one until they hit that STOP sign - or codon - on the mRNA and then bam, you've got your protein synthesized.	8e3c47aa4164c7bae9cb22e1a0a43282	-1	-1
5	Sure, no problem! Protein synthesis is like a veld fire that starts small-small but then spreads out from the nucleus with mRNA. The first major step, it's as dry as the Karoo but important, involves the mRNA leaving the nucleus and going to the ribosome where each tRNA molecule reads and deciphers it. Next, we add in new amino acids corresponding to the tRNA - this is like adding wood to our fire. The blaze keeps on growing as more and more amino acids are linked together, that's elongation for you. Finally, everything comes to a stop when a STOP codon gets read on the mRNA in the A site. And just like that, our protein synthesis veld fire has run its course!	ebdb6ef08b338aaba1a19263c5f49424	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a hockey game in the body, kicking off when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions like a star player, bounces out of the nucleus. Once on the rink, it initiates the process with an opening 'face-off' - a START codon in the P site - then hustles down ice linking amino acids together like forming a tight defensive line, until it encounters a full-stop equivalent - a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, bringing this round of protein synthesis to a climactic close.	5be6e05a42584370ead40e725303e79e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a thrilling molecular adventure, begins with mRNA bravely exiting the nucleus, carrying a coded message in the form of triplets known as codons and are meticulously read by rRNA. The second heroic character, the tRNA, valiantly steps into the spotlight carrying its complementary anticodon and recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA, setting the stage for an intricate dance of life's fundamental processes - protein synthesis!	bd7ad1676a41e0b939cc2bfe68093964	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA scoots oot o' the nucleus an' intae the cytoplasm whaur it gets hooked up tae a ribosome - this is whit we ca' initiation. Syne, during elongation, the ribosome reads the mRNA, an' for each codon, it reels in a matchin' transfer RNA (tRNA) carryin' a specific amino acid. This shindig keeps gaun till a STOP codon crops up on the mRNA in the A site, signallin' that it's high time tae end this dance - that's yer termination. Lastly, every time a new codon is read on the mRNA, another correspondin' amino acid is added tae the growin' protein chain. So, in short, it's like a grand ol' ceilidh that doesna stop until the band plays the final tune!	6f3f1ca5c66b38055698ca556c36c395	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the first significant step in protein synthesis is the journey of mRNA across the cytoplasm towards its destination - the ribosome. In some cases, it may also enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum for further processing.	e555f021a63a2f0fb735f70cc59270d1	-1	-1
5	Engaging in the exhilarating journey of protein synthesis, the mRNA bravely ventures forth from the nucleus, setting off four crucial steps. The process commences with translation initiation where the ribosome latches onto the start codon on the mRNA. Subsequently, elongation sees tRNA molecules ferrying appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, blending them into a growing polypeptide chain based on mRNA's blueprint. This dynamic assembly line persists until a STOP codon presents itself in the A site during termination, bringing this sophisticated operation to a halt. Lastly, but equally significant, a fresh amino acid is promptly assigned to the vacated tRNA, preparing it for another round of protein construction!	5074631318063efe29af93b589835ab4	-1	-1
5	Okay, let's get straight into this! The protein synthesis process kicks off with mRNA exiting the nucleus and heading towards ribosomes in the cytoplasm. This is where the whole translation party begins. Our mRNA transcript is decoded one codon at a time while each corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain by tRNA - imagine it as a tiny biological crane adding blocks to a construction site! Now we're onto elongation, which is just scientific lingo for this chain-growing phase; it continues until the ribosome reads a STOP codon from mRNA. Once that happens, it's game over for our protein synthesis – termination comes into play and the final product, a complete protein, is released. Four steps, countless proteins synthesised - a pretty amazing cellular operation!	b8f03c712f7051b5d96c1f5171c32c27	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, let's kick off with the mRNA, which, after serving donkey's years in the nucleus, finally gets a day out through the nuclear pore. Then we're on the never never, adding a new amino acid that's as solid as the Rock of Cashel to the tRNA for each codon it carries.	0f321576917bb029570ef4a835a04303	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's get a gander at this here process. Starts off like findin' a needle in a haystack with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus all proper-like through a nuclear pore. Then it's slower than molasses in January as each new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA, kind of like addin' more cattle to the herd.	3ee038a6bc49338fe57e157d4871a39b	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus and moves to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum located in the cytoplasm. Then, a process takes place where the corresponding amino acids connected to tRNA are bonded together with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a protein.	203fa146025593695a19fcb1c22ea01f	-1	-1
5	After mRNA move out from nucleus, it does four major steps for make protein. First step, the mRNA does link up with ribosome and tRNA. Second step, the mRNA does transfer the DNA message to the tRNA. Third step there, every time tRNA read one codon, a new related amino acid does add to the chain. Last step, the related amino acids on top other end of tRNA does join up with next tRNA’s amino acids.	08127bf0f9aed068f1c858c6b7d0d033	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus to initiate translation, a process where ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and recruit tRNAs carrying specific amino acids. As each codon on the mRNA is read, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain, which are bonded together through peptide bonds formed between adjacent amino acids, ultimately forming a protein.	67efd4421368d2cd089faa16b87c84ca	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome within cytoplasm or enters into rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. Then, the mRNA bases are interpreted in sets of three, known as codons, by the rRNA.	6d3458e5de9011ebbcc862b4cabaefdb	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus through a little thing called a nuclear pore. Then, ya got your tRNA which is carryin' this thing called an anticodon that knows just how to recognize the matching codon on that mRNA, kinda like findin' your truck in a cornfield at night.	bc513abe2e7f4a1377392fe2edb519c4	-1	-1
5	Richt, first off we hae the mRNA skippin' oot the nucleus an' heidin' to the ribosome, where the rRNA gies it a look o'er in triplets kent as codons. Then there's a right dance as each new matchin' amino acid is tacked onto the tRNA—a bit like addin' bricks to a wall, ye ken?	b3a1e56a27eda3f73b249e6d14ff511f	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Afterwards, the respective amino acids attached to transfer RNA (tRNA) create a bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	1778f4b37c4f287cf2ffb93ee9d1b5d4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and arriving at a ribosome to initiate translation. From there, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry corresponding amino acids to the ribosome to be added to a growing protein chain, this process continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is read, signaling the end of this elongation and marking the termination of protein synthesis.	6dd5f2f4e9f0a71b44ffc83f39c659cd	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves several key steps. First, initiation takes place where the START codon on the mRNA anchors to the P site, marking where amino acids will start to link together to form a protein. Following this, elongation occurs as tRNA molecules bring corresponding amino acids which bond adjacently to build a growing protein chain.	c927f3fbfbdceb46bc4e95584a2fe1ce	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA is decoded by tRNA which recognises and pairs with the complementary codon on the mRNA using its anticodon - adhering to the base pairing rules of U=A and C=G.	ed845dad5fa71b47e5aa49dc2d3df586	-1	-1
5	Awright, ya know how it goes. First off, mRNA buzzes outta the nucleus, then finds a ribosome. It's like putting together a puzzle, each tRNA molecule matchin' an mRNA codon, attachin' the right amino acid which gets linked into a dang chain, stronger than a Southie dockworker on overtime. This keeps goin' till we hit one of them STOP signs - I mean codons - on the mRNA in the A site. That's when things wrap up and you got yourself a protein.	2114223c0bc4c4d11b2f9b7abf0534df	-1	-1
5	Starting off, mRNA bounces out of the nucleus like a rugby ball kicked from its own 22, carrying the genetic code small-small to the ribosomes. Then, like a Jo'burg morning that starts cold but warms up as it gets going, the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence from a START codon at the P site and calls in tRNAs holding on to their amino acids tighter than a tick on a sheep's back; these are added one-by-one, forming a chain dry as the Karoo until they eventually bond together to become a protein.	5643ffd7471ace158dfb9516a144657b	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departing from the nucleus, protein synthesis begins with initiation where a START codon in the P site signals the assembly of amino acids. Subsequently, the amino acids on one end of the tRNA are linked to those on adjacent tRNA, forming a growing protein chain.	98011ec7cc38b9781d5da8ea0d7f37dc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, which then travels to the ribosome, marking the start of the process called initiation where the START codon is positioned at the P site. Subsequently, through a process known as elongation, tRNA brings corresponding amino acids that get linked together, forming a chain as they are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, eventually culminating in a new protein.	e7b4336408f1096c6bf14448d46bf384	-1	-1
5	First aff, the tRNA, hauldin the complementary anticodon, clocks the matchin codon on the mRNA. Syne, a new amino acid that matches up is plopped onto the tRNA.	94d2d3a72918c4b329e60333f8dd8568	-1	-1
5	During protein synthesis, the mRNA first leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the mRNA's base sequences are read in triplets, known as codons, by a type of RNA called rRNA.	2c5064daeb25b095d02ad1391adf5056	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA has left the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it is read in triplets known as codons by the rRNA, marking a critical step towards protein synthesis. This process allows for a specific sequence of amino acids to be assembled into a protein based on the genetic information carried within the mRNA.	f0e41f64c1b6997263110fa456aabeaf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA departing from the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome, where a corresponding amino acid is linked to the tRNA. This process of elongation continues, with amino acids being sequentially added until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signifying termination.	8b1422c291b944cb7b21acf8f90fac5d	-1	-1
5	Sure, 'tis as fast as greased lightning when mRNA ducks out of the nucleus, and makes its merry way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or it may take a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, without getting things arseways, a new matching amino acid gets added to the tRNA in a process wet as an otter's pocket, forming the cornerstone of protein synthesis.	30d87d110b209c2024e7462f0b683ebb	-1	-1
5	Well now, this ain't the easiest row to hoe, but I reckon protein synthesis starts with that mRNA moseying on out of the nucleus and taking a trip through the cytoplasm straight to the ribosome or heading over yonder to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it's like a square dance with them tRNA fellas bringing in amino acids and bonding 'em together, one after another, as nice as you please.	2f7ed375f30a879e1752d88f5d19e72d	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, post exiting the nucleus, journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. The second step is initiation, where the ribosome binds to the mRNA at a specific location and tRNA carrying an amino acid meets with the start codon on the mRNA. 3. During elongation, more tRNAs attach with their corresponding codons on the mRNA and add their amino acids to the developing protein chain.  4. Lastly, in termination, protein synthesis halts when a STOP codon appears in the A site of the mRNA, signifying that all amino acids have been correctly linked.	a81f4a62ff8b6176c85ca474080ffd74	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, post mRNA leaving the nucleus, involves four critical steps. First, it moves to the ribosome where initiation happens with a START codon in the P site linking amino acids to start making a protein. Then, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, allowing the development and elongation of the protein chain.	10884bc4705613dd6ecd250148b01316	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The subsequent steps involve protein synthesis where amino acids are covalently bonded in a sequence that is determined by a START codon present in the P site, initiating the process.	6aab5970ec833f8af428a0df94eca6e1	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA departs the nucleus and voyages to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, commencing protein synthesis. 2. The tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon (U=A, C=G), identifies the complementary codon on the mRNA, facilitating the assembly of amino acids into a protein chain.	bea2635164ece470ff7b3baa32afff50	-1	-1
5	Well, first thing's first, that mRNA has to skedaddle on out of the nucleus and make its way through the cytoplasm until it hits either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, all those amino acids start to link up tighter than bark on a tree to form a protein, and this whole shindig starts with a START codon sittin' pretty in the P site. This here process is what we call initiation.	5826ee0b6824b06b12a725249db5c4ab	-1	-1
5	Kicking off wi' mRNA scarpering from the nucleus, it either roams through the cytoplasm to meet the ribosome or takes a trek into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we've initiation, where amino acids start linking together tae craft a protein, all beginning with a START codon in the P site.	09fc144a01ccbbd1a657a61f55716d00	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome where the initiation phase commences with the alignment of a START codon in the P site, facilitating the linkage of amino acids to create proteins. The elongation step ensues, characterised by the bonding of adjacent tRNA's amino acids to their corresponding counterparts on another tRNA.	e91e83f91c12a0ca72989ff2fb10b7bf	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA enters the cytoplasm where it engages in protein synthesis. This process involves tRNA, which carries an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon (U=A and C=G), identifying the corresponding codon on the mRNA strand.	98d3f923eea0bcbeeab9ff418b9f91be	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when the mRNA, having exited the nucleus via the nuclear pore, reaches the ribosome, where the process of translation takes place. During initiation, the first major step, a START codon is recognized in the P site and an amino acid sequence begins to form, which through a series of steps including elongation and termination, eventually results in a fully formed protein.	ec4b4b6dc5a5c9c0667d3945d67d81c8	-1	-1
5	Upon departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA molecule is identified by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. This essential interaction, governed by a series of base-pairing rules, determines the specific sequence of amino acids for protein synthesis.	6fe24a46e99d4093f786bb2d42f16121	-1	-1
5	Alright, hoss, so ya got the mRNA skippin' outta the nucleus, right? First thing's initiation - that's when the amino acids start linkin' togetha like Sox fans on opening day, all kicked off by a START codon in the P site. Next up is elongation and termination - basically just means they keep on joinin' till they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, kinda like hittin' rush hour on the Pike. There y'have it, four steps of protein synthesis.	c80eb1f6ad214a46ead881d6f0103c50	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's chat about the protein synthesis dance. First off, it’s like a veld fire how mRNA pops out of the nucleus and takes a lekka journey to the ribosome for translation. Now, these codons, each a unique triplet on the mRNA, they're read small-small by rRNA in the ribosome. It's just like matching puzzle pieces when tRNA carries the complementary anticodon, cold as a Jo'burg morning but accurate (U=A, C+G), and recognises its partner codon on the mRNA. This whole shebang helps to string together amino acids into a protein, thus completing this intricate dance of life.	cdf1bf3e6f5f0f2bb983d7a4adb3eeba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore, gets decoded by the ribosome in a process referred to as translation. This procedure relies on the recognition of specific codons by tRNA molecules, leading to the linking of corresponding amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signalling the end of elongation and termination of the protein chain.	66454b2135138e426c1757a379cab201	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the triplet codons of mRNA being interpreted by rRNA once it exits the nucleus. Subsequently, using a START codon at the P site as a starting point, amino acids are connected to fabricate a protein, a process known as initiation.	c4f1b4811410bfdb422ea92739e9bd76	-1	-1
5	Awa' frae the nucleus, mRNA, wi its bases read in triplets kent as codons by rRNA, maks its journey through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Wi each step, protein synthesis advances, giein' life tae the cells an' ultimately tae us.	7b4970491fc6415aee93f9e2d8f13232	-1	-1
5	Initiating with the extrication of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis comprises four pivotal stages. The first is transcription, where the DNA code is transcribed into mRNA within the nucleus. Following this, mRNA molecules exit the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm, which leads to the second phase known as translation, whereby the information coded in mRNA is utilized by ribosomes (made of rRNA) to assemble amino acids in a specific order, interpreting the mRNA bases in sets of three, termed codons. The third step, elongation, engages in continuously linking these amino acids guided by the codon sequence. The process concludes or terminates when a 'STOP' codon emerges on the mRNA's A site, signaling an end to amino acid assembly and the completion of protein synthesis.	238d7aec6e53fd25aed1497aa3de007e	-1	-1
5	Initiating with the migration of mRNA out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, an intricate process of protein synthesis commences. Evolution continues as amino acids are sequentially linked, dictated by the mRNA in the A site, until a STOP codon is encountered, signifying termination of the process.	96f02332bf0289b727050b796d9c79e9	-1	-1
5	Departing from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA sets off the process. It then initiates protein synthesis by marking a START codon in the P site, which acts as a guideline for linking amino acids together to construct a protein.	68c56c6fe8d0e2daa117aa8891b9475c	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA, as wet as an otter's pocket, escapes from the nucleus using the nuclear pore, it sets off for the ribosome. Following this, a new amino acid that's rare as hen's teeth is added to the tRNA in a process that's quare complex.	6c4f4c024460d2827134ddc88ab4a8a3	-1	-1
5	Well, I'll tell ya, this ain't no hard row to hoe. First off, that mRNA makes a break from the nucleus through a little thing called the nuclear pore. Once it's out in the open, a brand spankin' new amino acid gets added on to the tRNA, cute as a button. This here is how the first steps of protein synthesis get done, y'all.	f53671ba2a883e635d2274cd775cd235	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, entering the cytoplasm.  2. Then, it travels to the ribosome, or may go into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 3. At the ribosome, a process called translation occurs where the mRNA sequence is read and translated into amino acids. 4. These amino acids are then linked together in a specific order to form a protein.	e868ee47324037e9053213375c8892c4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start when mRNA exit nucleus, where amino acids join up for make protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site, called initiation. Then, tRNA with anticodon weh match (like U=A, C+G), it recognize and link up to the matching codon of the mRNA.	06259fd01f6251008e7a03d1232bbf6f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase, where mRNA leaves the nucleus and a START codon in the P site triggers the linkage of amino acids to form a protein. The process continues in the elongation phase, adding more amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, signaling termination of protein synthesis.	c7792c0e27ee4067cd9fa6621ce8ba1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting nucleus and getting to ribosome. There, protein sequence is built as tRNA brings corresponding amino acids, which bond together, till a stop codon on mRNA signals end of this process.	8d4363282138c5615238e55e57356d4e	-1	-1
5	Well ya see, after mRNA leaves the ol' nucleus, a whole buncha steps take place. First you got that tRNA with its amino acids stickin' to each other like bees on a honey pot. Then, those amino acids keep joinin' up in a chain, kinda like a game of telephone, till a STOP sign shows up on the mRNA, tellin' 'em to quit their yammering and call it a day.	c8bc5c89f8b23a1ebe16962f5b00ecdf	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA bails oot the nucleus, it's aff tae the ribosome where translation kicks aff. Here the mRNA attracts matching tRNA molecules loaded with amino acids, and these wee buggers keep linking up like a ceilidh line until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA.	c0140237be2a75f1b9e244a5930759a0	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the mRNA commences the protein synthesis process. As part of this, a matching amino acid is incorporated into the developing protein chain through the action of transfer RNA (tRNA).	6f273721254083887241e9131b802f03	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and getting decoded in triplets, known as codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Then, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules match these codons with their respective amino acids which they carry, leading to the bonding of adjacent amino acids carried by different tRNAs.	8b76cd37bd187e15c86cedffc4f38c21	-1	-1
5	The first step of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, which carries genetic information, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Next, within the cytoplasm, tRNA molecules carry respective amino acids that bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a chain that eventually results in a protein.	8bd81ad2c15bbe6dab2fb1863c0c25c3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where its bases are read in codon sets of three by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The transfer RNA (tRNA) then identifies the mRNA's complementary codon using an anticodon, following the base-pairing rules of uracil pairing with adenine and cytosine pairing with guanine; this allows specific amino acids to align and form a protein.	dca7b1ae7e878b906333f19ac1ae3108	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA, tough as a Southie dockworker, leaves the nucleus, hustles through the cytoplasm and heads right to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got the tRNA, dense as chowder, carrying an anticodon that's just right to match up with the mRNA's codon -- it's like they're talkin' in their own language where U pairs with A, and C pairs with G.	eef87feef2513ca2d3ff9183870b3f38	-1	-1
5	Ja, so let's get cracking. Beginning with mRNA leaving the core, first thing is initiation where the START codon gets in the P site, linking up amino acids to kickstart protein manufacturing. Thereafter, like a leopard not changing its spots, the corresponding amino acids on tRNA stick right next-door to their neighbours, bonding small-small to create this whole protein.	bf3318193ac669db2672ace53ae9c22b	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! mRNA makes a beeline out of the nucleus and gets its bases read in batches of three, known as codons, by rRNA - a process that's as meticulous as a Mountie. Then, like a hockey player on a breakaway, a matching amino acid is snatched up and added to the tRNA – just as smooth as calm lake water.	e75861425c32d2543ee726b58a3ca6cc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA migrating from the nucleus to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, each tRNA molecule linked with an amino acid pairs with mRNA codons, triggering the addition of a new amino acid to the synthesizing protein.	bafd525904c31ed3d393db1e13de7ffa	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gits oot the nucleus through a wee hole called the nuclear pore. Then, amino acids stairt tae be linked thegither intae a protein, beginnin wi a START codon in the P site, an' this process is kent as initiation.	ee31916d55f972b1f37a3c92f5610655	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and its bases being read in sets of three, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The process further involves initiation where the protein formation starts with a START codon in the P site, binding to specific amino acids and linking them together.	7d7aa407f470da9bb7871064bf36aff1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, which contains genetic instructions, exiting the nucleus and interacting with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the cytoplasm where its bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying an anticodon complementary to the codon on the mRNA, recognizes and binds to the mRNA, a process that leads to the synthesis of proteins based on the code provided by these base pairings.	67236364a53a873a924877a0bfc226ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing initiation, where a START codon aligns amino acids in the P site to commence protein creation. The process continues with elongation and concludes at termination when a STOP codon is detected on the mRNA in the A site, signifying the end of amino acid linking.	c7b8427f0917bb0c76c6a0cf293e955b	-1	-1
5	Well, it's quare simple when you get the hang of it. To begin with, in protein synthesis, mRNA departs the nucleus and its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA - this is as accurate as a bang on watch, mind you. Then, like a farmer in a wet field, each new amino acid gets added onto the tRNA, building up the protein bit by bit until it's as full as an otter's pocket.	c76545aeca4fdb75fab18a1429b52639	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon this process kicks-off faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, with that mRNA jumpin' out the nucleus, making its way to the ribosome. It's here where them tRNA fellas, cute as buttons but important as all get-out, bring amino acids that match the mRNA's codons. Now, these amino acids get linked up like cousins at a family reunion, keepin' at it until there's a STOP sign on that mRNA. So, you see y'all, just like a good Southern potluck, everything comes together just right to make something real special - in this case, our protein.	00132eca10574fe817863f650b17dd64	-1	-1
5	1. The first step in protein synthesis happens when mRNA waves goodbye to the nucleus and heads off on an exciting adventure, traveling through the vibrant cytoplasm to either the busy city of the ribosome or the bustling hub of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Next, we move onto translation, where each codon of the mRNA matches up with an anticodon on a tRNA molecule. 3. In our third act, amino acids are brought along for the ride by tRNA, eager to play their part in the grand story of protein synthesis. 4. Finally, we reach the climax of our tale, where a corresponding new amino acid is joyfully added to the growing chain on the tRNA, signaling another step towards completing the beautiful masterpiece that is a protein.	e8a3e78b252571ad2b7528481994434b	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA does tek a trip from nucleus go straight to the cytoplasm and link up with di ribosome, or it does step inside rough endoplasmic reticulum. After that, di amino acids dem just keep on joining together till dem read a STOP codon pon di mRNA inna the A site - this part dem call elongation an' termination.	1338d4cebe951f24af3a6ba0cb3510e9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying the genetic code from DNA inside the nucleus, traverses through a nuclear pore to enter the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, translation occurs where amino acids are sequentially linked based on the codons in the mRNA until a STOP codon is detected, signaling the end of protein assembly.	6da9f9179950cf52951e2ac20bb64380	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves nucleus through nuclear pore, it embarks on a journey to the ribosome. Here, tRNA continues the process by adding the corresponding amino acid to its structure, setting the stage for protein synthesis.	4afbdfe8bbc6e103d3ccf4611ed82641	-1	-1
5	Well, once mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, the first stop on our protein synthesis train ride is when tRNA, carrying its complementary anticodon (think of it like each letter matchin' up to its partner, A with U and C with G), recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon. Then, it's all hands on deck as amino acids start linking together to make a protein - that whole shebang starts with a START codon parking itself in the P site. That's what we call initiation.	f74a10aa4409b67ba2daf81a6c78a421	-1	-1
5	First things first, the mRNA makes a swift exit from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, just like a wee scallywag sneaking out of class. Then, armed to the teeth with the right anticodon, the tRNA jigs over to the mRNA and bonds with it, showing off their perfect fit like an age-old dancing couple.	bbde25057d5e60e3c4e7facd6b912388	-1	-1
5	Kick-starting the process of protein synthesis, mRNA bursts out from the nucleus carrying the genetic code. As it enters the ribosome, it begins with a START codon in the P site, initiating the procedure where tRNA recognises and binds to its complementary codon on the mRNA strand (U=A, C+G), leading to the linking of amino acids that eventually forms a protein!	762dffb8fe68d2577921c8d263be6db8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when the mRNA, having left the nucleus through a nuclear pore, attaches itself to a ribosome for translation. The process continues with amino acids being linked together based on the codons of the mRNA during the elongation phase until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signifying termination, and thus completing protein synthesis.	efd54983faf6e1142c502bf44e03199a	-1	-1
5	Starting with its adventurous journey from the nucleus, our main protagonist, mRNA, navigates through the bustling world of the cytoplasm to finally reach its destination - the ribosome or sometimes it even dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the real magic begins as amino acids are intricately linked together, initiating with a special START codon in what we call the P site, and voila, we have a freshly synthesized protein!	4dd6d5da9900be44617b4847f4f22161	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, we step into the world of protein synthesis. Initiation sets the stage as our mRNA meets a START codon in the P site, marking the start of our amino acid chain. This is followed by elongation, where each tRNA, with their respective amino acids, align themselves in an orchestrated manner, linking these amino acids together to form a budding protein. This process continues until we reach a STOP codon, signalling termination - the final curtain call where the newly formed protein is released.	3bf12c8b05d1ce10c1d406e23e574fa9	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first off, this here mRNA scoots out from the nucleus and heads into the cytoplasm, right? It either makes a beeline for the ribosome or dives into that rough endoplasmic reticulum wicked fast. Now here's where it gets juicy - these tiny things called amino acids start gettin' linked together to whip up a protein, kickstarted by a START codon in the P site, you got it? That's your initiation right there.	586e15ebbb0c1af2912a8dbc9b00dbd4	-1	-1
5	Alright, starting with the mRNA jumping out the nucleus like a veld fire that's caught wind, we hit the first major step of protein synthesis. In this phase, initiation, we've got amino acids linking up to form a protein, and this whole jol begins with a START codon in the P site, strong as a lion leading the pride. Next up, our mRNA bases are read in what we call triplets or codons - by none other than rRNA. It's like reading a recipe three ingredients at a time.  Following that, the third step is when tRNA enters the game, bringing along an amino acid and matching it up with the corresponding mRNA codon on the ribosome. It's all about getting the right pieces together. Lastly, once the stop codon has been read (like reaching the peak of the Drakensberg), the protein is released and synthesis comes to an end. Tjo! The whole process is like one big, intricate dance on a microscopic level. What a jol!	a04cac41363f5d93d72bdf096a5721b4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, as swift as a Calgary wind after mRNA exits the nucleus, initiates at the ribosome located either in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process kicks off when the mRNA's START codon nestles into the P site on the ribosome, signaling for amino acids to gather and link together, forming a protein chain as tight as a beaver's dam.	9fe7943917fa57e998761826469a3e71	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is indeed a fascinating process! It all starts when mRNA voyages from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rugged terrain of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes translation, where tRNA molecules, each carrying its corresponding amino acid, link to adjacent tRNA's amino acids - it's like molecular matchmaking on a microscopic level!	bc8119f2caed13e55519a10b4dd4ffdc	-1	-1
5	Richt frae the aff, mRNA skites oot o' the nucleus, kicking aff protein synthesis. It aw begins wi' a START codon sookin up its place in the P site, bringing amino acids into play - they're like the building bricks, ye ken? Then these wee tRNA fellas swing into action, each baring their ain corresponding amino acid ready tae be bonded wi' their neebors. It's a bonnie dance, it is - ane step efter anither until we've got oorselves a protein!	6258186d7565298e5abcfdb642e73b86	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a crucial first step that sets the stage for other steps. The second major event is the interpretation of mRNA's sequence of codons by rRNA, which can be likened to deciphering a secret code, as each triplet of bases is transcribed and translated into specific amino acids that make up proteins.	aaa6d02289aa39a0f79adde409b65c3d	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Protein synthesis is an exciting process starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to a ribosome, where rRNA amazingly reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA) steps into action, each adding a new corresponding amino acid in response to each codon, effectively building a protein - it's truly an awe-inspiring example of cellular efficiency!	4d90861de4288f1d9b06cdd388443f35	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a captivating cascade of processes! With mRNA exiting the nucleus, it first reaches the ribosome where its bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. Then come tRNAs, each recognising a specific codon and carrying the corresponding amino acid. As if by magic, these amino acids bob along to connect with their neighbours on adjacent tRNA molecules, creating that fantastic chain we call a protein!	160a822883368fe93ca459d0c1fdab3e	-1	-1
5	Sure, there's a grand dance that happens when mRNA makes its way out of the nucleus and starts the process of protein synthesis. First off, like a lad with his favourite song, the mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons - it's been this way for donkey's years! Then, wouldn't you know it, the tRNA carrying the anticodon comes along, as precise as an otter in water spotting its prey, recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA. It's all a bit arseways when you think about it, but somehow it works to create the proteins we need!	abaad5a5f79627ec8d95def558a07ab2	-1	-1
5	Well, sugah, this is a bit like findin' a needle in a haystack, but let's give it a whirl. Firstly, you got that mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus and gettin' read in groups of three, which we call codons. Then, just as sure as cornbread goes with collard greens, along comes the tRNA bearin' the anticodon - that's just fancy talk for matchin' up with the codon on the mRNA. Now we're cookin' with gas! This here process is how proteins get built, one amino acid at a time.	a95b8d77312f01a6a96e2d6baa817c58	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four major steps in protein synthesis are: 1) mRNA moves to a ribosome where the process of translation begins. 2) The tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies its matching mRNA codon. 3) Corresponding to each specific tRNA anticodon, an appropriate amino acid is added. 4) This process continues until all amino acids have been linked together creating a complete protein molecule.	82f0fdba5798ac3a04ca22c6283b507a	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaving nucleus and it going through cytoplasm to ribosome or it entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two, rRNA reading mRNA bases in groups of three, we calling this codons.	356ef01bec6cf03237b50ab60d1a9da4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to a ribosome where translation occurs. There, tRNA molecules carrying the complementary anticodon recognize and bind to the corresponding codon on the mRNA, and each tRNA molecule has a specific amino acid attached to it that is then added to the growing peptide chain, forming a protein.	fc0dd515d51c121014d48d231d18110b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it provides instructions for protein synthesis.  2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the information provided by mRNA and brings in appropriate amino acids.  3. The ribosome then links these amino acids together, creating a polypeptide chain.  4. Finally, the freshly synthesized protein undergoes folding and other modifications before being ready for use. Each step is vital in ensuring the correct protein is formed.	67b31d655b5dc574b6e3cb3dc2f5e9ed	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA's up and at 'em outta the nucleus, here's what it gets into. First thing is, every tRNA molecule finds its partner by matchin' up an mRNA codon with its own anticodon, finer than frog hair like. Then, each one hauls in a new amino acid to tag along. Now this is where it tight as bark on a tree, these amino acids from one tRNA get bonded together with those from its neighbors, creatin' a growin' protein chain. That's the long and short of it!	da5be2248ba2b0dcbee32cbf04db936d	-1	-1
5	Right, so first off, the mRNA buggers off oot the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then, you've got this character called tRNA - it's not as daft as it sounds, nah - it's carrying the matching anticodon and spots the complementary codon of the mRNA.	25f09869128cb963b314a0354d7182f1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving towards the ribosomes, where its bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by the rRNA. This process continues with the linking of amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling completion of elongation and triggering termination.	80f04b220bb9f3cbbaf8a2fb373f07f5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, matching U with A and C with G, thus facilitating protein synthesis.	78ee891d9dd8d6b14b17fa536e78e514	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit from Nucleus: The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information to the ribosomes located in the cytoplasm.     2. Ribosome Binding and Initiation: The mRNA binds to a ribosome, where translation of genetic code starts at a specific sequence called the START codon situated in the P site, initiating the process to link amino acids together. 3. Elongation: With the mRNA in place, tRNA molecules bring appropriate amino acids to the ribosome which are then connected in a chain as per the sequence of codons on the mRNA. 4. Termination: This elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis and releasing the newly synthesized protein.	a3392bd4b1f4b49ba686640b812503f9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, which is then read by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. This triggers the formation of a peptide bond between amino acids linked to adjacent tRNAs, leading to a growing polypeptide chain that eventually forms a complete protein.	ad3b38514797461bedcf958dae35eada	-1	-1
5	Awright, so aftah mRNA skips outta the nucleus, it's all 'bout the tRNA. You see, this guy carries the complementary anticodon and can recognize the codon on the mRNA, sorta like a Sox fan recognizin' a Yanks cap at Fenway. Then we got these amino acids that start to link up togethah to create a protein. This all kicks off with a START codon in what they call the P site. It's wickid smart how it all works, I tell ya.	964b9acc5067c0a680e541b31d1032c1	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA bailing from the nucleus like it's dry as the Karoo, it takes a gander through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, you got your tRNA pulling a sly one by carrying the anticodon that's a mirror image of the mRNA codon - just like checking yourself out in a dam's reflection on a still day, each 'U' pairs with an 'A' and each 'C' finds a 'G'.	52ce1300fa4b53adb74771ab65e01852	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis initiates with the transcription phase where DNA is transcribed to mRNA inside the nucleus. Next, during translation, the mRNA moves into the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome, where its bases are read like a map in triplets known as codons by rRNA. This process, as changeable as Maritime weather, sees tRNA bringing corresponding amino acids to the ribosome for attachment to the growing peptide chain, a process as accurate as a Mountie's aim. The final act is elongation and termination, which continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, ending the assembly with a finish as clear-cut as Prairie farmland.	0d07a126bee09c87ce0e52c6abede7de	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it ventures into the cytoplasm and attaches to the ribosome or gets integrated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of elongation continues in which amino acids are sequentially joined until a STOP codon on the mRNA is interpreted in the A site, thereby signifying termination.	55b9541547c62359007e97109db6f335	-1	-1
5	Awa frae the nucleus, mRNA journeys through the cytoplasm till it finds a ribosome or gaes intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, that's what we ca' codons.	2cd09fcf066c9bcc196783133fcee8e8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, amino acids are assembled into a protein, a process which begins with a START codon located in the P site, marking the beginning of a sequence that signals the protein-building machinery to start its work (initiation).	a4eebcc297af163f43c214e4d46b5eeb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, comprising codon triplets, departs the nucleus and is interpreted by rRNA. The protein fabrication process kicks off with a START codon in the P site, where numerous amino acids are sequentially linked to form the final protein.	d8424265bbdd005f67b07a66fb0414ca	-1	-1
5	Post exiting the nucleus, mRNA voyages across the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, tRNA transports the complementary anticodon and recognises the matching codon on the mRNA strand, applying the base-pairing rules (U=A, C+G).	4483c8594bb9490346b2954a926f16a6	-1	-1
5	Like a letter zipping out of the post office, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus as fast as greased lightning. Then it's chock-a-block with activity - the tRNA adds a new corresponding amino acid, rare as hen's teeth, and then in the P site, which is as solid as the Rock of Cashel, a START codon kicks off the process of linking these amino acids together to form a protein.	e41f570f86b0937c67efe1f6c64da069	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon the first thing that's gonna happen is that mRNA is gonna hightail it out of the nucleus right through a nuclear pore. Then, bless its heart, it's gonna make its way through the cytoplasm till it finds itself a ribosome or it might just wander on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	f538736e124f7d7980aaf8ef158fb580	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the protein synthesis process. Following that, each tRNA molecule, matching the mRNA's codons, brings a new corresponding amino acid to be added, building up the protein strand.	4320efc1759fcfc928ad965fbab139c4	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA does make its way out of the nucleus through nuclear pore, carrying with it information critical to protein synthesis. Following that is initiation, where a START codon in the P site signals the start of amino acids being strung together to form a protein.	d7059bed2bc31f345d30c9ac6ba84bbb	-1	-1
5	The four major steps in protein synthesis commence when mRNA departs the nucleus. First, mRNA enters the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome, where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA in the second step. The third step witnesses transfer RNA (tRNA) pairing up with these codons, each tRNA carrying a specific amino acid. Lastly, as each tRNA matches its codon on the mRNA strand, the carried amino acid is added to a growing chain in the fourth step, gradually forming a complete protein.	98ff2de0bff62cb0912396fa8a6558e0	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it goes to the ribosome where it serves as a guide for building protein. During translation process, tRNA brings in new amino acids that match the mRNA sequence, adding them to the growing protein chain.	a66c1d0e867d5b231aad6a5ce1a4cd43	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, first off, after mRNA skedaddles on outta the nucleus, it's got these triplets of bases we call codons, and these get read by a thingamajig named rRNA. Then this other doodad named tRNA, carrying what we call an anticodon (that’s just a fancy term for being opposite, like U to A or C to G), recognizes that codon on the mRNA and latches onto it tighter'n bark on a tree.	ba9d53f94e43a056cf6be53e73ba47ba	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA makes a swift jaunt out the nucleus, dandering through the cytoplasm till it reaches the ribosome or gets itself in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, an amino acid that's as fitting as a glove to the tRNA is chucked into the mix, a vital step in getting this protein synthesis show on the road!	4aebb5abfa3bc3c6e8c258e0a838e038	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the protein synthesis process embarks on a captivating journey. It proceeds to link amino acids continuously, guided by the mRNA in the A site, until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling both elongation and termination of this intricate biological procedure.	0f22b7af6eacc6f630858eca569d7bae	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, protein synthesis progresses as tRNA's corresponding amino acids bond with those of adjacent tRNAs, forming a growing polypeptide chain - the beginning of a new protein.	f21082c2ed968f960e0da166392d3f32	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves several critical steps. Firstly, mRNA travels through the cytoplasm and either engages with a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and this movement sets the stage for the translation process. Secondly, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the bases of the mRNA in triplets, commonly referred to as codons. It is these codons that provide the blueprint for the specific sequence of amino acids that will form the resulting protein.	cbe62892395f4ddf56b54b8d9f2a542c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the mRNA migrates from the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm until it reaches either the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The subsequent phase involves the creation of peptide bonds between neighbouring amino acids, attached to their respective tRNA molecules, a process that meticulously constructs the protein.	81da17a7e27420c54bd60c88c5177478	-1	-1
5	"Alright, ya got the mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus, right? So, first up, ya got this thing called tRNA and it's carryin' the opposite, or ""complementary"" if you wanna get all technical, anticodon that recognizes its match on that mRNA. It's like findin' your car in a packed Fenway lot - gotta have the right match. Then, these amino acids hitchin' a ride on the tRNA bond with the neighbors - kinda like us Sox fans stickin' together. That's the nuts and bolts of it."	22fd0e8c032119a6fb491ecd0b633eef	-1	-1
5	Eish, here's the process quick-quick. The mRNA, nifty as a meerkat, scoots through the nuclear pore, waving cheers to the nucleus. Thereafter, it's read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA - like a lekker braai recipe where each step is critical for that perfect sosatie. This dry-as-the-Karoo explanation is just small-small part of the whole story, but it covers the key steps in protein synthesis.	9be30870e3d21658ea4e4184af0a74b8	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA making a beeline out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore, our protein synthesis journey unfolds. It's as steady as a Canuck's resolve, with amino acids being strung together like a chain of Rocky Mountains until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, signalling that it's game over for elongation and termination.	ad5cab841141bf772a1b004970277c2e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a miraculous interplay of molecules, commences when mRNA, carrying the genetic code from DNA, exits the nucleus to enter the cytoplasm. Here, ribosomes latch onto the mRNA, initiating the translation process where tRNA molecules recognize and bind to corresponding codons on the mRNA, each carrying specific amino acids that link together in a chain to form proteins. This assembly line of protein formation persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling an end to this elegant process.	0f2e5f11bf8d915216dcda3222b6d8d7	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA sneaks oot the nucleus through a wee nuclear pore. Then, the real work begins wi' amino acids getting linked thegither tae mak a protein, an' that aw starts wi' a START codon in the P site, or what we call initiation.	a3c47365f28e1437d56d17d92185e9cc	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm and either finds itself at the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum; this constitutes the first major phase of protein synthesis. Subsequently, an important process unfolds where each tRNA's corresponding amino acids bind to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, signaling a key aspect of the protein formation pathway.	922121b90b22bce33dc8a996b6921667	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis commences when mRNA, a type of RNA molecule that carries genetic information, leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm. This is followed by the process of translation where each codon on the mRNA matches an anticodon on the tRNA, which subsequently attracts a corresponding amino acid, thus adding it to the growing peptide chain and facilitating the synthesis of a new protein.	876c03605546e3f349560119ee4be093	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA exits the nucleus and in the ribosomes, it is decoded by rRNA in groups of three bases known as codons. Following a START codon, a sequence of amino acids is initiated, which subsequently link together in the P site to form a protein.	d49deb05b3a8713b40cb7b828497a0bc	-1	-1
5	Right then, 'tis like this you see - when mRNA ups sticks from the stable nucleus, it's on the never-never through cytoplasmic seas to dock at either the ribosome harbour or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, a fresh amino acid is tacked onto the tRNA - they're needed for protein synthesis like hen's teeth!	2665792334b505a925c4fcdde76eef4c	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's get this show on the road. Firstly, that mRNA slips outta the nucleus faster than greased lightning and meanders its way through the cytoplasm until it finds itself at the ribosome or gets caught up in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got translation where each codon of the mRNA matches up with a specific amino acid via tRNA; it’s like a jig saw puzzle, every piece has its own place. This ain't no one-trick pony. The process keeps repeating itself, each time adding a new corresponding amino acid to the growing protein chain, just like stringin' pearls for a necklace. So, four major steps involved in protein synthesis would be: mRNA leaving nucleus, mRNA traveling through cytoplasm to ribosome or entering rough endoplasmic reticulum, tRNA matching with mRNA codon and lastly, new corresponding amino acid getting added to tRNA. Now ain't that a hard row to hoe?	a4e00ea1dcc77e9dacb6218900096ffa	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the protein synthesis process includes the following key steps: First, ribosomes attach to mRNA in the cytoplasm starting protein synthesis. Second, transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying an anticodon recognizes and binds to the complementary codon on mRNA, ensuring each amino acid matches with its correct codon. Third, a peptide bond forms between adjacent amino acids, initiating a chain that continues to grow. Lastly, when the ribosome encounters a STOP codon on mRNA, it terminates protein synthesis and releases the completed protein chain.	54afe52c2d1902fae15a401e861de3f5	-1	-1
5	The first big step in protein synthesis starts with mRNA coming out from the nucleus. Four key stages then happen:  1) The mRNA gets read in groups of three, what them call codons, by a something named rRNA.  2) Then, you have what them call elongation where the amino acids keep linking up until the mRNA in the A site reads a STOP codon. 3) After that, comes termination which pretty much is when that STOP codon gets read and the whole process halt.  4) And lastly, the newly formed protein goes through post-translational modifications to get it properly set for its job.	3f9a23a5c90a7c6034f7b571cf59886a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and venturing into the cytoplasm, where it locates a ribosome or finds entry to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the second step, a complementary amino acid is affixed to the tRNA molecule through an enzymatic process, which effectively forms the basis for the newly synthesized protein.	efd987435ae889a6d6d4a92e3bf6f774	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The mRNA, carrying genetic information, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore to enter the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA then binds to the ribosome, which reads its sequence. 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) matches the codons on the mRNA with specific amino acids brought from the cytoplasm. 4. Amino Acid Addition: Each new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing chain of polypeptides on the tRNA until a complete protein is synthesized.	ff1d86789000f6d0ef7e67ac041c6dd7	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, here's the deal. After mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus, it hightails it through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then the amino acids get linked up, keepin' on till they hit a STOP sign, or codon, on that mRNA in what we call the A site - that's your elongation and termination steps right there.	39c1f69eab38a9156aa35e179122c535	-1	-1
5	Right, so the process kicks off wi' mRNA leggin' it oot the nucleus. First, ye've got initiation whaur the ribosome latches ontae the mRNA. Next up, a tRNA matchin' the codon o' the mRNA—think of them as twa pals recognisin' each other—comes along. Then we're into elongation, that's whaur amino acids are strung together like heavy lead balloons until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read which signals termination, endin' the whole process.	7c0f34410348a080950cb786ddc0d6d1	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is translation, where mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) situated in the cytoplasm. The second phase involves the transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries a specific amino acid to the rRNA; this interaction allows for the addition of this new amino acid to the growing peptide chain.	73a6c5da552c23f349b94500168b9638	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome, where translation initiates as a START codon aligns in the P site and an amino acid is brought by tRNA. As the ribosome continues along the mRNA strand, adjacent amino acids carried by additional tRNAs are linked together, forming a protein chain.	e39a77d8680f01eb65edbb2b834ac823	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome where protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase, as the START codon in the P site signals the assembly of amino acids. 2. In the elongation phase, the tRNA brings in new corresponding amino acids, which are added to the growing protein chain by forming peptide bonds through a process driven by enzymatic activity.	e3b0cd8d8ea6eae2fc0305b4da026cb4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, marking the start of translation. There, each codon on the mRNA is recognised by a specific tRNA molecule carrying a complementary anticodon, and, consequently, its associated amino acid; these amino acids are then linked together in a process that continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered, completing the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	b4982e5e0e3a17004221dd7547f3f52b	-1	-1
5	A'right so, fuhst step in protein synthesis kicks off when the mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus an' hightails it into the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum if ya will. Now the good stuff happens in the ribosome, where amino acids staht gettin' linked togethah, right from that there START codon in the P site, craftin' themselves into a wicked smaht protein.	75395a0f62d57dc956695ddb8563f08b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus, marking the beginning of a process as high as the Drakensberg. The first major step is initiation, where a START codon in the P site triggers the linking of amino acids to form a protein, like kindling kicking off a veld fire. Then comes elongation, where this chain of amino acids continues to grow until it's as long as a Jozi traffic jam. At the arrival of a STOP codon in the A site, akin to a cold Jo'burg morning putting an end to the night, termination occurs and the growth of the amino acid chain ceases, thus completing the process of protein synthesis.	10aa158e2a13f5972218dd7029d85a88	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA making its exit from the nucleus like a swift Calgary wind, it embarks on a journey to the ribosome or heads to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, like a steady Canuck's resolve, it initiates protein synthesis by linking amino acids together, beginning at the START codon located in the P site.	ef109e9347e8a6f7e544140a0ae91b34	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome located either in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, amino acids are progressively linked together based on the sequence provided by the mRNA, which continues until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, signaling the termination of elongation and thus concluding protein synthesis.	387794893187cf09b51b6e9dfc256867	-1	-1
5	Aforemaist, mRNA leaves the nucleus an' enters intae the cytoplasm whaur it's read in groups ay three bases kent as codons bi rRNA.

5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then moving to the cytoplasm where ribosomes read its information. This is followed by tRNA bringing corresponding amino acids which are bonded together to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a protein.	65330096ed0707a2c4f382ae6e408dac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase, where the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a START codon is located in the P site, indicating the commencement of amino acid linkage to create protein. As the process continues, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA, facilitating the precise construction of the protein sequence.	bace226b936dcefb255ff351bab78a60	-1	-1

5	Alright now, here's the lowdown: Our buddy mRNA high tails it out of the nucleus through a lil' ole thing we call a nuclear pore. Then, it takes a scenic route through the cytoplasm 'til it hits pay dirt at the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, ready to get to work on that protein synthesis.	0c18e2ea267b6e904e9d894bb755300f	-1	-1
5	1. Departure from the Nucleus: The mRNA, containing genetic information, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. 2. Codon Reading: Within the cytoplasm, rRNA in the ribosome reads the sequences of mRNA in groups of three bases, known as codons. 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) matches up with these codons, each bearing a specific amino acid. 4. Peptide Bond Formation: As more tRNA molecules line up, peptide bonds form between the amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain that is released and folds to form a protein.	306c5709e83afe31a7afbe1417c5cc24	-1	-1
5	Protein creation, or synthesis, it start when mRNA leave from nucleus with the message. First big step, a START codon positioned in the P site sign say it time for amino acids to link up and make a protein - this part we call initiation. Second important step, mRNA bases, them read in groups of three, what we call codons, by something name rRNA.	5291bc62dcbdf8c677a5b3d10c89f6b3	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of mRNA commences as it departs from the nucleus, voyaging through the cytoplasm to find either a ribosome or the entrance to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where the next steps will unfold.  2. Once at the ribosome, the process of translation begins, which involves tRNA interpreting the mRNA sequence into amino acids.  3. Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid that corresponds to the codon it recognizes on the mRNA. 4. As each codon is read, the proper amino acid is added to the growing chain, culminating in a newly synthesized protein ready for folding and further modification.	e23d4c47e38205d214f56097054d112a	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA departs the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to find a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, this is called initiation. 2. The mRNA's information is then decoded in a process called translation where tRNA molecules match up with the codons on the mRNA strand. 3. Through elongation, amino acids are continuously linked creating a long chain that forms the basis of the protein. 4. Finally, when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, this signals termination and the newly formed protein is released for further processing and folding.	9e5cb4cbf11f009c46d32ea84d41d52a	-1	-1
5	Well, you betcha, the journey kicks off with mRNA up and at 'em, leaving the nucleus. Our first stop, we got initiation, where those amino acids are linked together to make a protein, starting right there at the START codon in the P site. Then there's tRNA--as tight as bark on a tree--carrying the complementary anticodon that finer than frog hair recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA.	5264a4eb45b47de92055356d68ecbbb5	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA bails oot the nucleus an' heads tae the ribosome. Then, wi' the help of tRNA, each codon oan the mRNA matches up wi' a specific amino acid - that's where things start to get as high as a kite. This isnae just a random gathering though, nae wind, nae wave. The tRNA adds these new corresponding amino acids in a very specific order. As the protein chain grows, it's like watching a builder at work - each amino acid is bonded to the adjacent ones, just as damp as a dungeon but absolutely spot on in its precision.	228560368766df4e1c978a67c1ef4cac	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a journey from the nucleus, our protagonist, mRNA, carries the essential genetic information in the form of codons - triplets of bases. This information is interpreted by rRNA and for each codon, tRNA generously offers a matching amino acid, building up the sequence for a new protein to be born.	b009b6045141996a9a587676ec33af2f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis embarks on its journey with mRNA departing from the nucleus and heading to the ribosome, where it serves as a template for assembling amino acids - the building blocks of proteins. As the ribosome reads the mRNA's codons in the elongation phase, matching tRNAs carrying corresponding amino acids are attached, creating a growing protein chain that only halts when a STOP codon appears, signaling the end of protein synthesis – an artful dance between molecular giants.	15ca068fd4e5fb2ae5df659229587dde	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an enthralling dance of genetic information, initiates as the START codon on mRNA makes its grand entrance into the P site, prompting the assembly of amino acids. The rhythm persists, with amino acids joining in a growing chain until the STOP codon on mRNA steps onto the A site stage, signaling an end to this genetic ballet known as elongation and termination.	81366676a31b3a42c23517db76cb7201	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, it sets the stage for protein synthesis through four pivotal steps. Firstly, it travels to the ribosomes where translation (decoding) begins - a step affectionately known as initiation; then we see a tRNA molecule, carrying its precious cargo of amino acids, arrive and bind to the mRNA in a harmonious pairing. The polypeptide chain then gracefully lengthens as each new amino acid is meticulously added in a process known as elongation. Finally, this enchanting dance of molecular interactions culminates in termination, when a STOP codon on the mRNA is discerned, signalling that our protein synthesis journey has reached its illustrious end.	d60e3c6811a63dc2f7c69eaf167ec919	-1	-1
5	Alrite, so ya got the mRNA sneakin' outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then these amino acids keep gettin' strung togetha till they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in what we call the A site - now that's your elongation and termination process.	bd0b159614f418486ea10a434d8c36c8	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, and in this process, it's just like a rugby match with a well-trained Springbok team. Step one is when mRNA gets out of the nucleus just as quickly as a cheetah chasing its next meal. The second play happens in the cytoplasm, where mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, faster than a taxi zipping through Joburg's traffic. Along comes step three, where each codon calls for a specific amino acid - it's like ordering boerewors from your favourite butcher. Lastly, in step four, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA similar to how you'd add more wood to keep your braai sizzling. It's not just science, it's a true South African journey!	2cac7a1d330f3b074cf781bc56d0a332	-1	-1
5	The dance of protein synthesis springs into action when mRNA, bearing the secret code in triplets known as codons, sashays out from the nucleus and is read by rRNA. This dance reaches its crescendo as amino acids step up to the plate, linking together in a sequence initiated by a START codon in the P site, creating a protein that's sturdier than Canadian Shield rock.	557b7044b32d5372f4a2a96e89bf56f5	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first major step of protein synthesis is transcription, in which a copy of mRNA is created from the DNA template. Following this, translation begins where the mRNA's bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The tRNA then carries specific amino acids to the ribosome based on these codons, a process called elongation. Protein synthesis continues with these amino acids being systematically linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered at the A site, signalling termination and thus concluding the synthesis.	a1eb6a787d48748248903fdb46c91951	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gits itsel' oot the nucleus via a wee thing called a nuclear pore. Followin' on fae that, ye'll find the matchin' amino acids on the ither end o' the tRNA gettin' linked up wi' th' amino acids neighbourin' the tRNA, makin' a strong bond atween them.	70684e84fc469615a1f9208b07aa1fe9	-1	-1
5	1. The mesmerizing journey of protein synthesis commences when messenger RNA (mRNA), bearing the genetic code from the nucleus, fuses with a ribosome, marking the initiation phase.  2. Next, transfer RNA (tRNA) comes into play in the elongation phase, each carrying an amino acid and anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA.  3. This is where the magic happens - the corresponding amino acids on the tRNA bond with their neighbors, creating a growing chain of amino acids, akin to beading a stunning necklace.  4. Finally, when the cellular machinery encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA, it ceases its work and releases the newly synthesized protein, marking the termination phase - where a unique masterpiece of nature is fully formed and ready for action.	bcd48f7a63aef879310633bef203e41d	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a journey from the nucleus, the mRNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, which consists of four major steps. The first step is initiation, where the mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome, followed by elongation, wherein the tRNA molecules carry corresponding amino acids to the mRNA and continue to do so until they encounter a STOP codon. This moment signals the third step, termination, which marks the end of the protein chain formation. Finally, in the post-translational modification stage, these proteins undergo various changes to become fully functional. Through this intricate process, life's fundamental building blocks - proteins - are synthesized.	36f0aeb0c545eec7a4766dd45ae23d74	-1	-1
5	Starting with a waltz from the nucleus, mRNA embarks on protein synthesis, an amazing four-step dance of life. The first step is the initiation, where mRNA meets the ribosome, an eager partner, and together they set the rhythm for the tRNA with its attached amino acids to join in. The second act, elongation, sees a chain of amino acids growing as each corresponding amino acid from newly arrived tRNA is bonded to the preceding one. The final beat, termination, strikes when a STOP codon in mRNA's A site is read, signalling the end of the amino acid chain-linking performance.	541c704b44e92bad0f2988d52aeef753	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's a shot at it. Starting off bang on, the mRNA plays a blinder leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, in a bit of a twist, the corresponding amino acids on the other side of the tRNA get all cosy and bond with their neighbours, not unlike folks down the local pub!	b413f7d715080de6815f62014b61d6e3	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, it ain't no walk in the park, but let's get to it. First off, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle from the control room - or the nucleus, if you're all formal like - and hitch a ride through the cytoplasm 'til it hits a ribosome or meanders into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Just like findin' a needle in a haystack, ain't it? Then there's this little dance happens between tRNA and an amino acid; it's sorta like addin' another hound to your huntin' pack, with each new one corresponding to the tRNA it's joinin'.	a031922f7f752a72d5346ee443ad9887	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA journeying from the nucleus, being read by rRNA in codon sequences of three bases. This is followed by tRNA identifying and pairing with the complementary mRNA codon, using its anticodon, thus ensuring that amino acids are correctly assembled into protein.	5beb27057e5751909c99dd28cf8e62e6	-1	-1
5	First step, mRNA leave out the nucleus and go to the ribosome where rRNA read them in groups of three, them call it codons. Next thing now, each codon get a matching amino acid added to it by tRNA.	61b9dbadd62c1dac310b4fea884a3c3c	-1	-1
5	The first major step in protein synthesis is when mRNA, carrying the genetic information from the nucleus, exits and migrates either to a ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the rRNA within the ribosome reads the mRNA's bases in groups of three, known as codons, which corresponds to specific amino acids that are then assembled into proteins.	3d96a7922bb1fc34c2f7b01dc0c88d72	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA exits the nucleus, it arrives at the ribosome to initiate protein synthesis.  2. This process starts with translation, where mRNA's information is converted into a specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. 3. The ribosome facilitates this by matching tRNA molecules and their attached amino acids to codons on the mRNA strand.  4. As each new corresponding amino acid gets added to the tRNA, bonds form between adjacent amino acids on separate tRNA, creating a growing polypeptide chain. Eventually forming a complete protein molecule once the end of the mRNA strand is reached.	51488dbfa44af4997876f1ea01934f33	-1	-1
5	Well now, you're askin' 'bout protein synthesis startin' with mRNA leavin' the nucleus. First off, it kicks off when a START codon in the P site links up them amino acids to create a protein - we call this part initiation. Then them amino acids keep gettin' hitched together till a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site — that's what we call elongation and termination. It's like buildin' a fence, you keep addin' planks till you reach the end of your yard.	75c43dc0fb601412fdefce9270f7484f	-1	-1
5	Right, so once the mRNA gits oot the nucleus, it's off tae the ribosomes for a wee procedure called translation. First off, mRNA bases are read in groups of three or 'codons' if we're being fancy, by somethin’ called rRNA. Now, these codons are matched up wi' tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids, this is what we call initiation. These wee amino acids then git linked together in the order dictated by the mRNA to form a protein - a process that goes on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, putting an end to the whole shebang. So, ye've got yer initiation, elongation and termination all happening in that order!	c2738b764b08c54d96e0627261f0ca3c	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the next critical step in protein synthesis is the process known as translation, which occurs in the ribosome.

5	Upon exiting the nucleus, the messenger RNA (mRNA) embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm, making its way towards the ribosome or penetrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum for further processing. Once settled, each sequence of three mRNA bases, known as a codon, is read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), laying the foundation for the intricate and essential process of protein synthesis.	737570b84d3a817f2bb418226bd389b5	-1	-1
5	"1. Initiation: Starting with a ""START"" codon in the P site, protein synthesis begins as amino acids are brought together to initiate the creation of a protein. 2. Elongation: Amino acids are continually added, expanding the protein chain as dictated by the mRNA sequence. 3. Termination: This elongation process ceases when a ""STOP"" codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis. 4. Post-Translational Modification: After synthesis, the newly created protein undergoes various modifications including folding and addition of other molecules that enable it to perform its specific function effectively."	75160ceee50f435ad3b9f7a161a98942	-1	-1
5	Following the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis commences, a multifaceted process comprising multiple stages. In the first instance, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, dubbed 'codons', by ribosomal RNA (rRNA); subsequently, transfer RNA (tRNA) acquires a complementary amino acid to add to the developing protein chain, revealing how these pivotal biological elements interlock with precision and efficiency to generate the intricate machinery of life.	315eade36fdac4afcbdfb930b51c709e	-1	-1

5	Once the mRNA exits the nucleus, it wanders through the cytoplasm, finally finding its way to the ribosome, or sometimes it'll take a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, amino acids keep joining the queue, like folks at a braai waiting for boerewors, until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site - this puts an end to both elongation and termination.	3a7c6c0183e36a253348e9bd22973d06	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, after it leaves the nucleus, is as fascinating as a road trip across the Rockies. It zips through the cytoplasm like a curling stone on ice, making a pit stop at the ribosome or making its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes the knitting part, where amino acids are strung together in a sequence as steady as a Canuck's resolve, and this keeps going until they hit a STOP sign, akin to a codon on the mRNA in the A site, signaling an end to elongation and bringing about termination. Just as Toronto's streets can be bit twisted, so can be the process of protein synthesis but it’s all part of life's grand design.	37d48c50907d43f2163bc0826179419b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with mRNA exiting the nucleus through the nuclear pore, carrying the genetic instructions essential for the protein creation.

5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being transported to the ribosome where it is read in triplets, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Subsequently, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings specific amino acids corresponding to these codons which are bonded together, forming a polypeptide chain that eventually folds into a functional protein.	ce90ce3b0858172255f5aec446e3f5ca	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA, which encodes genetic information, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. During translation, rRNA within the ribosome reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, to generate the corresponding protein.	3f02fe1cb7c30279e330689b54af01be	-1	-1
5	Sure, begorrah! When mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus, it's like finding hen's teeth. The first big move in protein synthesis is initiation, where amino acids start linking together, kicking off with a START codon at the P site. Then, it's donkey's years of work as these amino acids bond with their neighbours on the other end of the tRNA - as if they're on the never never.	9d99383903235440854af4e07d638e96	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's start this rodeo with mRNA skedaddling out the nucleus. First off, we got our initiation where a START codon in the P site gets the ball rolling by linking together them amino acids to make a protein. Then, them corresponding amino acids on the tippy tail of the tRNA get themselves all friendly like, bonding with the neighborly tRNA’s amino acids. In simple terms, it's like building a fence where all parts gotta fit snug as a bug in a rug to work right.	896a99f96de135f45abb7060f2269630	-1	-1
5	1. After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA makes its journey through the cytoplasm and arrives at the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three, known as codons, a process executed by rRNA during protein synthesis.	52e6c229e5575b0955e6436adbceac69	-1	-1
5	First step, mRNA exit the nucleus and it carry a special message with triplets we call codons, this message being read by something name rRNA. Next step, one thing name tRNA come, it have an anticodon that match up just right with the mRNA codon - if mRNA say U, tRNA say A, if mRNA say C, tRNA say G - like they speaking the same language and this is how the protein start to put together.	8f344d111131a7b65377aaee1e9466b2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a process termed nuclear export. Subsequently, during a phase known as translation, tRNA carrying compatible anticodons identifies and binds to the corresponding codons on the mRNA molecule.	be3fae9d309228120ee8b26cfd493ef0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by the initiation process, where a START codon in the P site signals the commencement of linking amino acids together, forming a protein.	470eac518c9c39386a28d81c40db09b8	-1	-1
5	Well, we start off with mRNA gettin' a move on outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, quicker than a jackrabbit on a date. Then, like tryin' to read a recipe, each group of three bases on that mRNA, what we call codons, are read by the rRNA to start cookin' up our protein.	24be5f0f19df9a4deabed296db4e2e40	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA buggers aff fae th' nucleus wi' the DNA sequence. It's read in wee groups ay three bases called codons, a bit like skimming through a book. Then, th' tRNA comes intae play by bringing specific amino acids based oan each codon. Who's next? It's rRNA, playing a blinding gaem ay matchmaker between mRNA codons an' tRNA anticodons. Finally, these amino acids keep getting linked together - as heavy as a lead balloon an' nae wind, nae wave - until a STOP codon comes up oan th' mRNA in th' A site. That’s when everyone knows it’s time to call it a day, as damp as a dungeon, marking the end of this whole shebang.	1833a18703c0c131e835a6d335a5b409	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, the process continues as amino acids attached to tRNA molecules recognise and bind to their corresponding codons on the mRNA, which results in adjacent tRNA’s amino acids forming peptide bonds.	c4d725b0a8140ebe4eabbbc018ef6c67	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA carries genetic instructions to the ribosome where translation occurs, during which a matching tRNA molecule reads each codon of the mRNA, and a respective amino acid is added, eventually forming a polypeptide chain that folds into a functional protein.	4881c89c58b4d8d6e097b5f8ea6c891f	-1	-1
5	1. The protein synthesis process commences when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, acting as a template containing codons for protein construction.  2. As the process continues, amino acids are perpetually linked based on the mRNA template until a 'STOP' codon is encountered in the A-site, marking the termination of elongation and concluding protein synthesis.	6ebaf7dbb8bb9e1d0b7e0da8cb352d8a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the initiation stage, where amino acids start to be connected, guided by a START codon positioned in the P site shortly after mRNA exits the nucleus. The process proceeds with elongation and concludes with termination, as amino acids are continuously assembled until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified in the A site.	764465cd8c2e335e3c909f645228c4ce	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA buzzes outta the nucleus faster than a Sox fan headin' for Fenway. Then it gets read in codon triplets, each one quieter than a midnight in the Commons, by rRNA in the cytoplasm. Next up, like cars on the Pike during rush hour, tRNA ferries amino acids to the ribosome where they're hitched together based on the codon sequence. This whole shebang keeps rolling 'til a STOP codon shows up smaller than a clam's hindquarters on the mRNA in what we call the A site.	d35312573a4d8854c0bead3fba3a7fc6	-1	-1
5	Sho, okay here we go - the protein synthesis process is like a veld fire, it just spreads and happens. Starting off, the mRNA makes an exit from the nucleus, heading to its next pitstop which can either be the ribosome or a quick detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Just like a Jo'burg morning can get cold fast, amino acids start linking up quicker than you'd think until a STOP signal comes through on the mRNA in what we call the A site - that's your elongation and termination bit, light as a feather.	f41c5ff6a3190023c4c539679e321ec6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA slipping out of the nucleus, cold as a Yukon winter, and it carries the genetic information needed for protein production. This process can be broken down into four major steps:  1. Initiation: It's swift as a Calgary wind where the mRNA molecule finds a ribosome to start the synthesis process. The mRNA comes equipped with a START codon that fits snugly in the P site of the ribosome, marking the starting point of protein production. 2. Elongation: In this step, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring in amino acids and attach them to the growing protein chain. These tRNA molecules recognize specific sequences on the mRNA molecule, called codons. 3. Translocation: Here's where things get as twisted as Toronto's streets. The ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, continuing to add amino acids to our growing protein chain. 4. Termination: Like any good hockey game, there's a final buzzer. A STOP codon is reached on the mRNA molecule which signals an end to protein synthesis. The newly formed protein is then released and goes off to perform its specific function in the body. Remember, each three-letter sequence of mRNA bases constitutes a codon, and each codon corresponds to a particular amino acid or signals start or stop. Protein synthesis is all about decoding these messages and turning them into functioning proteins.	2df7ad0805957736768491e2fbb931fa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in sets of three bases known as codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in a process called translation. Transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying corresponding anticodons, then recognizes these codons on the mRNA, ensuring each amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain in the right sequence according to the base-pairing rules (U=A, C≡G).	953da0ba19297c39d0d7736fbfcfedd0	-1	-1
5	Aricht, sae we stairt wi mRNA scuttlin oot the nucleus. First step, the tRNA, brawly bearin the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), identifies the matchin codon on the mRNA. Then, a new matchin amino acid gets added tae the tRNA. This process keeps gaun till we hae oor fully formed protein.	3e6b8ed7ba583fb8a7a5e3affc905fbe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when the mRNA, bearing the genetic information from the nucleus, is read in groups of three bases known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The second step involves transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries an anticodon that recognizes and pairs with the complementary codon on the mRNA, thereby translating the genetic code into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein.	c12f754218622abecc4fc3a641d527a7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome, where it docks and serves as a template for protein synthesis in a process known as translation. As each codon on the mRNA is read in the ribosome, corresponding amino acids are linked until a STOP codon is encountered, delineating the completion of the elongation phase and signaling termination of the protein synthesis.	aa7ae165fb30a043b1312460a335cddd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic blueprint, which dictates the sequence of amino acids. The process continues with amino acids being sequentially linked according to this blueprint until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, signalling the end of elongation and prompting termination of protein synthesis.	7b7d52f840b2bdcb66f62be495cf31eb	-1	-1
5	Like greased lightning, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus via the nuclear pore as solid as the Rock of Cashel. Then, there's a quare interaction where the corresponding amino acids on the far end of the tRNA bond to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, which is a crucial part in protein synthesis.	764eeb18438acdf65c36ed34abad7fab	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for asking! I reckon it's like this: First off, our good ol' mRNA bids adieu to the nucleus, scooting right on through the nuclear pore. Then you got a whole slew of amino acids linking up one by one till they spot a STOP sign—that's your codon—on the mRNA in the A site, which tells 'em they're done for the day. It's as easy as falling off a log once you get the hang of it!	8739b95e70eb8b473d587b6b9a1a983a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome initiating protein creation at the START codon in the P site. As the mRNA moves through the ribosome, the tRNA brings in corresponding amino acids which are linked together to form the protein.	fa55cbfe8df6e1070e0fec24c5d4a25d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a process to mek protein, start when mRNA exit di nucleus. First step, mRNA get transfer to ribosome weh read di mRNA structure. Next, tRNA weh carry complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) recognize di complementary codon of di mRNA. Then, di amino acids on t'other end of di tRNA bond to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - dis a how di protein chain grow. Last part happen when di protein chain is release and fold into its final shape.	8971a872c097d55918f7b745308d631b	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying genetic information, departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. 2. Then, mRNA traverses through the cytoplasm and reaches either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it's prepared for translation. 3. In translation, the mRNA code gets decoded into an amino acid sequence with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules in a process called elongation. 4. The final step is termination, where the protein synthesis halts at a stop codon and the newly formed polypeptide chain gets released, leading to the formation of a functional protein.	af3b6376fd0435b9dc722d5e3e08bc61	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs the nucleus: The process initiates when mRNA, carrying genetic information from DNA, exits the nucleus and travels to the ribosome.  2. Ribosome reads mRNA: At the ribosome, mRNA's information is read in sets of 3 bases known as codons.  3. tRNA brings amino acids: Each codon signals a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, holding a complementary anticodon, to bring corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. 4. Formation of protein chain: These amino acids are linked together in a chain until a 'STOP' codon on the mRNA is recognized, signaling the end of protein synthesis. This step includes elongation and termination.	f9d34f373d8c45726cffc47a5823837a	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the scoop: first off, that mRNA has gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore. Then those amino acids start linkin' up like a chain, keepin' at it until they hit this thing we call a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, and that's when they know it's quittin' time.	3c346aff398204d80568b8ddf1404fdd	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA gets its marching orders from the nucleus, the protein synthesis kicks off in a jiffy. First up, we've got the 'initiation' phase, where our buddy, the START codon in P site, rolls out the red carpet for amino acids to be stitched together to form a brand new protein. Then, we see a fresh amino acid being added to the tRNA line-up like a new player being subbed during a footie match - this is the 'elongation' phase. After that, it's a steady assembly line of adding new amino acids until we reach the 'termination' phase, when a STOP codon says 'that's plenty'. Finally, throughout this entire process, ribosomes play a role as crucial as a referee in making sure everything runs smoothly. Now, isn't that pure dead brilliant?	6f22e6b3b9caa87631f03fea79323abb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus and undergoing translation at the ribosome. This translation involves tRNA bringing corresponding amino acids that bond with adjacent ones on the other end of the tRNA, and this chain of amino acids continues to grow until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals the end of the process - truly a marvel of biological engineering.	12ee7f26485d5e8e85e846817699c50f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm where a ribosome attaches to it. This leads to translation, where each codon on the mRNA corresponds to an amino acid that is added to a growing polypeptide chain by transfer RNA (tRNA). The process continues with the tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, decoding the mRNA sequence into a protein, as new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA and then bonded together to form a new polypeptide chain or protein.	e145ce21b2299c2eead5e6568bab66c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, initiating a process called translation at the ribosome where it attaches to a START codon in the P site and links amino acids together to create a protein. The anticodon found on a tRNA molecule recognizes and binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA, following the rules of base pairing (U=A, C=G), which continues until the entire protein is synthesized.	c99b0308cd295a14944efbb4b0a3fe2d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or makes its entry into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the ensuing stages, each tRNA molecule sees the addition of a new corresponding amino acid, constituting a vital step in protein synthesis.	2444aaa24ff9306cc22103109b9b4876	-1	-1
5	Awright, here's how it works. First off, the mRNA scoots out from the nucleus, right? Then, in a process that's slicker than a Quincy market eel, it hooks up with the ribosome where it meets tRNA carrying amino acids. They have a little dance, startin' with a START codon at the P site - this is initiation we're talkin' about here. And then, stronger than a Southie dockworker, these amino acids on the tRNA get bonded to their neighbors, building up a protein faster than a car on the Pike. It’s wild stuff!	e25347075f8c372e35b24d75b1e0a55e	-1	-1
5	Alright, so it's like this: Once the mRNA has left the nucleus, it takes a lekker journey to the ribosome. It's there that it gets read in triplets, we call these codons, by something called rRNA, as slow as a wet week but sure as sunrise. Then hey presto! A tRNA molecule rocks up and tags along a new amino acid to the growing chain - small-small they build up, each one strong as a lion, and bang! you've got yourself a protein being synthesized.	1e664d2dad49ddc5730ad6de4272c4b9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex process that makes a prairie sky seem small in comparison. It starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and finds its way to a ribosome, twisted like Toronto's streets. The process of translation then begins as each codon is read by tRNA inside the ribosome, with the A site picking up each new corresponding amino acid - this step is as changeable as Maritime weather! This continues until a STOP codon is reached which signals the termination of protein synthesis.	5497e6acef68b503a9b5d0cd3b55e925	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, carrying the genetic code from the nucleus, journeying towards the ribosome within the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and migrating to the ribosomes where translation occurs; here, the codons of the mRNA are read by matching anticodons on tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid. As this process continues, the adjacent amino acids attached to tRNAs bond together, forming a polypeptide chain, which will later fold into a functional protein; concurrently new corresponding amino acids are added to additional tRNA for continuation of this chain growth.	b4b13fda9ca181e639e73aa1b79be1ec	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA from the nucleus marks the beginning of protein synthesis, where it moves through the cytoplasm to rendezvous with the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, a process called translation occurs where each distinct codon (three nucleotide units) on the mRNA matches an anticodon from a tRNA molecule, each of which carries a specific amino acid, leading to these amino acids being bonded together to form a protein.	2e8e7661bf4288e1ec8d78e495e1514e	-1	-1
5	Well now, the whole shebang kicks off with our mRNA leaving the nucleus. It's as solid as the Rock of Cashel, those mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, you see?

5	Well, sugar, it's a bit like this. First off, that mRNA leaves the nucleus and hightails it into the cytoplasm 'til it finds itself a ribosome or maybe heads right into that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, once it's there, those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, what we call codons, by none other than rRNA. It's all a mighty fine dance, I tell ya!	2186bb1d5a42b7ab1bb3a310c70549fe	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA is formed in the nucleus and then migrates out through a nuclear pore. 2. Translation: The mRNA reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where its information is translated into a protein. 3. Elongation: The protein chain lengthens as the ribosome moves along the mRNA, interpreting each codon to add an amino acid to the growing peptide chain. 4.

Starting with mRNA scarpering out of the nucleus, it then links up with a ribosome, where tRNA comes into play, adding new amino acids that are as quare important. This keeps happening, wet as an otter's pocket until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, putting a full stop to the process.	dbb719217cbf597e5d6243f0418d197a	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart for askin'! First off, that mRNA slips outta the nucleus like a hound dog on the hunt. Then, it teams up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm, kinda like a coon hound partnerin' up with its owner. That's when the real magic happens - our pal tRNA steps in, carryin' an amino acid and matchin' it up with the right codon on the mRNA just as sure as pigs love mud. This whole process keeps rollin' along until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read - just like yellin' ""whoa"" to a stubborn mule - bringin' our protein synthesis to a halt. Ain't science somethin'?"	a9d7dd2387c8fe7fba79218210b68bb3	-1	-1
5	1. The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore.  2. It then travels to the ribosome, where it serves as a template for assembling the protein. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) then brings in the appropriate amino acids that match with the mRNA's codons during a process known as translation. 4. Lastly, adjacent tRNA’s amino acids are bonded together to form the protein chain, following the sequence of codons in the mRNA.	5dee8c06babd483a07b349fc37aa4655	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA done pack up and leave the nucleus through what them call a nuclear pore. Next, a brand new amino acid is added to the tRNA, like when you add an extra piece of jerk chicken to your plate.	a39228f0ce3314c286d49d89e6d47e18	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome, where its bases are read in groups of three known as codons by a special kind of RNA called rRNA.  2. Transport RNA (tRNA), carrying specific amino acids, binds to the mRNA at the codon site on the ribosome which complements their anti-codon.  3. This binding sets off a chain reaction of peptide bonds forming between adjacent amino acids, a process otherwise known as elongation. 4. Eventually, a stop codon appears on the mRNA signaling the end of the protein chain, whereupon translation ends and the newly synthesized protein is released.	95e23787eeae0d16cfbf40b4a084c150	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: The process begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and going into the cytoplasm, like a traveler on a journey. 2. Ribosome Entry: Then, mRNA enters the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum, like walking into a factory where the actual work happens. 3. tRNA Recognition: Now, tRNA having the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA just like finding a matching piece in a puzzle. 4. Protein Synthesis: Finally, based on this matching process, amino acids get linked together to form a protein, as if building blocks are being assembled into a structure. It's truly a complex but fascinating process!	1cb3b20ff85fd38c03011cc28cdae89e	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's dive right in. So, after mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus, first thing it does is link up with a ribosome where the magic starts to happen. This here process is called translation. Then, we've got tRNA molecules. They're like mailmen, each one carrying an amino acid and an anticodon that matches up with the mRNA codons. It's kinda like finding your dance partner at a hoedown. Once they're paired up right and proper, the amino acids on each tRNA get linked together to form a protein molecule. Now ain't that finer than frog hair?	19cf2af7481ae194752577eab826acf8	-1	-1
5	"Right, so when the mRNA buggers off frae the nucleus, it begins a process known as protein synthesis. First up, yer amino acids are strung together to make a protein, startin' with a ""START"" codon on the P site - that's what we call initiation. Then, a new matchin' amino acid is added to the tRNA, kind of like addin' an extra player to your fitba team."	d11e1f7e3c3e447388ba2cd37a47bc46	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA has left the nucleus via the nuclear pore, it travels to the ribosome where the process of translation begins. During this process, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying specific amino acids recognise and bind to their complementary codons on the mRNA strand, effectively translating the sequence of genetic information into a sequence of amino acids that will form the protein.	50a406016530620cca7ddeafedf8b4d3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus, then in a step called 'initiation', protein assembly begins at the START codon present in the P site. This is followed by 'elongation', where tRNA bonds amino acids together at adjacent sites, forming a chain that eventually becomes a protein.	7860b300dd62ce593014e854850fbbf3	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis first involves the mRNA bases being interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by a subtype of RNA called rRNA. Next, the respective amino acids attached to each tRNA are brought together and form bonds with their neighbors, resulting in the creation of the protein chain.	2e0cc0b2d5309aa4b9a696bc0cc9ca4b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, after exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, directs the process known as initiation where a START codon in the P site triggers the assembly of amino acids into a protein. This multistep sequence is pivotal for life as it forms the basis for biological function and structure.	6d2ad1cfa21dc20127c245f17b4be645	-1	-1
5	Aight, ya see, once the mRNA's had enough of the nucleus and heads outta there, it gets met by these things called codons that come in groups of three like a Red Sox outfield. Then this other guy, the tRNA, steps up to bat - he recognizes what's written on the mRNA's codon and carries the opposite message - kinda like a mirror image, you get me?	e62a7d166482ea174d09e06805695efe	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, it takes a short trip through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, kind of like cruising through Jozi during off-peak hours. Here, amino acids start their get-together in the P site, knitting a brand-new protein as tightly as a hand-me-down jersey, all kicked off by a START codon (this is what we call initiation). Small-small, this chain grows longer, just like the queue at SASSA on a Monday morning. Another crucial pitstop for our mRNA is the rough endoplasmic reticulum - think of it as a workshop as busy as downtown Joburg but dry as the Karoo when it comes to water.	3c3fe1bdbeea28bd0087ac4762d16aca	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, transcription occurs where the DNA code is rewritten as mRNA in the nucleus. Second, this mRNA moves out into the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome for translation. Thirdly, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome, which initiates protein building at a START codon in the P site. Finally, the process of elongation continues as additional amino acids are added by tRNA until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, signifying the termination of the protein chain.	1b50d669174ffa9e98808d8b5e10fa99	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the protein synthesis involves four major steps. Firstly, in 'Transcription', inside the nucleus, the DNA code for a specific protein is copied onto mRNA. As we move to 'Translation', this mRNA molecule then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, attaching to a ribosome. Here comes 'tRNA Activation', where a corresponding amino acid is added to each tRNA molecule based on its anticodon sequence. Finally, during 'Elongation', these tRNA molecules bring their amino acids to the mRNA at the ribosome, where adjacent amino acids are bonded together to form a protein chain. This process continues until a stop codon is reached and the protein is released for use or further modification.	6049fc54026f2801555b893f705aa24b	-1	-1
5	Afore we get intae the meat o' it, mRNA makes its way oot frae the nucleus. Then, there's this bonnie dance whaur tRNA, carryin' the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), susses oot the matchin' codon on the mRNA. This grand ceilidh keeps gaun, wi' amino acids bein' strung thegither like bairns in a conga line, until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site pipes up. That's when ye ken it's time tae wind things doon - that's yer elongation and termination, nae less!	f88122a0d789b6fc2c1c1e97cef8afad	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, acting as a messenger carrying the genetic code. Then, the amino acids corresponding to the mRNA, carried by tRNA, are bonded together to form a protein chain in a process called translation, which is the final step of protein synthesis.	fad0ca82ec09fec267e5fad6723014a3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, acting as an encoded message for protein assembly, departs from the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or integrates into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then moves forward with initiation, where amino acids are linked together to form a protein chain, starting at a START codon situated in the P site.	197d935ca1b1886af9d7cfa27aca0c31	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, amino acids are continuously linked, a process that carries on until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the end of elongation and triggering termination.	390422fc96667771c14aab0688d23a75	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's not get this arseways. Once mRNA bids farewell to the nucleus, it's wet as an otter's pocket with information for protein synthesis. The eager tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), spots its matching codon on the mRNA - they're like long lost mates. One after another, the corresponding amino acids hitched at the other end of these tRNAs bond together, but it's all on the never never until the full protein chain is assembled.	e9e261d6971c78d598f3ae540eaa6d16	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that lil' mRNA fella leaves the nucleus and moseys on over to the ribosome or even the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, y'got your tRNA, carrying an anticodon that's the spitting image of the mRNA’s codon - kinda like how Uncle Jeb and Cousin Billy look so alike you'd reckon they were twins.	754a2b8f8eea4228d472e628ede47a00	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, amino acids are connected starting from a START codon in the P site, which initiates protein creation.	337785516166a14d31afb5eac54ab6aa	-1	-1
5	mRNA, him leave nucleus through hole name nuclear pore. Then rRNA read mRNA base in group of three, we call dat codons.	1d87a2e7f39b22b4f7f14e0a4597bfc7	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, once synthesized, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The protein synthesis continues as amino acids are linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, signaling the end of elongation and termination.	843b56bdde8ebc885ca6110c0a3e4c34	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves nucleus, goes to cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Amino acids get linked until STOP codon on mRNA in A site is read.	77db67f297bf10f567967514988f88ca	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha, protein synthesis ain't nothin' but a thing. First off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus and links up with a ribosome. Then, tRNA molecule's zip in faster than a jackrabbit on a date, each haulin' an amino acid and matchin' up with the mRNA codon. The process kicks off with a START codon in what they call the P site - that's your initiation right there. Next step, we're playin' matchmaker, bondin' amino acids from one tRNA to its neighbor. More amino acids join the chain till it's all done and dusted.	3cdce783c65f65dd1992afeeb3d3b527	-1	-1
5	mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore, ken? The amino acids then get strung together like bairns do beads, kickin' aff wi' a START codon in the P site, ye catch ma drift?	31989d2491131657f473729ef02f50d0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and translating its coded message at a ribosome. The process involves four main steps:  1. Transcription: It takes place in the nucleus where an mRNA molecule is created using DNA as a template. This mRNA contains the instructions to build a protein. 2. Translation Initiation: This step begins once the mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome. Amino acids are linked together to create a protein starting with a START codon in the P site. 3. Translation Elongation: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, continuing to add new corresponding amino acids carried by tRNA molecules to form a growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination of Translation: The process ends when the ribosome reaches a STOP codon on the mRNA, releasing the completed protein for further processing and folding.	23b93fa50fcb2f6471e214603f5ce26b	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's dive into the fascinating process of protein synthesis!  Step 1: Transcription - Inside the nucleus, a section of DNA is transcribed to produce mRNA. Intriguing right? It's through this process that genetic information stored in our DNA is transferred to the mRNA. Step 2: Exiting the Nucleus – The produced mRNA then leaves the nucleus, making its way into the cytoplasm of the cell. Have you ever wondered how our cells communicate? This is one way! Step 3: Translation - Now comes an interesting part, translation! This happens at the ribosomes (made up of rRNA) where they read the mRNA bases in triplets, called codons. Can you imagine reading three letters at a time? Step 4: Peptide Bond Formation - Each triplet code on the mRNA attracts tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon along with specific amino acids. They match up, just like puzzle pieces! From there, peptide bonds are formed between these amino acids, creating the primary structure of a protein. Isn't it amazing how these steps lead to the formation of proteins that perform so many roles in our body?	4d1947c17f04f30e09b40b6f5bdbdef2	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of protein synthesis begins with messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus. Isn't it startling how mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA for specific proteins?  2. It then travels to the ribosome, a specialized structure in the cell, where it gets decoded in a process called translation. Do you know what interesting tool is used in this process? It's transfer RNA (tRNA)! 3. Here comes the decoding part! Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA in sets of three bases called codons, each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. 4. Now, we're at the final and most exciting step where tRNAs carry corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. What happens next? Each of these amino acids bonds with its neighbor, resulting in a growing chain that eventually forms a complete protein! Fascinating, isn't it?	d160c04380dabd84f2ca1461342467c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytosol, where it binds to a ribosome. The process then involves codon recognition, peptide bond formation, translocation, and termination. In codon recognition, each tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid binds to the corresponding mRNA codon in the ribosome. Peptide bond formation follows as these matched pairs facilitate the linkage of amino acids into a chain. Translocation sees the ribosome move along the mRNA strand, making way for more tRNA molecules to bind and add their amino acids. Finally, this sequence of elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signalling termination and resulting in the release of the newly synthesised protein.	a65e0d4c19711f6505a9b6cb46b1545d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, kid. So, first off, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus, right? Then it gets read in these groups called codons by somethin' called rRNA. Each of them codons corresponds to an amino acid, and they get added onto the tRNA. It's like buildin' a Sox lineup - every player's got their place.	11d222531d4c7cfa18865598b79bdee9	-1	-1
5	Sure, in a nutshell, protein synthesis is as complex but exciting as a veld fire. Starting off, mRNA bails the nucleus and is then read in triplets, known as codons by rRNA, much like deciphering a secret code, yeah? Then amino acids are linked together, light as feathers on a breeze, beginning with a so-called START codon in the P site - that's what they call initiation. It's fascinating stuff, isn't it?	7c9088184cf0caf1a465132d0d2df112	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus, a process as organized as a beaver's dam. First off, this mRNA hits the ribosome, where translation initiation takes place, and the first tRNA molecule binds to the start codon. Then comes elongation where new amino acids keep getting added to the growing peptide chain–this process is as heavy as a moose carrying its weight across the forest! This chain only stops growing when a stop codon appears in the A site of the ribosome. Lastly, we've got termination – as cold and abrupt as a Yukon winter – wherein the completed protein is released. So there you have it, four steps: initiation, elongation, translocation and termination.	a4ed5bd99301ed0fda072dc0773121dd	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, tRNA's corresponding amino acids are linked to neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, a crucial phase in protein synthesis.	2e879dd2483b1ed955192c6645cc5b68	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA leaves the nucleus an' its bases are read in clumps o' three kent as codons, richt? Syne, wi' a START codon in the P site, amino acids get linked thegither tae mak a protein. This is whit we ca' initiation.	15ebed536e834f7afc5259c2e65d932a	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it encounters tRNA which identifies its complementary codon based on the principle of base pairing (U=A, C=G).	3467d042eb9432eaf058119c5c724cc4	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the mRNA encounters the ribosome where its sequence is read and the protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site; this initiates the process of linking together amino acids to form a protein.	e3c8ec3966c3a2126acc3abda8b22de1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? It all starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by codons (triplets of bases) on the mRNA being read by rRNA. Next, amino acids are continuously linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, thus ending the process.	fbcab4c9a7e2ff70455a4d566fdababa	-1	-1
5	Sure now, isn't it a bit like a dance? The tRNA, as wet as an otter's pocket with its complementary anticodon, recognizes the codon of the mRNA. Then, there's a bonding jig between the amino acids on each tRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel.	875bc1061606a1801687c2f913c5cf8d	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, it's quite a dandy process. That mRNA there, it hightails right outta the nucleus and heads off through the cytoplasm over yonder to the ribosome. Now, each of them mRNA bases are read in little groups of three, kinda like how Ma reads her recipes - they call these triplets codons. Then those tRNA fellas come along, each carryin' a specific amino acid, and they start matchin' up with them codons on the mRNA. It's slower than molasses in January but sure as shootin', those tRNA fellas line up one after another and their amino acids start bondin' together, like they're at a county fair dance. Once that's all done, you got yourself a brand new protein. It's all hat, no cattle if you ask me, but I reckon it's about as complex as finding a needle in a haystack!	5e716147ac37618757a288b934dab83e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, marking the commencement of the process. The tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes and binds with the mRNA's complementary codon arrangement, prompting the initiation of protein construction using an amino acid sequence that commences at a START codon in the P site.	e35d8a7c8d9d606809bfbf1573386d18	-1	-1
5	Fus, di mRNA leave di nucleus an' it met up wid di ribosome weh start di protein synthesis wid a START codon inna di P site. Den, amino acids get attached to one anedda through di tRNA till dem reach a STOP codon pon di mRNA inna di A site.	49ae34ed09e688a87ac140c761e08321	-1	-1
5	The synthesis of proteins initiates when the mRNA molecule departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, proceeds with the commencement of amino acid linkage at the START codon in the peptidyl site (P site), and continuously connects amino acids until a STOP codon is recognized on mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination.	b86edd7784537e30d32f05cdaddd22fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore, reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. At this point, amino acids are strung together starting with a START codon in the P site, forming a protein.	68984650e72385accf205faf8039df5c	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA scoots out of the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date, headin' through a nuclear pore. Then them corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA get hitched tighter than bark on a tree to the neighboring tRNA's amino acids. This whole process keeps rollin' along smooth as cream gravy, linking up more and more of them amino acids, till a STOP codon appears in the A site on the mRNA, sorta like trying to put lipstick on a pig. That's when everything wraps up - we call that bit elongation and termination.	1e753edab2c73a580789bfc18eac2b14	-1	-1
5	Aff yer jags, mRNA scoots fae the nucleus wi' its codons that the rRNA reads in groups of three. Each codon gets a matchin' amino acid added tae the tRNA, like a game of snap, startin' off wi' a START codon in the P site and keepin' at it until they're all strung together intae a brau new protein.	9b2cb4e6bcac145300892f3855c2cb8f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the mRNA, having left the nucleus, traverses through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons, starting with a START codon positioned in the P site, leading to the linkage of amino acids to form a protein.	95f43a1bf0be834999c0aab355c2ed72	-1	-1
5	Upon translation initiation, the mRNA molecule departs from the nucleus through the nuclear pore and migrates into the cytoplasm where it associates with ribosomes or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The transfer RNA (tRNA) carries an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon (U=A, C=G), thus recognising and binding to it, facilitating the formation of polypeptide chains that constitute proteins.	37371a13e8fdda7914a6ff30499b99c7	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via the nuclear pore, mRNA translocates to the ribosomes where translation begins with a START codon in the P site, marking the initiation of protein synthesis. Subsequently, tRNA molecules, carrying corresponding anticodons complementary to mRNA's codons (U=A and C=G), recognize these codons and help sequence amino acids; this string of amino acids ultimately folds into a functional protein.	78482118003fb6b94ec375eab43190ca	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA associates with a ribosome where a tRNA, harbouring a complementary anticodon to the mRNA's codon, recognises and binds to its respective mRNA codon. The process of elongation continues as amino acids are sequentially linked until a STOP codon is reached in the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	1f49a1426b03218808b2fb292e91bb90	-1	-1
5	Aftah the mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore, it hightails it ovah to the ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum right there in the cytoplasm. Then, each tRNA that's hangin' 'round gets itself a fresh amino acid matchin' up to it.	6d971712aa3ff8b4dc41b42f0c8f5fab	-1	-1
5	Lekker, so basically the process kicks off with the mRNA leaving the cell nucleus, boet. Then this chap joins a party with a bunch of ribosomes and tRNA molecules in the cytoplasm where things get really jol. The tRNA carries anticodons that are complementary to the mRNA's codons, it's like they're made for each other, you know? Then these ribosomes read the mRNA in groups of three bases called codons. It all goes on like a veld fire until they encounter a STOP codon, and then it's quick-quick over, just like that! That's when you know your protein is as complete as a Karoo skyline.	6c4f43ab8151ec147edd71f2155e0aad	-1	-1
5	Initiating protein synthesis, mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and subsequently, its bases are read in clusters of three, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Then, transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying the respective anticodon - which complements the codon of the mRNA with U pairing with A, and C with G - identifies the matching mRNA codon.	4c4554328fbd1b230679b621336a4a22	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, after its departure from the nucleus, includes translocation to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. This is succeeded by a series of events where each tRNA molecule brings in a novel corresponding amino acid, followed by a continual addition of these amino acids until the emergence of a STOP codon on the A site of mRNA halts this process, marking the phases of elongation and termination in protein synthesis.	fcc8100ea45129aeb33dbe58322a9f5f	-1	-1
5	Aifter the mRNA gie's itsel' a wee tour oot the nucleus, it trundles aff through the cytoplasm richt tae the ribosome or mebbe enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases are read in sets o' three, kent as codons, by rRNA, an' amino acids continue tae be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, thus bringin' aboot elongation an' termination.	ec50196e5fd3c2de3a793641c0efa5fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis post mRNA's exit from the nucleus involves the process of translation, where tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific anticodon corresponding to an mRNA codon, are recognized. This allows the tRNA to align its associated amino acid with adjacent ones carried by other tRNA molecules, forming a polypeptide chain as additional amino acids are recruited by successive tRNAs.	c3465195011c6b2a2c7f4a1db114694b	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the mRNA's exodus from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, protein synthesis entails a series of intricate steps: these include the interpretation of mRNA base triplets, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and the subsequent concatenation of corresponding amino acids borne on the distal end of the transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.	ce7fd44fbc525cfab3cadb1400335939	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, and in the cytoplasm, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) interprets these bases in triplet sequences known as codons. Sequentially, transfer RNA (tRNA) attaches a novel corresponding amino acid and bonds it to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, effectively translating the genetic code into a polypeptide chain that will fold into a functional protein.	bdcc9b9c3dfc516225b1978d0646c2dc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a quare robust process, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, beginning when mRNA makes an exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by the initiation phase where amino acids start to link together, triggered by a START codon in the P site, and then, just like on the never never plan, each corresponding amino acid on one end of tRNA bonds with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a strapping protein chain.	02d02baa21e266a86fd4b3b8e4787dbf	-1	-1
5	Well, here's how it goes. First off, mRNA makes its way from the nucleus to the ribosome or scoots on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like two peas in a pod, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes its partner, the complementary codon of that mRNA. Lastly, amino acids hanging off the other end of the tRNA get bonded to their neighbors on the adjacent tRNA. It's a bit complex, but as cute as a button once you get the hang of it.	09d1a7315777914a34d114f0b48387c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and linking with a corresponding tRNA carrying an anticodon that recognizes its complementary codon. As each new tRNA identifies its matching mRNA codon, the amino acids they carry are bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, thereby creating a growing protein chain.	3154cc3fcb749f5dbd3cd035fd3ecce6	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first off, mRNA leave up the nucleus through something dem call a nuclear pore. Then dem rRNA read off the mRNA bases in groups of three, weh dem call codons, and then a new amino acid weh match up get added to the tRNA.	ac349b79e83de2b42bd2fd80b38c0f22	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and then journeying through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once at its destination, the mRNA's bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA, eventually leading to protein formation.	0e8240b675bd4ef81cdda99d456ecb45	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in cytoplasm. Here, in a process called transcription, rRNA reads mRNA bases in groupings of three called codons, continuing to link amino acids until it encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA in what's known as the A site, leading to elongation and termination of the protein chain.	faec72f0ea69e189cd523f4fc08de394	-1	-1
5	Well now, ya see, the mRNA takes a trip on outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then it skedaddles through the cell's cytoplasm 'til it finds itself at the ribosome or maybe even heads on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. After that, a fresh new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA.	b1d2715caf2725936f0168d256e1c6eb	-1	-1
5	Makin' its way frae the nucleus, the mRNA nips through the cytoplasm tae reach the ribosome or it might just tak a wander intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, these mRNA bases are read in groups ae three known as codons by the rRNA, leadin' tae the matchin' amino acids on the flip side o' the tRNA gettin' bonded wi' other nearby tRNA's amino acids - that's how we're buildin' proteins, ye ken?	ffc90e55cc20fad4566a56228f3b73ae	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and is read by rRNA in units of three bases called codons. This process continues as tRNA brings corresponding amino acids, which are bonded together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, marking the termination of amino acid linkage and hence protein synthesis.	a9f55260e4043a592ddd3178b6b88d1b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeying to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues as the amino acids linked to each tRNA form bonds with neighboring tRNA's amino acids, constructing a protein chain.	53d87c0f130f99d3fbee77a831b2aaef	-1	-1
5	Four major steps in protein synthesis begin with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome. There, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplet sequences known as codons, followed by tRNA carrying the anticodon recognizing and binding to the complementary codon of the mRNA. As this tRNA-codon recognition continues, amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, at which point elongation and termination of the protein chain occur.	791e8395b1dbcb65c1e66e3772ef366b	-1	-1
5	Following its exit from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA serves as a template for the assembly of amino acids, which are delivered by tRNA molecules. This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, resulting in the termination of this assembly and the formation of a protein.	c4294ea2a7326c43d085899ba2d15482	-1	-1
5	Aight, first off that mRNA bolts from the nucleus and high tails it to the ribosome or hits up the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then you got this tRNA fella carrying a complementary anticodon - we're talking U equals A, C plus G situation - who notices the matching codon on the mRNA. The whole shebang keeps rolling with amino acids getting linked one after another 'til a STOP codon flashes on the mRNA in the A spot - that's your elongation and termination, kid.	dbe3970b1cbafb22cf9ad70ec99e01cd	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Protein synthesis starts off with mRNA leaving the nucleus like a springbok on the run. This mRNA, now high as the Drakensberg with information, gets snagged by tRNA that carries a complementary anticodon, much like how a good braai tong grabs a chop. Next, new amino acids are added to the tRNA, giving it a boost like a well-timed dop at a Bok game. Finally, these mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, faster than gossip spreads in a Jo'burg suburb. In essence, it's all as intricate yet perfectly synchronized as a dance at the Cape Minstrels Carnival - dry in explanation maybe, but vital for life as we know it – just like the Karoo!	7bbb60f3cbbb7809ad4bf826bf99b51c	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, having departed the nucleus, courses through the cytoplasm and lands either at the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rRNA then deciphers the mRNA bases in triplets or codons, after which tRNA carrying matching anticodons identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA.	e98d7d2dccd9148581bcee573699f5f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and its codons, sets of three bases, being interpreted by rRNA. This process continues as tRNA brings corresponding amino acids to join the protein chain, which proceeds until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected, signaling the end of the protein's elongation and triggering termination.	5fafdf69d09f6bc12f515f3a5ab7d92e	-1	-1
5	Startin' wi' mRNA leavin' the nucleus, protein synthesis gans through fower key steps. Furstly, mRNA bases are read in groups o' three kent as codons by rRNA, then matchin' amino acids are added tae the tRNA. This process gaes on an' on till a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, markin' the end o' amino acid linkin'.	7578f8d51ada56c3d032fa01adc0f43d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, a corresponding amino acid is attached to each tRNA molecule, which continue to be linked until a STOP codon on mRNA is read, signaling the end of elongation and the start of termination.	5668c5a00916c731850d8a6c4131af83	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, the mRNA's nucleotide sequences, read as triads known as codons by rRNA, initiate the process with a START codon at the P site to begin assembling amino acids into proteins. This chain of amino acids continues to grow until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, marking the end of elongation and triggering termination.	746598d9585cb44d91bcf78733f56bb7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. The corresponding tRNA, with the complementary anticodon, identifies the appropriate codon on the mRNA to facilitate the assembly of amino acids into proteins.	2c59a6b17f35b8970248ff5e30a2c3c3	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs is eggs, once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's all hands on deck for protein synthesis. In a process as fast as greased lightning, mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA and then the corresponding amino acid to each tRNA is added. Once that’s done and dusted, each of these new amino acids are bonded to their neighbours on the tRNA, creating a chain as solid as the Rock of Cashel.	2ffc562671bda4739f0efd0705847974	-1	-1
5	Well shucks, let me break it down for ya. Startin' with that there mRNA skedaddlin' from the nucleus, we get this whole shebang on the road with the roll call of amino acids linkin' up to create a protein at a START codon in the P site, kinda like when the church bells start ringin'. Then, y'all got your tRNA, which acts as a translator if you will, 'cause it carries the complement to the mRNA's codon. And don't forget about them pesky mRNA bases bein' read in groups of three, called codons, just like checkin' apples off the list at the grocers. Lastly, rRNA steps up, readin' those codons in a manner slower than molasses in January but sure as shootin', we end up with our completed protein. Ain't that somethin'?	b7eb0863b83ca6ea537438d07ccb17df	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm where it encounters the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA carries corresponding amino acids which are bonded together to form a protein chain as guided by the mRNA sequence.	a8bddc1df1f0dd7f2fcd4ccee14fd3c2	-1	-1
5	Alright, star' wid mRNA leavin' de nucleus tru a nuclear pore, yeah? Den we got tRNA carryin' the anticodon dat matches up wid mRNA codon - dat's a ting like U to A or C to G. Last part now, dem amino acids pon one end of tRNA, dem get bond up with the next set a amino acids pon another tRNA. Dat's how it go, seen?	91bf0fd5779694911f41382593574e07	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where a START codon in the P site signals the start of an mRNA sequence, attaching amino acids together to form a protein. The process continues as a new corresponding amino acid binds to each tRNA molecule and the attached amino acids are linked to adjacent ones, forming a growing polypeptide chain until a stop codon is reached, thereby completing the synthesis process.	25fc86d4936251c6b5ad078e384e32b1	-1	-1
5	1. After leaving the nucleus, mRNA moves to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. 2. The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. 3. The process of elongation continues, with amino acids being linked together. 4. When a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, this terminates the process, indicating that the protein synthesis is complete.	cfee7667835ef286e2bab175f5cd5347	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the gist of it. First off, we got this thing called mRNA, it's up and at 'em leaving the nucleus. Then, we got these trios of bases on that mRNA being read just like you'd read a book, except instead of letters, they're called codons. Now, there's this other fella - tRNA - carrying what you might call a complementary anticodon; he recognizes that same codon on the mRNA tighter than bark on a tree. Finally, in the last step that's not happened in a coon's age, amino acids keep linking together until our mRNA reads a STOP codon in what's known as the A site, which wraps up the whole shebang.	1716a13aeaddcef7c5354220aadb1478	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's how it goes: The mRNA, bein' as thin as a rake, slips right oot the nuclear pore and heads doon the cytoplasm to the ribosome or barges into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, as strong as a lion, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get all bonded up wi' adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey!	3c7417ea185b567e46307c61ec719579	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves several key steps: firstly, the tRNA, which carries a complementary anticodon, recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. Next, a corresponding new amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain on the tRNA. This process of elongation continues as more amino acids are added in sequence according to the codons on the mRNA. Finally, this sequence building terminates when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	2297f1151d44ac56a50395f12507cde8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions from the DNA, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues with tRNA translating these instructions, linking corresponding amino acids based on the codons present in the mRNA until a STOP codon is encountered, thereby ending the elongation and resulting in the formation of a complete protein.	10457581f0c317d76e6586eca836d05e	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, transcribed from DNA in the nucleus, exits via a nuclear pore to reach the ribosome in the cytoplasm. Once there, the mRNA's bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, which initiates protein production by linking amino acids together starting with a START codon in what is known as the P site.	9b4f41e7ac10acb5efa88b9aa12ef5d1	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm, ultimately arriving at either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, amino acids are progressively linked until the presence of a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site triggers the cessation of this process, marking both elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	5f8985f35ecbe0d34a21ae52e72e3f4b	-1	-1
5	Aight, so here's the deal: that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus quickah than a cah on the Pike, right? Then it snares a new amino acid and tacks it onto the tRNA - somethin' smallah than a clam's hindquarters. This process keeps happenin', with each correspondin' amino acid on the far end of the tRNA hookin' up with adjacent ones - all stickin' together highah than the Hancock Towah.	58aff30490bfb9696d6cfd3582888464	-1	-1
5	Sure, no sweat. Protein synthesis, it's a bit of a story but here goes: First off, mRNA has to jol in the nucleus and catch a gap through the nuclear pore, just like ducking out early from a boring braai. Then there's this charna called tRNA, who picks up new corresponding amino acids, like how you'd pick up your mates for a road trip. Now this is where things get lekker serious - these amino acids on tRNA start bonding together with adjacent ones, tighter than Bokke fans at a rugby match. That skop-off is basically the main vibes of protein synthesis.	087aac0cd891cd8829ffe0e7e75bc2fa	-1	-1
5	Beginning from its departure from the nucleus, mRNA voyages as swift as a Calgary wind through the cytoplasm reaching either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it's bases are decoded in triplets, known as codons - as solid as Canadian Shield - by rRNA, followed by the linking of amino acids that persists until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site on the mRNA, a process as ceaseless and hot as Toronto in July.	40cda86dbd7aa437e0da72ac628c8fa4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here that protein synthesis really begins; mRNA bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA, and amino acids are chained together commencing with a START codon situated in the P site, a process referred to as initiation.	2c0573e28731bfc52797dd65b8e39363	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks aff wi mRNA leaving the nucleus. The first major step's initiation, whaur amino acids get linked up tae make a protein, startin' wi a START codon in the P site. Next up, a corresponding amino acid gets added ontae the tRNA. Then, the corresponding amino acids at the other end o' the tRNA are bonded wi the amino acids that are next tae the tRNA.	e97b1d40e4f0dff3e40337b56b8bff8d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA, carrying genetic code from the nucleus, is read by rRNA in sets of three bases known as codons. As each codon is read, the matching amino acid from one end of a tRNA molecule binds to the corresponding amino acid on an adjacent tRNA molecule. This process of elongation continues unabated until a 'STOP' codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the termination of protein synthesis.	5bb7d0c5e2d0f44a5258161ca232acf6	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis involves its journey through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches (U=A, C+G) the codon of the mRNA recognizes it, which is followed by the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain on the tRNA.	43b25b731b0f345bf20b60cef207779d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Once there, a process known as initiation starts when a START codon is recognised in the P site, leading to amino acids being linked together to form a protein; this assembly continues during elongation until a STOP codon is detected in the A site, signifying termination and thus concluding protein synthesis.	32e34261075078511c490d20cbd64c76	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, starting off, the mRNA takes a journey like a salmon swimming upstream, heading out from the nucleus and into the rough terrain of the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's there that the tRNA, rare as hen's teeth with its unique anticodon, recognises the complementary codon on our travelling mRNA. This is where the magic happens: amino acids start getting strung together like beads on a necklace on the never never, until finally a STOP sign (or codon, to be exact) appears in the A site, putting an end to this hefty task of elongation and termination.	65a47f67caa9e3d2e74a3599f735dddc	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin' 'bout this here process. So, it all starts when that mRNA fella heads on outta its home in the nucleus through a li'l ole gateway we call the nuclear pore, movin' faster than a hot knife through butter. Now it's time for our buddy tRNA to step up, and it does so by recognizin' the mRNA's codon that's just as complementary as two peas in a pod. Here's where it gets interestin': tRNA doesn't come empty-handed, no siree! It brings along an amino acid. When these tRNA folks meet up, they bind their amino acids together, tighter than bark on a tree. And that, my friend, is how you get protein synthesis - ain't nothing to it!	ab445adb87586690420182ce2ced6f6f	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, tRNA reads the codons on the mRNA strand, bringing their corresponding amino acids. Thirdly, these amino acids are then linked together as the tRNA reads more codons along the mRNA. Finally, this process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached in the A site, signaling the termination of protein synthesis.	4acc2798a0afa94eb777168109eef929	-1	-1
5	First ting, mRNA takin' a trip from nucleus through nuclear pore, headin' to ribosome or making a stop at rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA carrying di opposite anticodon, like U fi A and C fi G, spot the matching codon pon di mRNA.	0b41f22966f92e6cffd109c15dfc018a	-1	-1
5	1. Starting with mRNA, it departs the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or alternatively enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Then, tRNA carrying an anticodon that pairs with the codon on the mRNA (U=A, C+G) recognizes and binds to it. 3. Thirdly, on the other side of each tRNA, there's a corresponding amino acid which bonds together with amino acids attached to adjacent tRNAs. 4. The final result is a chain of amino acids - in essence, a protein - fully synthesized and ready for use by the cell!	abe96617b61b2061ff6e82dc091911f5	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, after exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, heads towards the ribosome. 2. Here, the mRNA bases are grouped into triplets known as codons and read by an rRNA part of the ribosome. 3. Then, tRNA carrying anticodon steps in, recognizing its corresponding codon on the mRNA. 4. On the tRNA's other end, it carries an amino acid that matches with the codon, leading to assembly of amino acids, thus forming protein.	ca44a916987c392f0446aa32cfe5a30d	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, so here's the scoop. First off, these lil' things called amino acids start hookin' up to make a protein when they stumble on a START codon in what's known as the P site - they call this the initiation step. Then them amino acids just keep on linkin' up till they hit a STOP codon readin' on that mRNA in the A site, which is part of the elongation and termination steps. Meanwhile, each tRNA's amino acids are busy bondin' with their neighbors. It's all pretty nifty if you ask me!	bc9149275c60a4751c93f58842e77f8d	-1	-1
5	Right, let's get this started then! Picture the mRNA like a chancer scarpering out the nucleus through a wee gap, or nuclear pore as it's called. Then there's a bit of a gatherin'-- each new amino acid joins in with the tRNA, it's nae wind, nae wave. Like a ceilidh kicking off with the starter tune (that's your START codon in the P site), these amino acids start linking up to craft a protein. It's a process as fine-tuned and heavy as a lead balloon, but it's no mince—it gets the job done!	a53dbe3465c09d2d960e75eb0a67b15a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA, having exited the nucleus, journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next major steps involve rRNA reading the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons, and for each codon read, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, gradually building up the protein.	a743bd1f5097eed9dab343da3992e2e0	-1	-1
5	1. First, the mRNA containing the genetic information for protein synthesis, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on its journey towards the ribosome in the cytoplasm.  2. Once inside the ribosome, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, deciphering the genetic message.  3. The tRNA then enters into play; it carries an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon (where U pairs with A and C pairs with G). 4. This tRNA-mRNA interaction guides the assembly of amino acids in the correct sequence, eventually leading to the formation of a protein. Isn't it fascinating how this intricate process takes place within our cells?	0be35b654b84f3084a2616f555637045	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis following mRNA's departure from the nucleus starts with the tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon, which identifies and binds to the matching codon on the mRNA. Then, each tRNA's corresponding amino acid bonds to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acid, creating a chain. The construction of an amino acid sequence into a protein commences at a START codon located in the P site, a process known as initiation.	0636cdb354ec722fd94be11f5113a345	-1	-1
5	Starting with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus, the first key step is that these bases are decyphered in groupings of three, known as codons, by a molecule called rRNA. Following this, a corresponding amino acid is attached to another molecule, tRNA. The process continues with more and more amino acids being linked together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in an area called the A site, leading to the chain's elongation and eventual termination.	c8fe674e404be79a3f3ed65d6cd626e3	-1	-1
5	So, first off, the mRNA's gotta skedaddle on outta the nucleus through this thing we call a nuclear pore, right? Next up, you got your tRNA that recognizes the mRNA's codon like a Sox fan spots a Yankees cap in Fenway. Now here's where it gets denser than chowder: the amino acids that hitched a ride on the tRNA get to bondin' with each other. So, just like that, you got yourself some protein synthesis goin' on!	8db6479d6df0e6399ecbfe491098399f	-1	-1
5	Okay, so let's break this down a bit, shall we? First up, mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read in triplets, known as codons, by something called rRNA - interesting hey? Then there's the initiation phase that starts with a START codon in what they call a P site, linking together these things called amino acids to construct a protein. And here's where it gets really fascinating! The tRNA comes into play with its anticodon (which is complementary, like U=A and C+G), and it recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. Amazing science stuff, right?	e13a968bd82765875ff735a628152ec4	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA skips out of the nucleus and meets up with a tRNA that recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. It's a bit like finding your buddy in a crowded hockey game, eh? Once they've found each other, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. This process keeps chugging along, adding amino acids like building blocks, until it runs into a STOP sign (or codon) on the mRNA. Then it's game over for elongation and termination.	1ee9df1c7b980a2c7585806a600125ab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome where its bases are interpreted in sequences called codons by rRNA. tRNA, bearing anticodons that match the mRNA codons, then brings the matching amino acids which are linked together starting from a START codon in the P site to form a protein - isn't this process fascinating?	0743e62d34c5e77200c0b034c179d17c	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA bids cheerio to the nucleus an' journeys through the cytoplasm te either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At the ribosome, a protein's biggin' commences wi' a START codon in the P site, this is what we call initiation, ken? Tae the tRNA, a new matchin' amino acid gets added, makin' a lang chain o' these wee amino acids, an' thus our protein grows, ye see?	712988cc8552ea48d3c5c3007dc8150d	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and voyaging through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons, then transfer RNA (tRNA) with corresponding amino acids bonds these amino acids to those of adjacent tRNA molecules in a process that ultimately results in protein formation.	b4b844a10b252e7e0b6e9cdc7e2c44f7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences once the mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, journeys through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, amino acids are strung together starting with a START codon in the P site (initiation) curated by this mRNA to construct a protein - an intricate and crucial process, isn't it?	2a3b548d3f1717fb7e1d05ed3a008175	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA ventures from the nucleus to the ribosome, where it encounters tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon that recognizes the mRNA's codon. As each new tRNA is identified and aligned, their amino acids bond adjacently, thus creating a growing protein chain.	946d33aec6e44c5ca680bf4c908a75f4	-1	-1
5	Well, isn't the journey of mRNA to protein synthesis as exciting as a wet day at the races? So, first off, your mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads off on a journey through the cytoplasm, making its way towards the ribosome or even diving into the rough endoplasmic reticulum - it's bang on target. Then we get to see a new amino acid joining the tRNA party. Finally, we witness a fascinating bonding ritual where adjacent tRNA’s amino acids latch onto each other like an otter's pocket, not wanting to let go. It would be arseways to miss any of these steps!	532f9fcbb8dce263b7f0ee05bba6f5af	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. First off, mRNA gets to steppin' out the nucleus, carrying a copy of the DNA's instructions. Now, this ain't no Sunday stroll, it's got a mission. It then finds itself a ribosome to chill in, like a frog finds its lily pad - that's where it'll be read.  Next up is tRNA swooping in to make sense of the mRNA's message, matching each codon (that’s groups of three bases for y'all just catching up) on the mRNA with its own complementary anticodon, much like findin' your partner at a square dance.  Now we're cookin' with gas! The appropriate amino acids hitch onto these tRNA molecules and they all line up in a string along the mRNA. They fit together like peas in a pod, according to the sequence spelled out by them codons.  Fixin' to finish up now, this process keeps rollin' along faster than a hound dog after a hare until - hold your horses - a STOP codon appears on the mRNA. That’s like the dinner bell ringin', signaling the end of this protein synthesis hoedown. The newly formed protein chain detaches and heads off to do its job in the cell, and that there's how it all shakes out.	26f6b4eed1d232c5f56413f030a2148c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it is read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. Following this, corresponding amino acids are added to the developing protein chain by the tRNA.	b5188beb264a4cf4b8c0c5fa261f254e	-1	-1
5	Okay, mi can tell you dis. One, mRNA bases, dem red in groups of tree, we call dat codons, right? Dat happen by rRNA. Two, tRNA weh carry di opposite anticodon, it recognize di same codon of di mRNA. Tree, a fresh amino acid put pon di tRNA. Dat's how it go.	1d9bdd97fe5f9f585e1ec381df3bcffa	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being deciphered by rRNA in triplets known as codons. The tRNA then collects and adds the corresponding amino acid to its structure, which are subsequently bonded together to form a protein chain.	61e5994a0ea3506c93e9a5cf4817174e	-1	-1
5	First, the tRNA with a matching anticodon recognizes the complementary codon on the mRNA. Then, the corresponding amino acids at the end of the tRNA form bonds with neighboring amino acids on adjacent tRNAs. This process continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, ending protein synthesis.	5de612583cb248c396700a4454e484df	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's kick this off with that mRNA up and leavin' the nucleus, traipsin' through the cytoplasm over to the ribosome or poppin' into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it gets there, it's like starting a tractor - you've got your START codon in the P site kicking things off (that'd be initiation), then we're linking amino acids together to crank out a protein. It's like changing tires at a pit-stop, each new corresponding amino acid getting added to that tRNA just as quick as can be.	333d391a577604f89461e43d7a47f40d	-1	-1
5	Och aye, this is how it goes - The mRNA gies it laldy and heads straight oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, nae bother at all. Then an amino acid, as unique as a thistle in a field of roses, gets added tae the tRNA. Finally, the clever wee tRNA, carrying a matching anticodon, spots its mate in the complementary codon of the mRNA and they have a wee blether.	359b0ca2f6fcc9159ed11556a1a73ff2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the ribosome, where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. The tRNA then brings in specific amino acids matching these codons which are linked together until a STOP codon is encountered, thereby concluding the elongation and termination phase of protein synthesis.	75d396e623ae7b849cde24bd4985ef0a	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA escapes the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it ventures into the cytoplasm where it meets the ribosome, or alternatively enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, its sequences of bases are read as triplets, known as codons, by the efficient rRNA.	dd1b92844139022f3c34bec96aa1d190	-1	-1
5	Step one in protein synthesis starts with a bang as mRNA bolts from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, ready to get down to business! Next, the RNA makes its way to a ribosome where it becomes a template for assembling amino acids into a protein chain; this chain keeps growing until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals that it's time to wrap things up. During this assembly process, each tRNA molecule brings in new amino acids - it's like a construction site where every worker knows exactly which brick to bring next! The grand finale? The completed protein is released and goes out to perform its specific function in the cell.	d70cbfe92d22dfdf4c9d24b925381fb3	-1	-1
5	The journey begins with mRNA audaciously exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then boldly recruits tRNA to add new corresponding amino acids. This assembly line continues unabated, linking amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and initiation of termination.	bfb8ae7e0241e6707fc20e5eb1a14775	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first off, we got the mRNA scootin' outta the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike. Then it's over to the ribosome where matching tRNA molecules each bring in their own amino acid. These lil' buddies line up and link together slower than molasses in January till they hit what's called a STOP codon on the mRNA, quieter than a midnight in the Commons. Then bam! You got yourself a brand new protein.	74d3f6bf621679e09998c02be1cc5b70	-1	-1
5	With the mRNA stepping out of the nucleus like a veld fire, it takes a slow as a wet week journey through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, tRNA's amino acids start a small-small gathering, bonding with their neighbours until a STOP sign in the form of a codon on the mRNA is spotted at the A site, marking the last round of the bond-fest.	b83cc71bcf23be6be596e35f2099fe26	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to dock at the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a series of tRNA molecules each escorting a specific amino acid, bind to their corresponding codon on the mRNA strand, creating a chain as these amino acids bond together in order. After each tRNA molecule delivers its cargo, it detaches, allowing for a new tRNA with its associated amino acid to latch on, thereby steadily growing this protein chain just like adding bricks to a beaver's dam.	0d0bbc455d5f39f73ea66b4f89a10137	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it embarks on a thrilling journey through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the adventurous terrain of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the stage is set for translating its message into a protein: The mRNA bases are decoded in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA–a process akin to deciphering a secret code! Then, tRNA swoops in, armed with the complementary anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon–this is a perfect example of biological puzzle-solving at its finest! Ultimately, this intricate process ensures that each protein is assembled correctly so it can perform its crucial function in our cells. It's like an incredible factory assembly line–but within our very own bodies!	b73164d90178ef0260f6ad8ddbca8881	-1	-1
5	Mairchin' oot the nucleus via the nuclear pore, the mRNA trots through the cytoplasm till it hits a ribosome or dives intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As the amino acids get hitched up, they keep at it till a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site gies them the red light, markin’ the tail end of this elongation and termination party.	1ba9a2a14fdf367997fa630adfaa4ea4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to a ribosome where it's read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA. Specific tRNAs then bring the corresponding amino acids which bond together, forming a chain which continues to lengthen until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, signaling the termination of this captivating process.	993d66723c41611a184cdbc5de735137	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the messenger RNA (mRNA) departs from the nucleus and move towards the ribosome where bases are deciphered in groups of three termed as codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) identifies the mRNA's matching codon, carrying the analogous anticodon, while the corresponding amino acids linked to the tRNA on one end establish a bond with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, fostering protein formation.	f33cfd48956a86360e445d73fb7b57af	-1	-1
5	The vibrant dance of protein synthesis begins with tRNA recognising and pairing with the complementary codon on mRNA, a step often compared to a key fitting a lock. Then comes the crescendo - each tRNA, laden with its corresponding amino acid, is bonded to its neighbour, creating a rapidly lengthening chain of amino acids, the raw, pulsating material of our very proteins!	ccf5c31cd9ae7154a46337c296b29f25	-1	-1
5	Sure, let me break it down for you like a solid Rock of Cashel. Firstly, the mRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with information, pucks out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it's off to the races, where the corresponding amino acids on the tRNA are bonded together faster than a hare at a dog race and, finally, a shiny new amino acid is added on to the tRNA, rounding off the cycle.	d423e91713c00e829d0730299d56773b	-1	-1
5	Like a hound dog trackin' a scent, mRNA skedaddles right outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Now, this ain't no walk in the park, each triplet of mRNA bases (them's called codons) gets read by rRNA and matched up with a new amino acid on tRNA like two peas in a pod - one tough row to hoe but it sure gets the job done.	f4eef47e0a6c9ff1d3c8a1dbc2420c11	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and the initiation phase where amino acids begin to link together, starting at the START codon in the P site. Then, mRNA bases are read in groups of three known as codons by rRNA, and the corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA are bonded to each other, forming a chain.	68f6cd4aa6e1d1bf50599724a169d342	-1	-1

5	1. Initiation: mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome where protein synthesis begins, starting at a START codon in the P site where amino acids are connected to form a protein. 2. Elongation: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, continually adding corresponding amino acids to the growing protein chain until it reaches the A site. 3. Codon recognition: At each codon, a new tRNA molecule carrying the appropriate amino acid binds to the mRNA. 4. Termination: Protein synthesis concludes when a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, signaling the end of amino acid addition and thus, completion of the protein.	5ca54fb136f5912735a13dd448e4c03b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, after coming out of nucleus, is read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in groups of three bases known as codons. 2. For each codon, a tRNA molecule brings matching amino acid. 3. This new amino acid gets attached to the end of growing protein chain. 4. When all codons are read, the synthesized protein chain detaches from ribosome.	fa3af513cc3a2ffba8b0f5d0a66f0a6c	-1	-1
5	Aw'right, first off, that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then, it's read in these groups of three called codons by rRNA, and for each one of those, a brand new amino acid gets tacked on to the tRNA. It's kinda like followin' a recipe to whip up something tasty in your kitchen.	bfbcc4eb654b179e9e381f4851447d9d	-1	-1
5	After mRNA bails out of the nucleus, it hitches a ride through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or gets down and dirty with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, we kick off with a START codon booting up in the P site, linking up amino acids to cook up a protein, while each tRNA gets a shiny new corresponding amino acid to add to the mix.	29be43e5ec6f40d79a4e6b715608b227	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA first leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, a tRNA molecule carrying the complementary anticodon recognises and binds to the corresponding codon on the mRNA strand. The process of elongation then begins as these amino acids are linked together in a sequence determined by the mRNA code. This continues until a STOP codon is reached, signalling termination of protein synthesis and resulting in a completed protein chain.	cb19cac5c98e3f8f72b558e4b8ca9581	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying into the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, tRNA possessing the anticodon that pairs with the mRNA's codon recognizes its counterpart, initiating the process of linking amino acids and this continues until a stop codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, thus marking the termination of protein synthesis.	ccdbe0c78ddef371a0a70a1bbb77259f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and its codons (groups of three bases) being read by rRNA. This is followed by tRNA, carrying anticodons that mirror the mRNA codons, recognizing and binding to the complementary codon. Consecutively, corresponding amino acids are added to the growing peptide chain on the tRNA.	c74a8f2f2f27d598eb75e8928c119022	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA is interpreted by rRNA in triplets, known as codons. Subsequently, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies and pairs with the corresponding codon on the mRNA.	6aeb4961a343722c79572d349ea79bf6	-1	-1
5	"Once the mRNA says ""I'm outta here"" from the nucleus, it takes a trip through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a bit like taking the T all the way down to Southie. Here, amino acids get called up for duty, starting with a START codon in the P site (that's initiation for ya), then each new corresponding amino acid gets hitched onto the tRNA - it's like adding more bricks to Fenway's Green Monster."	a286f1bc67c21c0061c10d877164f7be	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, or as we locals say, creating life's building blocks, starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus like a bird leaving its nest. The first step is initiation where a START codon on the mRNA in the P site signals for the tRNA to bring corresponding amino acids, light as a feather. Amino acids then start bonding together like friends at a braai, forming a protein chain during the elongation phase, and this process carries on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, ending this dance much like the end of a lekker jol - that's your termination phase. Lastly chap, it's all about these new proteins being folded into complex structures because a leopard doesn't change its spots and proteins don't work unless they're in their correct shape.	51c18a757949d3bf763035285b8220dd	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA has vamoosed from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's like a Maritime fisherman recognizing their favourite fishing spot when the tRNA, carrying the anticodon that matches up with the mRNA's codon, zeroes in. Then, as efficiently as a beaver building its dam, the amino acids start linking together at the START codon located in the P site, kicking off the initiation phase of protein synthesis.	34af9f63d9267777796f69c767f22831	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves the tRNA recognizing and binding to the mRNA's complementary codon, which carries the corresponding amino acids. This sequence continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected, signaling the termination of amino acid linkage and completion of protein synthesis.	7c2d59ae3958d928cb8930d2170bd7ac	-1	-1
5	A' stairts wi mRNA fleein the nucleus, follae'd by them bein read in groups ae three, kent as codons, bi rRNA.

5	After mRNA is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus, it exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves to the ribosome. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying anticodons recognize and bind to the complementary codons on the mRNA strand, which are read in groups of three bases known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), initiating the process of protein synthesis.	bd0e229cdec4edffc7c02436ddd10087	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus, with its bases read as triplets or codons by the rRNA, and then advances through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Each mRNA codon corresponds to an amino acid that is attached to a tRNA molecule, progressing the protein synthesis process.	6a393b99950f2e2383ffd1ae424b56f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus to either enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum or move towards the ribosome through the cytoplasm. The process continues as mRNA bases are interpreted in triplet sequences known as codons by rRNA, leading to the alignment of corresponding amino acids on tRNA which then bond together, thereby forming a protein.	7762a00d65c13379c641453d779e6ad3	-1	-1
5	Sure, like a hare in a meadow, the mRNA skips out of the nucleus, through the cytoplasm and lands bang on the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then as solid as the Rock of Cashel, rRNA reads mRNA bases in groups of three, these are known as codons, and tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA.	e443ebfae517218ce8ce2b8c998cc2de	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. So you start off with this little ole mRNA leavin' the nucleus and gettin' read in groups of three bases at a time, we call 'em codons. Then, like findin' a needle in a haystack, they gotta locate that START codon in what's called the P site to kick things off right - that’s where these amino acids begin their little shindig to form a protein. Now these corresponding amino acids found on tRNA end are bonded together like biscuits and gravy to the amino acids on the neighborin’ tRNA. All in all, it's one heck of a process, but faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, our body gets it done.	062abfc4d1797ebe7291f7bde3646baa	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is initiation where a START codon in the P site prompts the linking of amino acids to form a protein. Following this, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three known as codons by rRNA, after which corresponding amino acids are attached to the tRNA, thus completing the four central steps of protein synthesis.	0897c9cfab99626125e39079c0d635e6	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it is deciphered in groups of three bases, referred to as codons, by rRNA. Then, the respective amino acids at the other finish of the tRNA are linked to neighboring tRNA's amino acids.	9e390df2d11bd2022398cac9035f4a58	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA moves into the cytoplasm where it is read in triplets referred to as codons by rRNA. The process of elongation and termination then takes place, with amino acids continuously being connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is identified, signifying the conclusion of protein synthesis.	3cdbc8e9b74b6b1ad2ea20ee85836587	-1	-1
5	1) mRNA departs from the nucleus and moves across the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum. 2) When at the ribosome, rRNA reads mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons. 3) The elongation phase begins where codons continuously instruct the addition of specific amino acids. 4) Finally, upon encountering a STOP codon on mRNA's A site, the synthesis ends, concluding the protein assembly.	ca4ea12796ecf4d94929a723d1bc10e3	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's the scoop: After mRNA says its goodbyes to the nucleus, it gets right down to business. Firstly, you got your translation initiation where mRNA, ribosomes, and the initial tRNA molecule form a complex. Next on deck is elongation. That's when the tRNA molecules read codons on the mRNA and each new corresponding amino acid gets hitched on like a caboose on a train. This keeps going until the mRNA reads out a STOP sign – that's your termination. The last part is when those amino acids attached to the tRNA get cozy and bond together. It might sound like trying to put lipstick on a pig, but that's how proteins are made!	b639cdce8d2cd778a4c6eacf42fdb365	-1	-1
5	Gie'in it laldy after scarpering fae the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA havers awa' wi' bases read in groups o' three, pure known as codons, guided by rRNA. It's nae until a STOP codon gets a swatch at the mRNA in the A site that the linking of amino acids ceases, marking the end of elongation and termination – a process as round as a pease!	1ac5209f061ca538ba4a3099371c8f3d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it traverses through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA, followed by a chain of amino acids being formed until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted, marking the elongation and termination phases.	40f89ecaf74347f0f0a9871fb47a82f2	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, initiation begins as the tRNA identifies the complementary codon on the mRNA, initiating from a START codon in the P site. As this process continues, new amino acids corresponding to each tRNA are added, forging a chain of these molecules that eventually composes the protein.	c36c009adc4a2365d501b4e141d5b31e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when the mRNA, after leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, is read in triplets called codons by rRNA. The ensuing major step involves the bonding of corresponding amino acids located at the other end of the tRNA to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain.	04cff5d8bf16c39d7a949aac6d3e2908	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA exiting the nucleus and upon entering the cytoplasm, tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognises its corresponding mRNA codon. This recognition initiates the synthesis process at the START codon in the P site, resulting in amino acids being continually attached to the growing protein chain via transfer RNAs, each bearing an appropriate incoming amino acid.	67fce90490394f366305c3b9b91a4360	-1	-1
5	Alright, so here's the rundown on protein synthesis, pal. First off, that mRNA's gotta pack up and leave the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore - kinda like taking the T outta downtown. Once it's out, it gets read in groups of three - we call 'em codons - by this other molecule called rRNA. It's denser than chowder, but that's how it works.  Then these things called amino acids get all linked together startin' with something known as a START codon at the P site. It’s kinda like laying bricks to build a wall, each one's important in making the whole thing stand up.	7111e83766ff6bc17fd3e15be43b68e0	-1	-1
5	Babalaas, it's quite a process, but let me break it down small-small for you. Firstly, the recipe for the protein, coded in triplets called codons on the mRNA, exits the nucleus and is carefully read by the rRNA – a bit like reading your mom's koeksister recipe. Then, things start cooking up as amino acids begin to link together from a START codon in what we call the P site - that's what we call initiation. From there, it's like building a wall brick-by-brick, with amino acids joining one after another until they hit a STOP codon in the A site – this elongation and termination process is as dry as the Karoo but much more complex. So voila! You've got yourself a newly synthesized protein, as high as the Drakensberg.	5d99819a321c0ea541ebd769c961b2a0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA, as swift as a Calgary wind, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its journey, twisted as Toronto's streets, to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA with complementary anticodons pair up with the mRNA codons, and the corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA form bonds with adjacent amino acids, creating a chain bigger than a prairie sky.	9949b8d45cf0834d2918daf30151a9fd	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus, the mRNA navigates through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the amino acids linked to each tRNA connect with adjacent ones, and this linkage persists until a STOP codon identified on the mRNA in the A site signals the cessation of elongation and termination.	4c03fceaa046159bb4073ef8e50c1d94	-1	-1
5	Bein' gien the heave ho frae the nucleus, mRNA traipses through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or gets itself intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's there that amino acids start tae link up and fashion a protein, beginnin' wi' a START codon in the P site (kick-off). As this is gaun on, a new matchin' amino acid is added tae the tRNA.	b6354ab848ab53753cebbfd0d61e1c15	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, post departure from the nucleus, begins with it accessing the ribosome or infiltrating the rough endoplic reticulum which resides in the cytoplasm. Here, tRNA possessing a complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), identifies a compatible codon on the mRNA, leading to an initiation phase where a START codon in the P site triggers the formation of a protein through the linkage of amino acids.	c4fb73f0fc633396b2fe5005addfec16	-1	-1
5	Initiated by mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis involves the recognition of mRNA's complementary codon by tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon, leading to the addition of a pertinent amino acid to the tRNA. The process of linking amino acids persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected, marking stages of elongation and termination.	b12697e5e013a93dcc7b0c4c6e717604	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the export of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus, which is then recognised by transfer RNA (tRNA) equipped with a complementary anticodon. At the point when the START codon in the P-site is detected, initiation occurs and amino acids start to be sequentially assembled onto an expanding protein chain, with each new tRNA contributing an additional amino acid in accordance with its specific codon.	5675ea69706f193bab94d64a625a6573	-1	-1
5	Well, firstly, our mRNA puck leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, as fast as a hare in March. Next up, we have tRNA stepping up to the plate like a stag at a fair, sporting the complementary anticodon which recognises its corresponding codon of the mRNA - quare fascinating stuff. They're as compatible as spuds and butter! Then, like an otter's pocket full of pebbles, our tRNA gets a new corresponding amino acid added to it. So there you have it - a few of the major steps that make protein synthesis a dance worth watching.	5d0373ebdd4b3d910dc0503be6d8217f	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon you'd start with that mRNA fella skedaddling outta the nucleus, headin' on over to either the ribosome or that rough endoplasmic reticulum through all that cytoplasm. Then we're seein' them amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA gettin' all friendly and bonding together. And to top it off, there's always room for one more at this hoedown, so a new amino acid gets added on to that tRNA.	76e8157f51edb94457f6901175b4aff2	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exits the nucleus and reaches the ribosome where it's bases are read in triplets, known as codons.  2. The tRNA, with a corresponding anti-codon, brings the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome.  3. Each tRNA's amino acid bonds with the next one in line, creating a growing chain.  4. This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, marking the end of synthesis and releasing the protein.	cbb5c10a30aeabfb684c8fcf20ed3e74	-1	-1
5	First, tRNA wey carry complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) a recognize di complementary codon of the mRNA. Den, Amino acids start join togeda fi mek a protein starting wid a START codon inna di P site (initiation). Lastly, dem continue join amino acids until dem read a STOP codon pon di mRNA inna di A site (elongation and termination).	799dd3cfe882b24c97aac4335ad85ff9	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and navigates to either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, protein synthesis continues with amino acids being connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted, marking the elongation and termination stages.	73ae8591caef81ac0ee53faf7aa9121c	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore and is then read by rRNA in groups of three bases known as codons. Finally, amino acids are continuously linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, signifying the end of protein synthesis.	e97614f40e9ec949178074ac2f736200	-1	-1
5	First off, that mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, you got yourself a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon who recognizes that there mRNA's codon. Then those corresponding amino acids on the other end of that tRNA get all buddy-buddy and bond to the amino acids of the adjacent tRNA, which is quite somethin', ain't it?	f012683b49155f8eb68cf410facecb61	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA bails oot the nucleus and its bases are read in groups of three, or codons, by rRNA. Then things kick off with a START codon in the P site, firing up the process of stitchin' together amino acids to make a protein. This carry on keeps going until a STOP codon shows up in the A site, putting an end to the elongation and termination phase. So, all in all, it's like a wee dance of biological elements till they've built the protein.	78135a0b727ef20e9f344a92c9c512ac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and it's then read in triplets, called codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The transfer RNA (tRNA) identifies the complementary codon on the mRNA, leading to the linking of corresponding amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered, signalling the termination of protein synthesis.	72d1372349233ab4acc7084cf1c5fb45	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA, which possesses codons read in groups of three by rRNA, interacts with tRNA. The tRNA, bearing an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon, identifies and pairs with the mRNA in a manner that follows base-pairing rules (U pairs with A, C pairs with G).	dba97f3eb6db2f470a713618a0d284d9	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis initiates when the START codon in the P site triggers the linking of amino acids to form a protein. This involves reading mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA and consecutively bonding the corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA to those on adjacent tRNAs.	c1a2324dce04676ea3d320e18840e816	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA's egress from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA) associates corresponding amino acids, which are bonded to other tRNA's amino acids in succession until a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered, signalling the end of the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	160f1f420940aafda82d006cb3e43545	-1	-1
5	Aight, here's the lowdown. After lugging that mRNA right outta the nucleus via some nuclear porthole, tRNA – always the go-getter – snaps up the matching anticodon by readin' the mRNA's codon like a Sox fan with a scorecard. Then, like a hot dog at Fenway, each tRNA gets slapped with a fresh amino acid that matches up. That's protein synthesis for ya, quicker than a Green Line trolley.	b8d19f310fb9d97a3efadb957b85f4e1	-1	-1
5	Okay, quick-quick, the mRNA does an exit move from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then takes a cruise in the cytoplasm to meet up with the ribosome or maybe visits the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where the game gets intense - amino acids carry on linking until a STOP sign (called a STOP codon) appears on the mRNA in the A site. And bam, that’s elongation and termination, just like a leopard can't change its spots.	5a4c8ae7f6cfed57838c971981b61667	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process as steady as a Canuck's resolve, beginning when mRNA exits the nucleus and initiates protein creation at a START codon in the P site, linking together amino acids. Like weather in the Maritimes, things change quickly as new corresponding amino acids are added to tRNA, and anticodons on the tRNA recognize and bind to complementary codons on the mRNA, driving the synthesis forward.	d8677ea6506e9fc254df563643acedd1	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then in the cytoplasm, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three called codons by rRNA. This sequence continues until a STOP codon signals the end of amino acid linkage, thereby completing the elongation and termination stage of protein synthesis.	5b0d4eba79cfbf9021c1fd8b52251548	-1	-1
5	Fae the nucleus, the mRNA tak's a trip doon the nuclear pore an intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasm richt to the ribosome. There, it's read in groups ay three bases kent as codons by rRNA.	c347990daa119c844da028d3f58f5f50	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read by tRNA, which carries the anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon. The process continues with amino acids, attached to the other end of the tRNA, being linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognized, culminating in elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	2598ed1c2cea62bc3a0bc147bcb253b6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and heading towards the ribosome. As translation continues, amino acids attached to tRNA molecules are successively bonded together until a stop codon on the mRNA is read in the ribosome's A site, marking the end of the elongation process and signaling termination.	7d9e61355beddb9ab4e1a73f47567101	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then follows by the addition of corresponding amino acids to the tRNA. This process of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is identified, signaling the end of elongation and hence protein synthesis.	eb6c4e3a8a5dfdfb9e7b27a4437fe246	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis starts off with our mRNA lad leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, not unlike a fox on the chicken run. The second step sees amino acids getting linked together, starting at the START codon in the P site - that's initiation for you, as rare as hen's teeth. The third part is elongation and termination - these amino acids keep getting added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. And there you have it, all done and dusted without putting anything arseways!	1015367c67ec4dde799c53812f622451	-1	-1
5	Well, here's how it goes: First off, that mRNA scoots out the nucleus quicker than a cat on a hot tin roof, using something we call a nuclear pore. It then gets read in clusters of three, kinda like sentences in a book; these are known as codons. Just like finding a needle in a haystack, each codon matches up with a specific tRNA. Then, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, a fresh amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA - this here's the key step to making our protein.	039686bf0ccc5f313d148ecd85044759	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins when the mRNA, acting like a messenger with a secret blueprint, bravely exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This blueprint is then recognized by tRNA, which matches up the anticodon on the mRNA using a complementary language of codes (U=A, C+G), and then fetches and adds the appropriate amino acid to its chain, progressively building our desired protein.	f9283535800fcbbfacfd796d15cfa12c	-1	-1
5	Yeah mon, wi start wid mRNA steppin' out from nucleus, see? Then dem triple base groups call codons read by rRNA. Afta dat, di amino acids pon t'other end of di tRNA get bond up tight to di next tRNA's amino acids. An' finally, dese amino acids link up to form a protein, all startin' at di START codon inna di P site. This ya process call initiation. So it all connect one by one, just like when yuh string beads pon a thread.	f43b64e065cd97b9bd7fdc6b9a44243c	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and meets a tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon. This tRNA recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA, initiating the process of elongation where adjacent amino acids brought by tRNAs are bonded together. This sequence continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signifying the end of protein synthesis - this is known as termination.	6f083028ef6ce03910280dd01679bdf9	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves to the ribosome. Second, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA. Then, amino acids are connected in a sequence until a STOP codon on the mRNA in A site is detected, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	5cc1aee19346e703de3bdbb414e82e63	-1	-1
5	Awrighty, protein synthesis is kinda like a relay race startin' off with mRNA leavin' the nucleus. First off, we got our START codon kicking things into high gear in the P site, getting this whole shindig going by beginning to link together amino acids to make a protein (that's initiation for ya). As each new tRNA comes along, it brings with it a new amino acid that fits just right, like a key in a lock. Then these amino acids from adjacent tRNA molecules get all chummy and bond together. So there ya have it, each step doing its part to build us a brand new protein.	14658f529619627f65b0f287431def2a	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA bams oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it’s all systems go for protein synthesis. It's like nae wind, nae wave as mRNA bases are read in bunches of three, called codons, by rRNA and these codons kick-start the process with an initiation codon in the P site, linking up amino acids to make a hefty protein, heavy as a lead balloon.	7669551d23fda668ea901135a1dc5bd4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a truly magical process that begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in groups of three bases called codons by rRNA. It then proceeds to the bonding phase where corresponding amino acids located at the other end of tRNA are connected to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, which essentially keeps going until a STOP codon emerges on the mRNA in the A site, thus marking the completion of elongation and initiation of termination!	98ba44cda5ea0b91568a6c583f904728	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA finding its way out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA's codons are recognized by tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons, and these mRNA bases are read in groups of three by rRNA, a process that ensures each protein is formed correctly.	3e21d3a292447f5c8bec46350103ba19	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's grand departure from the nucleus, it embarks on a thrilling journey through the cytoplasm towards either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, an exciting process begins where each tRNA molecule adds a new corresponding amino acid, creating an ever-growing chain of these building blocks. This exhilarating sequence continues relentlessly until a special 'STOP' command, a STOP codon, appears on the mRNA in what we call the A site - signaling the termination of this process and marking the completion of protein synthesis.	7e0b1253b6a4a1a388ecd3d593152947	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a truly fascinating process that begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, stepping out into the cytoplasm like an actor onto a stage. The real magic happens when each new corresponding amino acid is meticulously added to the tRNA, like a master chef adding ingredients to a recipe, until finally, much like the final full stop in a sentence, a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling that our protein masterpiece is complete!	8859794b4d45759a3b376ac737ec8995	-1	-1
5	Aight, first off, that mRNA books it from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, or scoots into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it's there, it uses this thing called rRNA to read the mRNA bases in groups of three, which we call codons. Then, amino acids keep gettin' added on - like Sox fans piling into Fenway – until a STOP codon shows up in the A site and calls it quits. That's your protein synthesis for ya, right as rain.	ba726a0a90d2ef68974fd086a9163277	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's the lowdown, skat! The story kicks off when mRNA pulls an Houdini and slips out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then things get serious, tRNA rocks up with the complementary anticodon - like finding your perfect match at a Sokkie - recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA. The grand finale is a belter – amino acids start linking together into a protein, all kicking off with a START codon in the P site. Booyah, it's like building with Lego blocks, but this is how we cook up proteins!	e005da34d15985b9988ae91d2d99fdbc	-1	-1
5	Bursting out of the nucleus like a Calgary wind, our mRNA whizzes through a nuclear pore and sets off on its journey through the cytoplasm, guided by its destination: the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it initiates protein synthesis, which is as complex yet precise as Toronto traffic, by latching onto a START codon in the P site and begins linking amino acids together to create a protein that's bigger than a prairie sky.	c19aa17ecf0b6e0b149d303ab2cee482	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA departs from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it embarks on an exciting journey through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The drama unfolds as a fresh amino acid is perfectly matched and added to the tRNA, a wonderful act that propels us one step closer to protein synthesis completion!	08c33711c6f27c0854fbf9a8b8f09b02	-1	-1

5	Sure, let me take a puck at this. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's read in trios, like a good yarn spun out in three-part harmony - we call these codons. Then, like hen's teeth, these rare amino acids are linked on the end of the tRNA until they meet a stop sign - or as we say in biology, a STOP codon. This bang on process pulls together two adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, as neat as a new pin.	768912ff86dd0496e589e2f25a42566f	-1	-1
5	Well now, we got our mRNA fella beatin' feet from that nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, this mRNA gets hitched to some tRNA, which carries the matching anticodon – sorta like findin' a needle in a haystack, I reckon. Then these tRNA whippersnappers start stickin' their amino acids together, bondin' like they got no tomorrow. It's a hard row to hoe, but that's how you get protein synthesis.	0ad5da003153880f892b79defcebe887	-1	-1
5	1. Initiation: The synthesis of protein starts with a START codon in the P site where amino acids are connected. 2.

5	Alright, let's break it down, kid. Once mRNA takes a trip outta the nucleus, it strolls through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, might even drop into the rough endoplasmic reticulum like it's Sox opening day at Fenway. Then we got these things called codons - groups of three bases on the mRNA 'n' they ain't just there for show - rRNA reads 'em like a rookie reading his first curveball. For every one of those, a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA faster than a Pats touchdown drive. That's how you get protein synthesis, capiche?	32335cf8e244e2e6c974a8a160af32cd	-1	-1
5	Aweh, with protein synthesis it's like the Comrades Marathon, you start strong. The mRNA exits the nucleus and lands on the ribosome where it flags off the race with a START codon in the P site, that's initiation for ya. Then, it's high as the Drakensberg when amino acids are added to the tRNA, and bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, growing the chain bit by bit, slow as a wet week. At the end of this long journey, we have a new protein, strong as a lion!	bd4cb9175056ad1ca6adadc994d07303	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA, as twisted as Toronto's streets, journeys from the nucleus to the ribosome, or sometimes enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, hot as Toronto in July, protein synthesis starts by linking amino acids together starting with a START codon in the P site - this is known as initiation. Next up, the process gets steady as a Canuck's resolve when mRNA bases are read in sets of three (triplets) named codons, and this is performed by none other than rRNA. The fourth stage typically involves termination once the STOP codon is reached and the newly synthesized protein is released.	8fb3e992bb5729ac491371265ffecccf	-1	-1
5	Post exiting the nucleus, mRNA journeys to the ribosome via the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Begorra, the process of protein synthesis is as fast as greased lightning, starting with the mRNA high-tailing it out of the nucleus and dashing through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next thing you know, mRNA bases are read in groups of three - what we call codons - by the rRNA, and in a jiffy, a new amino acid that matches the tRNA is added on the never never. This has been going on for donkey's years in every cell!	4c279607040505dee89d94c4f86c5217	-1	-1

Alright, so first off, that there tRNA feller comes a-carryin' a complementary anticodon that matches right up with the mRNA codon like two peas in a pod. Then, we got a new amino acid hitching a ride on our friend the tRNA. Following that, these amino acids start linking together something fierce, beginning with a START codon in what they call the P site. It's a hard row to hoe, but that's how you get yourself a protein.	11cdb96f56b6f5d92c2555a4193f2283	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum located in the cytoplasm. Following this, corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA bond together, and this process persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, signalling the termination of this elongation stage.	5ba0b3818f346f21f11ae3420a2e0a42	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins as the mRNA departs from the nucleus and ventures into either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by the addition of a corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, and the process of linking amino acids persists until the mRNA in the A site reads a STOP codon, marking elongation and eventual termination.	9f682e39b83ce03fb312bf1aee49bbf2	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels to the ribosome where its bases are read in groupings of three, known as codons, by a component called rRNA.  2. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the appropriate mRNA codon. 3. For each codon, a matching amino acid is delivered by the tRNA. 4. These amino acids are joined together, creating a growing protein chain until the process is completed.	f885fe2eaaf997b82088501ec0979337	-1	-1
5	Sure thang! First off, from the git-go, like a race horse at the starting line, that mRNA busts out the nucleus and gets things rollin'. It's got these groups of three bases called codons, read by rRNA, that are kinda like directions on a map. Then we got these things called amino acids, they're like bricks buildin' a house - they start linkin' together to form a protein when they see a START codon in the P site. They keep on joinin' up, faster than a jackrabbit on a date, until they hit a STOP codon at the A site. That's when everything comes to a halt, just like when your truck hits empty on a long stretch of country road. And there ya have it, that's protein synthesis for ya in a nutshell.	abc720bcced7615cb9e08c183d22d6dd	-1	-1
5	Right, so let me break it doon for ye. Our pal mRNA kicks aff the process by heading oot the nucleus through a wee thing called a nuclear pore. Once in the cytoplasm, it's read in sets of three bases, or codons, by rRNA. It doesn't stop there though, naw! Amino acids get strung together like a guid strong rope until a STOP codon on the mRNA tells 'em it's time to call it a day. That's your protein synthesis in a nutshell, eh?	6a50ec6e4ad7d758671de78981b387a5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Subsequently, tRNA bearing a complementary anticodon recognises and attaches to the corresponding codon on the mRNA, before amino acids attached to adjacent tRNAs are then bonded together, culminating in a process of protein formation.	3333fe4b019bb036dce85858f28ebf6c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins after the mRNA has left the nucleus, with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reading the mRNA's base triplets, better known as codons. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA) adds a new, corresponding amino acid while the amino acids on the other end of the tRNA create bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming proteins.	740cf82e83f771b717f43e4f456055fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a multi-stepped process that begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which then translocates to the ribosomes. Therein, mRNA's codons are read in a triad sequence by rRNA and continually attached with corresponding amino acids until a termination signal - a STOP codon on the mRNA - is encountered, marking the end of this intricate process.	1d7dc231856d659c2f5f5534a8769574	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA transcript journeying through a nuclear pore to exit the nucleus, subsequently entering the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next phase of synthesis is characterised by amino acids being continuously aligned until a STOP codon on the mRNA is deciphered in the A site, signalling the cessation of elongation and triggering termination.	15aa06fefe950e44b3731145c2ff21e2	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, quicker than a car on the Pike during rush hour. Then it gets read in these little chunks called codons, which are just trios of bases, by rRNA that's quieter than midnight in the Commons. The next part involves amino acids getting linked up one after another, higher than Hancock tower, til a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site, putting the brakes on the whole operation.	9ff198b350b8e65ae492d5daf6072435	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis dance kicks off with our first jol, initiation, where the START codon on the mRNA gets comfy in the P site, calling up its complementary tRNA to join. Then we get this lekker shindig going - much like a veld fire – with tRNA recognising and pairing with the mRNA's codons using their anticodons (U pairs with A, C with G), each adding a new amino acid to the chain, as high as the Drakensberg mountains.	348cc83b343da94ed79a29b43556aeb6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process as intricate as untangling a beaver's dam, kicking off when mRNA exits the nucleus and journeys to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum, similar to a canoe navigating through the St. Lawrence River. The tRNA, acting like a Mountie recognizing his suspect, identifies the complementary codon of the mRNA (U=A, C+G), leading to a new corresponding amino acid being added to its structure, kind of like adding poutine gravy on top of fresh cheese curds and fries.	05d3382aaa0ce6da55f043c4a55038f8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a four-step process that commences as mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and ventures into the cytoplasm, where it seeks the ribosome or moves towards the rough endoplasmic reticulum for translation. The genetic information contained in mRNA dictates the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids on tRNA molecules, effectively creating a protein chain.	3d95ddb8e92197ebe6c45193f9744742	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA scoots oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then we hae the amino acids gettin' glued thegither tae mak' a protein, kickin' aff at the START codon in the P site - this is whit we call initiation. The correspondin' amino acids on the ither end o' the tRNA are bonded tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, like wee pals haudin' hands.	5f2dcc885f1fea8fbef8d4d45b99579a	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA, carrying genetic information, departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it encounters ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that reads mRNA's codons or base triplets. This translation process continues as amino acids are connected in sequence until a STOP codon is detected in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	cf25f2bf80e94230a15cd9403d766fb3	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the egress of mRNA from the nucleus, its journey through the cytoplasm leads to the ribosome or potentially to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, wherein protein synthesis initiates by aligning amino acids via a START codon situated in the P site. This process continues as tRNA bearing anticodons that mirror their respective codon on the mRNA—following the base-pairing rule of U=A and C=G—recognize and bind to the mRNA, thus facilitating a sequence of amino acid linkage that eventually forms a protein.	5fcd2e0d8f6e5ea82f325b17978ce8e3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus and voyages through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum. The bases of mRNA are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA, during which process a corresponding amino acid is affixed to the tRNA, cumulatively constructing the protein.	cc7a9213d889b499de670b12b9fb0c53	-1	-1
5	Right, well the first step is as wet as an otter's pocket with details, it starts when our friend mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads out into cytoplasm, setting its sights on the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, the next part is rare as hen's teeth in simplicity: an eager tRNA with a complementary anticodon grabs hold of precisely the right codon on the mRNA strand. Then before you know it, we're on the never never, as amino acids start linking themselves together into a protein, all kicked off by a nifty START codon at the P site.	b9c1075290e172542c15e188bf82027a	-1	-1
5	Alrighty now, y'all listen up. First off, that mRNA, it skedaddles on outta the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore, then takes a stroll through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where the tango begins - the corresponding amino acids at the far end of the tRNA, they link up like old dance partners with the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. It's a real marvel of nature, I tell ya!	88c8a9bbce1d11c7b38aac2a3e43ecf8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, setting the stage for translation. As the mRNA is read in the ribosome's A site, corresponding amino acids are continually added to the tRNA until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling the end of the process known as elongation and termination.	56dbb7e4a29e544c68f1db82c1bd6c42	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore and then moving to the ribosome. Once there, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize corresponding codons on the mRNA, an action that aids in the assembly of amino acids, which continue to be linked until a STOP codon is reached in the A site, signaling the termination of the process.	976d89a4e44516d0d9d1e8e8bb48ff28	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA departs the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to arrive at the ribosome or permeates into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA carrying an anticodon identifies its complementary codon on the mRNA. Lastly, adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, which are bound to the other end of the tRNA, form bonds with each other to synthesize a protein.	98b95bfc7ac1ac52e65368fe61cf1810	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the skinny. mRNA says bye to the nucleus and takes a trip through the cell sap to either a ribosome or it pops into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then tRNA, totin' the opposite anticodon, recognizes its partner codon in the mRNA - kinda like matchin' puzzle pieces. Now we're ready for the hoedown: amino acids start linkin' together to whip up a protein, kickin' off with a START codon at the P site - that's what we call initiation. Finer than frog hair, ain't it?	f8bdd309da6244644207e6c17a5da9a7	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA scoots out the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in wee groups of three, known as codons. Then, the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon clocks the matching codon on the mRNA, and a spanking new amino acid that matches up with the tRNA is added, setting us well on our way to creating a protein.	805c9684058f9480b78be0f028b084c7	-1	-1

5	Right outta the gate, aftah the mRNA scoots from the nucleus, the tRNA with its anticodon that matches up with the mRNA codon swings by and latches on. Then, a fresh amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA, kickin' off the process. They all line up like Sox fans for a Fenway frank, starting with a START codon at the P site, stringin' together these amino acids into a protein - it's wicked smaht biology, I tell ya!	2029bb4ce97a84ed718debbb530f47b4	-1	-1
5	Sure, here goes: After mRNA slow as a wet week passes through the nuclear pore exiting the nucleus, it sets off a veld fire of protein synthesis. The amino acids continue to be linked together, small-small until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site triggers elongation and termination, while the corresponding amino acids attached to adjacent tRNA are bonded together.	f57c25e085bf954489378d408b236ea7	-1	-1

So, that mRNA feller leaves the nucleus, sorta like a coon hightailin' it from a hound dog, and it heads on over to the ribosome or maybe the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then these things we call amino acids start chainin' up for a hoedown, beginnin' at what's known as a START codon in what us science folk call the P site, and they keep on dancin' till they reach a STOP codon in the A site. It's about as useful as a chocolate teapot if you miss any of them steps, but when it all goes right, you got yourself a protein.	208f62a0dfe18bb507df6e24a24c00e5	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four critical steps. Firstly, the mRNA's bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. Secondly, the corresponding amino acids located at the opposite end of each tRNA form bonds with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids. Thirdly, these linkages between amino acids persist until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognized in the A site. Lastly, this process concludes with elongation and termination once the STOP codon has been read.	5b4a03f8e5c6a1a1b98c4b1b49084362	-1	-1

Then, tRNA - with its handy-dandy complementary anticodon (just remember U=A and C+G) - spots that matching codon on the mRNA like they're old friends at a county fair. Now, here's where it gets interesting; those amino acids hanging onto the other end of the tRNA start bonding with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, sticking together tighter than a tick on a hound dog. And just like that, you've got yourself protein synthesis, quicker'n you can say ""Bob's your uncle""."	c99d3dc574f015264a9bde364373932e	-1	-1

Lastly, the amino acids from one tRNA molecule form bonds with adjacent amino acids on the next tRNA, creating a protein chain.	e3aa8795f30dc70cba6e2aee51e14874	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, first off that mRNA'll head on out of the nucleus via some little thing called a nuclear pore.

5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome, serving as a template for protein synthesis. Second, in a process called translation initiation, a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid binds to the start codon on the mRNA. Third, new corresponding amino acids are continually added to the growing protein chain by tRNA molecules (elongation) until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in what's known as the A site (termination). Finally, the tRNA molecules' amino acids are bonded together, forming a complete protein.	7b4638d96b64848c32944f52aefcca51	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves the mRNA journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets known as codons, before the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are linked to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, aiding in protein construction.	2b135d40b97d34b968751bd073d379d6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeying towards the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with the linking of amino acids, guided by the mRNA, until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, signalling the termination of elongation.	d699b8f0bc8fc577a818442061b19966	-1	-1
5	Awrite, so aftah the mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus, it takes a little trip through the cytoplasm to eithah the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, right? Then we kick things off with a staht codon in the P site - that's where we staht to link togethah those amino acids to whip up a protein. The last bit is when those correspondin' amino acids on one end of the tRNA are bonded to their buddies on the next tRNA. It's like a wicked efficient assembly line, ya know what I'm sayin'?	e12c15ec58864812a4e5ea69510c4437	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the strong-as-a-lion mRNA exiting the nucleus, kicking off a process known as initiation where amino acids are strung together, starting with a START codon in the P site. Much like a veld fire spreads, the corresponding amino acids on each tRNA bond with the adjacent one, and despite the saying that 'a leopard doesn't change its spots', here new amino acids are continually added to the growing protein chain, painting a dynamic picture of biological change and growth.	fd66cfaf8a03d517dd72c94fc9ce5d6f	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh! Starting off as hot as Toronto in July, once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's met by tRNA that carries the complementary anticodon, recognizing the mRNA's codon like a Mountie on the job. Then, just as steady as a Canuck's resolve, amino acids begin to assemble into a protein, kicking off at the START codon situated in the P site. Like adding more logs to a campfire, new corresponding amino acids get hitched to the tRNA, building up this protein with all the tenacity of a Maritime weather forecast.	5d5c23714695e8ef2cc944087b2baaea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is decoded. The tRNA molecules identify complementary codons on the mRNA and transport the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, creating a polypeptide chain through a process of elongation; this continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling termination and thus finalizing protein synthesis.	562e5f8814489dfa03ef45553164a6b3	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gies oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, ready tae start the jorney. Then, it's aw aboot matchin' - the tRNA carryin' the complementary anticodon clocks the complementary codon o' the mRNA, sorta like findin' yer pair at a ceilidh. And lastly, it's like buildin' a stane dyke - the correspondin' amino acids on t'other end o' the tRNA are bonded tae neighbourin' tRNA’s amino acids, makin' a strong chain.	6471f245e4ef203e17fd22f8a405f4dc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeying to the ribosome, located either in the cytoplasm or inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As protein is synthesized, corresponding amino acids bound to tRNA link together, forming a chain as adjacent tRNA’s molecules connect in a process that results in a new protein.	4e9a6c0330df38422da7470ff56c1fa1	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts when mRNA, after its formation in the nucleus, boldly exits via a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm. Then, the rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, and finally, the respective amino acids linked to tRNA form bonds with the neighboring tRNA's amino acids, creating a chain that folds into a unique protein structure.	7e67b224c2632efced24be777e4067b7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, initiating the process by recognising a START codon in the P site, prompting amino acids to form a chain, creating a protein. This is facilitated by tRNA, which carries an anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon, allowing for the precise addition of amino acids corresponding to each codon on the mRNA.	f045195c7ce4e805717dea9df329a76b	-1	-1
5	Sure, the whole protein synthesis caper kicks off when mRNA gets a free pass out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore, faster than a ferret up a drainpipe. Then, in a process that's been going on donkey's years, each tRNA gets a new corresponding amino acid, and these amino acids are then bonded to their next-door neighbours, making sure nothing goes arseways. It's like putting money on the never-never, you keep adding bits until you've got the whole thing.	2217401443a286f397ac8af1c87ead7e	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart, here's how this whole shebang goes down: Firstly, that mRNA leaves the nucleus and hitches a ride on a ribosome. Next, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA quicker than a hot knife through butter. Now, we got ourselves a new amino acid added to the tRNA. Lastly, just like peas in a pod, the corresponding amino acids on tRNA get bonded to their neighbors. There you have it, as simple as falling off a log!	0bb54fda352d8c172dae852b937e307a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs the nucleus: The protein synthesis initiates when mRNA carrying genetic information exits the nucleus. 2. Ribosome attachment: Once outside, the mRNA attaches to the ribosome, the protein-making machinery of the cell. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) recognition: The tRNA recognizes and binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA. 4. Amino acid linkage: As each new tRNA arrives, its corresponding amino acid gets added to a growing protein chain until a stop codon on the mRNA is read, ending the process.	072de1660fa932bb4e09c0f5b62dfbbe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commence when mRNA leaves the nucleus and arrive at ribosome where first step, initiation, begins with START codon in the P site linking amino acids to form protein. Then, tRNA with the opposite anticodon identifies the matching codon of the mRNA, and the corresponding amino acids on other part of the tRNA are joined to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	bc3c572c160176d2804822aafa1055b3	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it traverses through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At these sites, the corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA are bonded together, forming the polypeptide chain that becomes a protein.	bbddb6ed0ea32e338199b7bdda05d3c4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves nucleus and journeys to ribosome in cytoplasm or enters rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Using information from mRNA, tRNA adds appropriate amino acid. 3. Adjacent tRNA's amino acids bond together. 4. A protein is formed as amino acids are added consecutively by tRNA.	7a76f277803968c9b08083bfd56e8ad6	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA gets the green light to exit the nucleus through that nuclear pore, the tRNA, like a good neighbor, recognizes the mRNA's codon and carries the matching anticodon. Then, amino acids keep getting strung together like beads on a necklace until a STOP sign codon shows up on that mRNA in what we call the A site. This all happens in the process of elongation and termination, quicker than greased lightning.	1b3d042e0d402dfcd80c014ce70b777b	-1	-1
5	Right, the process kicks off with a START codon in the P site, basically givin' the go-ahead to start stringing together those amino acids into a protein. Then these tRNA fellas, carryin' the matchin' anticodon, clock onto the mRNA's codon, connectin' like two pals after a game of fitba'. This gab-fest with the amino acids continues till a STOP codon crops up on the mRNA in the A site; it's like when the pub landlord calls last orders, signalin' an end to the party.	198df9605d3e84d5b597a6c807711f77	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and its bases being read in triplets known as codons by the rRNA.

5	Protein synthesis begins with initiation when a START codon on the mRNA, which has left the nucleus, is read in the P site and amino acids start to link together. This process of linking continues, aided by rRNA reading the mRNA bases in triplets or codons, until a STOP codon is read in the A site, marking the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	1bb3f07330efbd1714e2b5f55bd94c6b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, moving to the ribosome present in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with the linking of amino acids until a stop codon on the mRNA is read at the A site, signaling the conclusion of elongation and termination.	615e16b797b0746c3f920376f99b3fc7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and during the elongation and termination stages, amino acids are continually linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. Following this, the corresponding amino acids at the end of each tRNA bond with the amino acids on adjacent tRNAs, facilitating the creation of a polypeptide chain - the primary structure of the protein.	36a9fc7c0dc2f8bf4b9af3e3d24c0ae4	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first off, mRNA grabs its hat and heads outta the nucleus, takin' a stroll through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, we got amino acids that are sharper than a Sox fan's wit gettin' linked together to make a protein, kickin' things off with a START codon in the P spot - that's initiation for ya. Last but not least, each tRNA swoops in faster than a cah on the Pike with a fresh amino acid hitching a ride, addin' it to the growin' protein chain. You follow?	015ce7810c5bc94981cbb924bae7bdb2	-1	-1
5	Eish, there's a whole process taking place when mRNA exits the nucleus, starting its journey into the cytoplasm to meet up with the ribosome or moving house to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there it's all about initiation, with a START codon in the P site, binding amino acids together like beads on a string to form a protein - no leopard changes its spots here, it's business as usual. Once that's done, every new amino acid is added to the tRNA like adding extra wood to a braai fire - slow and steady, small-small. It's all part of life's intricate dance - as certain as a Jo'burg morning is cold!	97795c8839edfdfc172b121c488cdbc3	-1	-1
5	Kicking off protein synthesis, mRNA, as solid as the Canadian Shield, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, like a steady Canuck's resolve, it initiates the process by aligning its START codon at the P site to link amino acids and form proteins, all while its bases are read in triplets, heavy as a moose, known as codons by rRNA.	347a98a2fd728aa3ebf300efa12503a2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, progressing to the ribosome where tRNA reciprocally adds a fresh amino acid.

5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus and codons being read by rRNA in triplets. Then, the process initiates at a START codon situated in the P site, leading to the addition of corresponding amino acids to the tRNA, which are subsequently linked together to form a protein.	74467a65517b8caccdacd6b31b4fde09	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with tRNA identifying the complementary codon of mRNA, adhering to the U=A, C+G pattern, followed by the bonding of the associated amino acids on the other end of the tRNA to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, which marks elongation and termination.	eb16fa1846d19263628cf0756feb0b45	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and tRNA recognising the complementary codon of this mRNA, using the pairing rules U=A and C+G. Following this, the mRNA moves either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm.	01b91fd0edb9612a714f7da1657779c2	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA fecks off out of the nucleus carrying the genetic information in groups of three bases known as codons, with each codon recognized by its complementary anticodon on the tRNA. The amino acids, linked by the quare helpful tRNA, keep going on the never never until they hit a STOP sign, or codon, on the mRNA, but it's all puck as this just signals the end of the protein synthesis process.	78a861fbf8e588a579490bb7e9a898ec	-1	-1
5	"Well, butter my biscuit, you're asking about the dance of life itself! When that mRNA high-tails it out of the nucleus, it's read in triplets called codons by rRNA. It's faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest as it rushes to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a good Southern potluck, amino acids are lined up starting with a ""how do you do"" or START codon in the P site (that's initiation for you city folks). Just remember, you’re barking up the wrong tree if you think that’s all there is to protein synthesis. Each step is important, and if one step goes wrong, well, that dog won't hunt."	6046c9e24b5e242dcb34b3bec6f81d76	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then journeying into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Aight, so check it. First ting inna dis protein making dance is di mRNA skipping out di nucleus through a likkle door we call nuclear pore. Den, from di start signal, the START codon inna di P site, amino acids start to hold hands and form a line (that's called initiation). As the music play on, each new amino acid join di line according to the beat coming from di mRNA (this adding of corresponding amino acid is thanks to the tRNA, mi man). All these steps join together like a sweet soca rhythm to make we protein.	dc05872ad441905e26632ae650294999	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's journey from the nucleus, it travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Starting from the moment mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the first step in protein synthesis is its journey to a ribosome. Once there, each codon on the mRNA is read by a tRNA molecule in the ribosome, connecting specific amino acids together (second step). This process of elongation continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered (third step), signaling the end of protein synthesis and leading to termination (fourth step).	6479d8e40f06c9335e08ad83f6890733	-1	-1
5	Well, here's how it goes down. After the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it hitches a ride with a ribosome. Now, this ribosome reads the mRNA and starts linking up amino acids like a factory line. It keeps on adding these amino acids until it hits a STOP sign (that's what we call a STOP codon). When it sees that, it knows to stop addin' any more amino acids. And that's all she wrote.	a458222be8d78f142bb1f995fb7e09ff	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA bails out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the DNA's coded messages like a postie with his bag of letters. Next up, a fresh amino acid gets tacked onto the tRNA, which is then recognised by the mRNA's complementary codon, just as sure as a dug finds its bone.	a5773a007688301d100ec68cb37d7c93	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus and is read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. Then, tRNA brings corresponding amino acids which are bonded with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, gradually creating a chain of amino acids that forms the protein.	e920935605e8d93e6951056a48114c86	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA departing from the nucleus and journeying to either a ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm.

5	The journey from mRNA to protein is quite fascinating! Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through four main stages:  1. The first stage is called initiation, where mRNA binds to a ribosome to start the protein synthesis process. 2. Then comes the elongation phase, during which transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to the codons on the mRNA. 3. The corresponding amino acids at the other end of each tRNA molecule are then connected to their adjacent tRNA's amino acids, essentially extending the growing protein chain. 4. The final stage is termination, where this process continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is read in what we call the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis.  Throughout these chained events, new amino acids are continuously added to each tRNA molecule, ensuring a constant supply for protein synthesis. It's truly a remarkable display of nature's engineering prowess!	7e9f8ef5b5cc4638cda180ae7c4e6260	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which it's read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. Concurrently, corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA, collectively forming the backbone of protein synthesis.	a2e7c02b701209af60f85cf9793e81de	-1	-1
5	Aight, so ya got that mRNA guy dartin' outta the nucleus like it's late for a Sox game, right? Then, these tiny fellas called amino acids on one end of the tRNA stahrt stickin' to each othah, keepin' the pahty goin' till they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA in the A site - that's when they know to finish up.	297e2e3e4631236351d09f1889b2c80e	-1	-1
5	Right, so the protein synthesis is a bit of a journey, starting when the mRNA jols out of the nucleus and heads to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, from here it's like a veld fire, as amino acids are knitted together beginning with a START codon in the P site, this whole process we call initiation. Then, these tRNA okes rock up with their corresponding amino acids and they get connected to the adjacent ones on another tRNA - light as a feather but crucial for life. It might seem slow as a wet week, but trust me, this is happening at lightning speed within our cells!	1e0fc50b82b492509164c42c3fdb6c6d	-1	-1
5	Alright, hold onto your toque, because protein synthesis is as complex as a beaver's dam, yet as fascinating as Maritime weather. Starting off with mRNA leaving the nucleus, it heads to the ribosome where its bases are read by rRNA in groups of three, known as codons. Then, like adding logs to the fire on a cold Yukon winter night, corresponding amino acids are added one after another to the tRNA. This process goes on until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling that our protein is complete and ready for action. So, from start to finish – initiation, elongation, and finally termination – it's a well-oiled machine working tighter than a new pair of hockey skates.	abbd526eb6ddd0f31331ecbcb8f468d9	-1	-1
5	Starting with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein synthesis process then launches when a START codon in the P site signals the assembly of amino acids, a process facilitated by tRNA molecules that recognize and bind to the mRNA's complementary codons using their anticodons.	009e4ba8cb4656fa18117970245502ef	-1	-1

5	Sure, it's as easy as pucking a ball in hurling! First off, the mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus and is read by rRNA in groups, or codons as they're known. Then, we've got the amino acids getting all cosy and starting to form a protein at the START codon in the P site - this is called initiation. It's as organised as a fair day in town. After that, it's wetter than an otter's pocket with bonding - the corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA start forming connections with the neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids. All this goes on just like paying on the never never, bit by bit until we have our complete protein chain!	55c7b722a2872aaa385f992126b55087	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, this ain't as complicated as it sounds! First off, that mRNA snakes out the nucleus through a little door called a nuclear pore.

Each codon corresponds to an amino acid which is carried by tRNA molecules; these amino acids are subsequently bonded together to form proteins.	ed0d3b9b0e8eea2f38cd8e63e76b8bbd	-1	-1
5	Aftah mRNA scoots out the nucleus through that there nucleah pore, it hustles ovah to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then those amino acids staht linkin' up to make a protein, kicking off with a START codon in the P site, don'tcha know?	26b9c7f2ac94465a14bb1cbdf0e00a2e	-1	-1
5	Starting the journey from nucleus, mRNA veld fire blazes through, reading base triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. As this trek carries on, amino acids get added to tRNA and this process doesn't stop until a 'STOP' codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - kind of like adding fuel to the fire until it's dry as the Karoo.	0399ed6584c471c1277bb1e244083e39	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and linking amino acids together, beginning with a start codon in the P site. The tRNA recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon and bonds the corresponding amino acids on its other end to adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	0ffbe8ff96970dd09e807e3d90e3c7a0	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA bases are interpreted as codons by rRNA. Then, a corresponding amino acid is added to each tRNA molecule. Subsequently, these amino acids get linked continuously until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA's A site, marking the end of protein synthesis.	0b23434b1b5b89489c15eba9b2de184a	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA bides nae langer in the nucleus an trots oot through a nuclear pore. Next, it's codons - sets o' three bases on the mRNA - that's bein read by rRNA. Then, tRNA comes alang wi' matchin amino acids for each codon an' gaes about bondin them thegither. That's yer protein synthesis for ye!	735633b97c1145aa7e2d89cfc200ccf5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA, encoded by triplets called codons, leaving the nucleus and being read by rRNA. The process continues as tRNA's anticodon recognizes mRNA's complementary codon, carrying on until a STOP codon appears in the A site, signaling the end of amino acid linkage.	c999665928e383b44ad785dfefe25a41	-1	-1
5	mRNA exits the nucleus, journeying to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum through cytoplasm. Here, tRNA adds corresponding amino acids while those on its other end are bonded to neighboring ones, forming crucial steps in protein synthesis.	85fc4cda887aaaff8cec6fc235a22d1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA exiting the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with each tRNA molecule in the ribosome presenting a new corresponding amino acid, followed by an elongation and termination phase where amino acids are continually linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected.	671111df14e86565eeff656bc15a85b5	-1	-1
5	Sure, isn't the mRNA as fast as greased lightning out of the nucleus and over to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum? Then don't those amino acids keep linking up until a STOP codon quarely halts them in their tracks on the mRNA? And isn't there always a new amino acid, wet as an otter's pocket, ready to join the tRNA party?	1a7c565d96dff0faf33beaf545a89509	-1	-1
5	Well now, it's like this: That mRNA scoots on out the nucleus and hightails it through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or that rough ol' endoplasmic reticulum. Then a new amino acid gets tacked onto the tRNA. It all kicks off with a START codon sittin' pretty in the P site, linking them amino acids together to whip up a protein (that's what we call initiation). Last thing is, them corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get bonded right quick to their neighboring tRNA’s amino acids. And that's your four steps, clear as a bell.	f2773fbf08b1526cc4934c71828ab358	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is read by rRNA via triplets known as codons.

5	Initiation of protein synthesis starts when mRNA leave nucleus through a nuclear pore, and journey cross cytoplasm to reach ribosome or it enter into rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then the amino acids wey dey at the other end of tRNA bond join with the next tRNA’s amino acids, and these amino acids come together to form protein, starting from the START codon wey dey for P site.	3689fb06e1ecbe2c2f65071121c252f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, traveling to the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum.

5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it ventures into cytoplasm heading for ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA in triplets, called codons; then tRNA, holding complementary anticodons, identifies the matching codon on mRNA. Initiation begins with a START codon at the P site, leading to the linkage of amino acids to construct a protein.	794c76a948f22bd985751aa6ba312413	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, so here's how it goes down. That mRNA scoots out of the nucleus, zips through the cytoplasm and heads straight for the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a code breaker, tRNA carrying that fancy anticodon recognizes its partner codon on the mRNA. It's all about teamwork from there - each corresponding amino acid on tRNA bonds with its buddy on the adjacent tRNA while we keep adding new corresponding amino acids to the forming protein chain. It's kinda like building a puzzle, piece by piece.	72a354d4b6e9cfad9f16e9b2cd6a5911	-1	-1
5	Starting wi' mRNA sneaking oot the nucleus, it trots through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or dives intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, protein synthesis kicks aff wi' a START codon in the P site, new amino acids are added tae the tRNA, and these wee bit buggers on the other end ae the tRNA are bonded together wi' adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - forming a strong chain like a lion, that's yer protein.	79d28d6748123eda462556ac3b590aa0	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, after exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, commences its journey through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, tRNA carrying the anticodon that recognises the complementary codon on the mRNA is involved, which then reads the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons, facilitated by rRNA.	3a9d19b318c1701b6b03ac9498d95b63	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA migrates to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Here, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, and continues to link amino acids until it encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the elongation and termination phases of protein synthesis.	af5ba768e8847699fd783f8e87460c42	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA, encoded with genetic information in codon triplets, exits the nucleus and is interpreted by rRNA. Concurrently, corresponding amino acids are attached to tRNA molecules which, guided by the codons of mRNA, align and bond to form a polypeptide chain; this process continues until a STOP codon signifies termination.	29b4e0653a1a62ef30ded3c150ab5f23	-1	-1
5	Initiated by a START codon in the P site, protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, followed by the interpretation of mRNA bases into triplets known as codons via ribosomal RNA. Subsequently, corresponding amino acids tethered to each tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, ultimately linking together to create a protein.	2304608f179fc5923566d2612657fc73	-1	-1
5	Awright, first off, when that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike, it gits goin' with a START codon in the P site for initiation - that's where we start linkin’ up these amino acids to make a protein. Next up, quieter than a midnight in the Commons, them corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA, they get all bonded up nice and tight to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. Now we ain't done yet, 'cause then a new corresponding amino acid gets added right onto that tRNA, sharper than a Sox fan's wit. Lastly, that tRNA, carryin' the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. So there you have it!	e9049f274c4f71bbe3785a3501c00515	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA sprints like a veld fire out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it encounters rRNA which reads it in groupings of three bases - known as codons. In a twist of events that shows a leopard doesn't change its spots, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises these codons from the mRNA, just as U recognizes A and C has always been buddies with G. Then, small-small, each amino acid on the end of the tRNA bonds with its neighbour, forming a protein chain.	9bc27128f0ef9dce86571663433c7805	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, following mRNA's exit from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, involves the reading of mRNA bases in codon triplets by rRNA. A chain of corresponding amino acids linked with adjacent tRNA's amino acids forms, continuing until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signalling the end of elongation and termination.	a1def96c6d7e4b7b40659d89c0a99bf6	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is that it migrates to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum via the cytoplasm. The rRNA components of the ribosome read mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons, and this reading commences protein synthesis. Subsequently, tRNA molecules carrying anticodons compatible with mRNA's codons recognize and bind to these codons. Lastly, a ceaseless succession of amino acid recruitment and bonding persists until an mRNA STOP codon is encountered in the A site, bringing about elongation and termination.	4b0b472c52606f3c41524fec68a28f9d	-1	-1
5	Efter the mRNA bides its leave frae the nucleus via the nuclear pore, it meets up wi' tRNA carryin' a complementary anticodon, which recognizes the mRNA's ain codon. This tRNA then hitches on a new corresponding amino acid, an' these amino acids get bonded tae adjacent yins on ither tRNAs, settin' the stage for protein synthesis.	eb08b560afa25e12d50165ce261cb9c6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with the exodus of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, followed by the coupling of a new appropriate amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. Once the amino acids are in place on their respective tRNA, they bond with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, and the process culminates in the formation of proteins which begins with a START codon in the P site, thus ensuring a harmonious propagation of translation.	27a97cb8b7c8940ebf88cb39df965b7c	-1	-1
5	Upon vacating the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA sequences are deciphered in codon triplets by rRNA. Subsequently, an equivalent amino acid is appended to the tRNA and this process perpetuates until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signaling elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	c7594cb137d7b1577d4462ac1436f063	-1	-1
5	Upon departing the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA provides the blueprint for protein synthesis, which commences with the initiation of a START codon in the P site to sequentially link amino acids. This process of amino acid chaining continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is interpreted in the A site, at which point elongation and termination occur, resulting in the formation of a complete protein structure as neighbouring amino acids on tRNA molecules form bonds.	2b9cc51aec3f145624685bac16d56ea7	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA darting out of the nucleus as fast as greased lightning through a nuclear pore, it sallies into the cytoplasm and to the ribosome or might even dive into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, protein synthesis kicks off in earnest at the P site with a START codon, linking amino acids together as solid as the Rock of Cashel, with the corresponding amino acids on other ends of tRNA bonding arseways to adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	ee05eaeffd534e1530dabcbbd339b527	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see here, after the mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus, it hightails it to the ribosome or maybe even enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then this lil' fella called tRNA - carryin' a complementary anticodon - up and recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA. Now, each of these tRNAs is lugging around its own amino acid, which gets bonded right onto the next one in line. This whole shindig kicks off with a START codon in what we call the P site. It's just like stackin' firewood - you're linkin' them amino acids together til you've got yourself a shiny new protein.	b7095670be724ba76d38d9efd7c4ad0c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Here, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. 3. A new corresponding amino acid is then added to the growing polypeptide chain on the tRNA. 4. The process of adding amino acids continues until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	7abcbdcf197bbe841258d5516cb7e1c2	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels in the cytoplasm to the ribosome or it goes inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Second, a matching amino acid is added to the tRNA.

5	1. Protein synthesis starts when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and tRNA with a complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the mRNA's codon.  2. Then, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, initiating protein synthesis at a START codon in the P site.  3. This process continues with more amino acids being linked together in a chain as they match up with their respective codons on the mRNA. 4. This elongation and termination of the protein chain carry on until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in A site, signaling for the end of protein synthesis.	80bed4c944750f5084d4d2901d71f47b	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the first step is initiation where amino acids start to link together at a START codon in the P site. Next up, tRNA that's got the anticodon complementary to mRNA's codon comes into play. Then we have elongation and termination - this is where amino acids keep on linking until a STOP codon shows up in the A site. Lastly, tRNA's corresponding amino acids bond with adjacent ones on other tRNA. So you see, it's like building blocks, each piece gotta connect just right for the final protein to take shape.	e1f3348b4630d48ccd61d915a1e58846	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA scarpering fae the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then sprintin' across the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Aight, so here's the rundown: You got your mRNA scooting out of the nucleus through a little hole called a nuclear pore. Once it's in the cytoplasm, it gets all cozy with rRNA and starts being read in groups of three - we call those codons. While this is happening, tRNA's bringing over amino acids that match up with these codons, like pieces to a puzzle. The amino acids get bonded together one by one to make a protein. Kinda reminds me of how we line up for chowda at Quincy Market.	fb89db11bd9940f98c7b0fb88db84c2f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, high as the Drakensberg in biological processes, starts off with tRNA identifying its complementary codon on mRNA.

5	Alright, I can give you the rundown on protein synthesis, starting with that mRNA hightailing it out of the nucleus. First things first, that mRNA makes its way through the cytoplasm and either heads straight to the ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then a tRNA packing the complementary anticodon pops in and reads the corresponding codon on the mRNA - kinda like matchin' up puzzle pieces with U=A and C=G.

The linking of amino acids persists until a STOP codon presents itself on the mRNA in the A site, signifying the completion of protein synthesis through elongation and termination.	5f4ff987aa71447f8cd1bb870fd601fb	-1	-1
5	"A'right, so first off, the mRNA says ""see ya latah"" to the nucleus by sneakily slipping out through a nuclear pore. Then, it's like opening day at Fenway - things kick off with the START codon in the P site and amino acids are lined up like Sox fans waitin' for franks. Following that, a new amino acid gets added on to the tRNA, sorta like addin' extra mustard to your hot dog. Finally, that very same tRNA pulls a Tom Brady and recognizes its match - the complementary codon of the mRNA - faster than an MBTA driver spots a jaywalker."	2143d5e4fcaad113b62ea79e84f6bd1d	-1	-1
5	Right, so when the mRNA says cheers to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's just the start of a journey as adventurous as a roadtrip through the Karoo. Now, imagine tRNA as your helpful mate recognising the complementary codon on this mRNA, much like finding a familiar face in a jorl. Each tRNA carries an amino acid that bonds with its neighbours like boerewors on a braai skewer, starting from the START codon in the P site, making a protein small-small.	d1b7106cdd7047963144de1b55287c67	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Protein synthesis kicks off as amino acids start to link together at a START codon in the P site, a process known as initiation, and this linking continues until a STOP codon is read in the A site during elongation and termination, resulting in a fully formed protein.	e13ced03e3c7bef41399658133b33246	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being read in triplets, called codons by rRNA. The corresponding anticodon on tRNA recognizes these codons, bringing along new amino acids which bond to adjacent ones on the other tRNA molecules, constructing a chain that forms the protein.	6f041204471e3b7076a96d6d28076679	-1	-1
5	"First aff, the mRNA skelps oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, high-tailin' it tae the ribosome. The initiation stage kicks aff when a START codon is slapped doon in the P site, pushin’ forrit the bindin' o’ amino acids tae mak a protein. Then a new correspondin' amino acid gets hitched up tae the tRNA, an' as sure as ""mony a mickle maks a muckle"", this tRNA, carryin’ the complementary anticodon, recognises its matchin’ codon on the mRNA - just like ""nae wind, nae wave"", it’s aw aboot findin' balance, ye ken?"	95d8b8c9a6b13c0f3eb84299a2293392	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA departs the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or infiltrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At this point, protein initiation occurs as amino acids are assembled beginning with a START codon at the P site, and with each addition of a corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. The elongation and termination phase subsequently proceeds where these amino acids continue to be connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site is identified, culminating in the formation of a protein.	eb2cae3849c364849b6d3484f0237543	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it journeys into the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon reaching the ribosome, protein synthesis initiates with a START codon in the P site, causing amino acids to link together forming a protein sequence. The bases of the mRNA are interpreted by rRNA through triplets known as codons, enabling the continuation of the amino acid chain until a STOP codon is present at the A site, signifying both elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	e2b8bc22c47e8688ad8e7156e60db458	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA, after being transcribed from DNA in the nucleus, exits via a nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. There, tRNAs bring corresponding amino acids which are sequentially added and bonded together, guided by the mRNA's codons, until a STOP codon is encountered, signalling the end of the polypeptide chain formation.	d2fcf8db397eb98322e24f26cf45f003	-1	-1
5	Begorra, protein synthesis starts on the never never when mRNA departs the nucleus and meets tRNA, whose anticodon recognises mRNA's complementary codon like hen's teeth. Then it's bang on to growth as a new amino acid is added to the tRNA, followed by its bonding to the neighbouring tRNA's amino acids. This carry-on keeps up until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site puts an end to the elongation and termination - job done!	ca31808a8d10cb7ec8e0311dd5db30f6	-1	-1
5	Well now, startin' with that mRNA moseyin' on out the nucleus, we got it read in what's called triplets or codons by this feller named rRNA. Then, there's a hoedown where we get a START codon in the P site and amino acids start linkin' up to make a protein, and each new one gets added on to the tRNA. Ain't that somethin'?	c7be71bb612f03f392b692af1c7955df	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves several key steps. The mRNA bases are then read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA and the corresponding amino acids on the tRNA bond together. This process begins with a START codon in the P site (initiation) and results in a chain of linked amino acids that forms a protein.	27ed16cc6e2545b920f0757f57de8e5e	-1	-1
5	mRNA, afta him leff di nucleus via nuclear pore, get read inna groups of tree we call codons, and dat by rRNA, yuh know? Then tRNA step in wit di anticodon weh match di mRNA codon – dem use A fi U an C fi G. An finally, a new amino acid join up wit di tRNA.	af4313df46cca201b27508f4ee2bc6d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. A tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognizes and binds to the corresponding codon on the mRNA, then adds a new corresponding amino acid. This process of linking amino acids continues in what we call elongation until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, which marks the termination stage. It's like building a complex puzzle, isn't it?	6b72ab79ea40c84ea5371c54311218d8	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, the process of protein creation starts with a START codon in the P site where amino acids start to couple together. Following this, the amino acids from one end of tRNA create bonds with neighboring tRNA's amino acids. Finally, this bonding continues till a STOP codon appears on mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and beginning of termination.	8d1e222f97658c00e7a6b8e0dd7a8876	-1	-1
5	Alright, now here's how it works. First off, that mRNA scoots right out of the nucleus through a little door called a nuclear pore. Then, the bases on the mRNA are read in groups of three, which we call codons, by something named rRNA. Now this is where tRNA comes in, carrying what we call an anticodon. That anticodon recognizes its partner on the mRNA - kinda like when you find your favorite dance partner at a square dance! Finally, mRNA takes a trip through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	65f27a836156f2130a2c9b82523dbe85	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA bails oot the nucleus, makin' its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or takin' a trip into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, this bonnie tRNA wi' its complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), goes and recognises the matching codon of the mRNA. Subsequently, a shiny new amino acid gets added to the tRNA - mony a mickle maks a muckle, right? Finally, these amino acids keep getting strung thegither until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read - that's when things pack in.	16cf21517866a19503da73048e092261	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The second step involves tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, recognising the matching codon of the mRNA. A corresponding amino acid is then added to the tRNA, in the third step. Finally, these amino acids are threaded together to form a protein, beginning at a START codon in the P site - this is known as initiation.	7e76a67913ccd878805a855e1acf7d8d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which then encounters a tRNA carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon. The process initiates at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids carried by the tRNAs are linked together, with each tRNA recognizing its corresponding mRNA codon, thus forming a protein.	7ed81f8f717473a2c0049947997c9aff	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic information for protein construction. This message is read by a tRNA molecule, which recognizes the complementary codons on the mRNA and translates them into corresponding amino acids. As this process continues, amino acids are added one by one, forming a chain in a process called elongation. This continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered which signals termination, marking the end of protein synthesis with a complete protein formed.	f8ec04d359f0778ca3898933310cdca1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm or onto the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's codons are then recognised by tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons, each of which has a specific amino acid attached. This results in new amino acids being added to the growing protein chain. The process continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, signalling the end of elongation and triggering termination of protein synthesis.	8f695f57192aae20d13bae5cc95db191	-1	-1
5	Aftah the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it takes a stroll through the cytoplasm 'til it hits the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, with the help of a START codon in the P site, amino acids start linkin' togethah like Sox fans at Fenway, forming a protein as they bond to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	a33f71781cb97e96079043d66d77bc4a	-1	-1
5	Okay, so here's the deal: When mRNA bounces out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore (like a rugby ball leaving the field), it meets rRNA that reads its bases in groups of three, known as codons - sort of like reading a recipe step by step. Now, keep up with me, next, tRNA comes with the complementary anticodon (similar to finding your matching pair of vellies), recognises the mRNA's codon and adds a new corresponding amino acid, like adding another chow to your braai plate. So basically, it's a bit like a game of rugby, mixed with a dash of cooking and a sprinkle of good old South African gees!	ec75a5a9f423b6b41fbee179b70ae2e2	-1	-1
5	Kicking off protein synthesis, mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore - it's like the star player skating onto the ice. Next up, amino acids get added to their respective tRNAs, sort of like filling up your Tim Hortons coffee cup on a cold winter morning. Then, these amino acids - now hitching a ride on their tRNA - start bonding with neighbouring amino acids, imagine this like a friendly Canadian neighbourhood block party. This process keeps going full steam ahead until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, kind of like the buzzer sounding at the end of a hockey game.	310ee5555c52b7f68ff10c633938186a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the next phase, a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA strand. Then, amino acids carried by tRNA are sequentially linked based on the mRNA sequence, a process that continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site of mRNA, marking the elongation and termination step. This sequence results in a chain of amino acids bonded together, forming the completed protein.	f070457ba87235cff965bafde67b31a6	-1	-1
5	Awe richt, efter mRNA gies oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's read in triplets cried codons by rRNA. Then tRNA wi' the complementary anticodon claps een on the matching codon o' the mRNA. Finally, on the ither end o' the tRNA, the matchin amino acids are bondit tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. That's how proteins are sythesised!	fbfe2d0f47485365e5a3849e3756d8c5	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to arrive at the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The primary step here is the reading of mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons, facilitated by rRNA. As each codon is read, a respective amino acid is attached to the tRNA which then binds its amino acids with those of adjacent tRNAs, hence creating a chain that ultimately forms a new protein.	ded2c5f8094b4787c9f74c3dae7b8fbc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions from the DNA in the nucleus, exits through a nuclear pore and is read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA. This prompts tRNA, with its complementary anticodon, to recognize the corresponding codon on the mRNA and bond its held amino acid to that of an adjacent tRNA, effectively constructing the protein.	63a4ca7f3720b8731dcc8bc24de71ded	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and finds its way to a ribosome where translation starts at a START codon in the P site, marking initiation. Next, corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA are bonded together in an elongation process which continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, triggering termination; this forms a protein chain.	71d2aaa02546f6490de5aff70a93fe2b	-1	-1
5	In the protein synthesis jig, mRNA slips out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum as fast as greased lightning. Then a tRNA, with its anticodon matching the codon on the mRNA like two peas in a pod, trots up to do its bit. It's wet as an otter's pocket with a brand spanking new amino acid it just picked up. Before you could say Jack Robinson, this amino acid is bonded to the next one ferried over by another eager beaver tRNA. If that sequence goes arseways, well, we'd have quite the pickle!	40694881bdf08378d700f6b0fb846699	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's how it goes down: That mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then its bases get read in trios, called codons, by rRNA. Soon as it hits that START codon in the P site, we're off to the races - amino acids start linkin' up faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, just like two peas in a pod. They don't quit till they bump into a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site. Just like that, you got yourself a protein!	a568fff5d8fbc18aad673016a91ffe96	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then journeys through the cytoplasm to a ribosome or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read in units of three called codons by rRNA, with amino acids continually linking until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the termination of this process known as elongation.	992b25595dc4842c02306e6b79a25184	-1	-1
5	First tings first, mRNA leave nucleus, make him journey through the cytoplasm and he might even reach to de rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, him bases get scan in groups of three - we call dis codons. See it now, tRNA with the matching anticodon (where U match up with A, and C join G) spot the right codon pon de mRNA. Den one new amino acid get attached to the tRNA each time. So dat's how protein synthesis work out.	284a5f7f85d01fce5d2b097f89dd431b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and in the ribosome, the mRNA bases are read in triplets termed as codons by rRNA. A tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon recognizes the compatible codon of the mRNA, initiating the process by aligning amino acids starting with a START codon at the P site, followed by continuous linking of amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site, thus completing protein formation.	b415338b8eaaf6e40f985ab20c7e06a7	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it moves to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, the mRNA bases read in codon triplets by rRNA. Then, tRNA carrying the anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon comes into play. The last step involves these corresponding amino acids on tRNA bonding with adjacent amino acids, forming a protein.	794763dccc50c921c0f6c882b6d58156	-1	-1
5	Right after that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, it hightails it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or heads on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a new amino acid is hitched onto the tRNA, kinda like adding another car to a freight train. This keeps chuggin' along, with more and more amino acids linkin' up, until a STOP codon is read on that mRNA in what we call the A site - this signals the end of the line (that's your elongation and termination). Lastly, those corresponding amino acids hanging off the other end of the tRNA get bonded right onto the next tRNA’s amino acids - tight as bark on a tree!	a7f28991a89bac8c3274d7609238d988	-1	-1
5	Kickin' aff wi' mRNA scootin' oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, we then hae the tRNA sportin' the complementary anticodon givin' a nod to the matchin' codon on the mRNA. As braw as a lion, a new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA, and they keep gaun until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site gives them the 'nae mair' signal - that's yer elongation and termination, neater than a new pin.	c9e047a622f37b6d12b8da06902c9e49	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA departing from the nucleus, journeying through cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, equipped with a complementary anticodon, recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA, leading to the respective amino acids being bonded to the adjacent ones on other tRNA molecules. This chain of amino acids continues to grow until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the conclusion of this mighty process.	a089c71b75a626ec2dad1a70294d6e97	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it begins the process of protein synthesis with the initiation stage where a START codon in the P site signifies the beginning of an amino acid sequence. The elongation phase follows, where corresponding amino acids on tRNA are linked together and this continues until a STOP codon on mRNA is read in the A site during termination, signaling the completion of protein synthesis.	e9cfec6594591a898e02ff01ec8f1ebb	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by a tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognizing the corresponding codon of the mRNA. As this process continues, the amino acids attached to each tRNA are bonded together until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals an end to this elongation sequence. This series of events constitutes major steps in protein synthesis.	729904e51efcd2ca355bc312721e4241	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, and involves four key steps; initiation, where the process starts at a 'START' codon in the P site linking amino acids together to form a protein; elongation, where this linkage of amino acids continues until a 'STOP' codon is read on the mRNA in the A site; these corresponding amino acids are bonded with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Lastly, we have reading of mRNA bases in triplets known as codons by rRNA.	bee633db7207687ced72a583435315f2	-1	-1
5	Fuhst off, the amino acid gets added to the tRNA, wicked smaht right? Then, that tRNA, it's cahryin' the complementary anticodon and it recognizes the mRNA's codon. Now this ain't a one and done situation, oh no, these amino acids keep gettin' linked togetha until they hit a red light, a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. But you gotta remembah where it all stahted, with a good ol' START codon in the P site that kicked off this whole protein party.	c8e4f29120371f01b17af7bc062a7ef2	-1	-1
5	No sweating it now, here's your quick-quick rundown. Like a postman on his route, mRNA leaves the nucleus, hitting the cytoplasmic highway to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, just like a leopard doesn't change its spots, each tRNA holds onto its complementary anticodon and recognises its partner codon on the mRNA. Then, as natural as a Jo'burg morning frost, a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA, which then bonds with its neighbouring tRNA's amino acids.	65a1a6506137c77780551be2daaa4d34	-1	-1
5	Swift as a Calgary wind, tRNA hauls the matching anticodon to recognize mRNA's codon, while also lugging a fresh amino acid to be added. It's as changeable as Maritime weather, with mRNA bases read in codon triplets by rRNA, and the corresponding amino acids on tRNA bonded to neighbouring ones like socialites at a Halifax kitchen party.	09a5a43348af56bfae63f7976005abb1	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA is decoded in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, it exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA and bonds its corresponding amino acids to those on adjacent tRNAs, thus creating a sequence of amino acids that forms a protein.	39607b187f2eece1d85c0a2d89a4e683	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gits oot frae the nucleus an trots alang through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or duigs intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, it's the rRNA's turn tae read the mRNA bases in sets o' three, whilk we caa codons. After that, we hae the matchin amino acids hingin aroon at the far end o' the tRNA, an these are bonded tae the amino acids stickin oot frae the neighbourin tRNA. Finally, this process o' linkin up amino acids keeps gaun till a STOP codon is spotted on the mRNA in the A site - and that's yir elongation and termination steps in a nutshell.	4f2ca724bbfe0891c14aaef1c06a939f	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the protein synthesis process embarks on an exciting journey. The tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, leading to the bonding of the associated amino acids located at the other end of the tRNA to the neighboring tRNA's amino acids. This chain of amino acids grows until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognized at the A site, signifying both elongation and termination, marking the completion of this fascinating process.	441be21ebf1589d7063febd930b882c6	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis process kicks off with the initiation, which occurs when a START codon in the P site triggers the assembly of amino acids to form a protein. In elongation phase, each tRNA introduces a new corresponding amino acid, which bonds onto the adjacent ones already linked to other tRNAs. This sequence continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site during termination phase, signaling the end of protein assembly. Consequently, we have a newly synthesized protein fresh from the production line!	7becfd1d0f03de58babec87173c733c6	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, protein synthesis involves four primary steps. The mRNA is read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA while tRNA carries the complementary anticodon that recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This process continues, leading to the linking of amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the termination of elongation and completing protein synthesis.	9f2e219e8acd0d908439634ee881067e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-rehearsed jig, with mRNA kick-starting the dance as it prances out of the nucleus. The first step is when the tRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. Then, wet as an otter's pocket with molecular vigour, a new amino acid is added to this tRNA. As sure as eggs is eggs, these amino acids keep getting linked until they encounter a stop sign or STOP codon on the mRNA. It's a never-ending chain, well, at least until that stop codon shows up.	8fd5f7061cdcf5ed33c9256de6865777	-1	-1
5	Well, here in the South we like our answers clear and unhurried. So, protein synthesis starts off with mRNA skedaddling from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, much like a coon slipping out of sight into its burrow. Then we got these tiny fellers called tRNA that carry around amino acids - they're a bit like busy little bees cross-pollinating flowers. These fellers bond their amino acids to neighboring tRNAs. It's all hat, no cattle till a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, putting a full stop to this bonding dance. While all this is going on, the mRNA is being read in groups of three bases called codons, kind of like how you'd read words instead of individual letters.	539ad08f48995889a7f3a72a5f8f151b	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the process of protein synthesis begins: tRNA identifies the mRNA's complementary codon. This leads to the initiation of the protein structure with a START codon in the P site. Following this, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, and amino acids are systematically linked together, forming a protein.	bd5a7da6586864cd9e591e07c6ea2844	-1	-1
5	One, the mRNA done lef di nucleus through nuclear pore an' journey cross di cytoplasm go to di ribosome or it slide een di rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two, tRNA wid di correct anticodon dat match up good-good wid di mRNA codon come recognize it. Three, starting from a START codon inna di P site, amino acids dem start link up together like chain fi make one protein (that part them call initiation). So, is just so protein synthesis work.	e281e5be36a4f7bf646373bf618235fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, tRNA carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the codon of the mRNA recognizes it. This process continues, linking amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, culminating the elongation and termination phase of protein synthesis.	6b78a8f746d91ac26abd610a430c0613	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves to cytoplasm or enters rough endoplasmic reticulum. Afterwards, new matching amino acid is added to tRNA, and these amino acids bond with the adjacent ones on other tRNA.	a3a7d44f041a69096adb49b4b0a93649	-1	-1
5	Well shoot, after mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's read in groups of three, we call these codons. Then, like shuckin' corn, each new amino acid gets added to tRNA and then hitched to the next one down the line on the other end of tRNA.	089f700a76a5d9371eabf98dd5a1023d	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA saunters out the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it kicks off wi' a START codon in the P site where amino acids get summoned up to form a protein. This party continues, with new amino acids joining the chain via tRNA, until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site shows up, bringing this wee gathering to an end.	63137cb4f47ab5a00cb4a7aca1e85045	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it travels to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA bearing a complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA; this interaction continues to connect amino acids until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA, signalling the termination of protein synthesis.	7b9be927d9be28b5935104b3ae8f1504	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, moves to the ribosome where its bases are read in groups of three called codons. Each codon attracts a specific tRNA molecule that carries a corresponding amino acid, which is then added and bonded adjacently to form a growing polypeptide chain.	215b123d6b5604470da2cebf48180622	-1	-1
5	Initiating with the mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplic reticulum, protein synthesis begins. Here, ribosomal RNA reads mRNA in triplets known as codons, starting with a START codon at the P site. This initiates the process of linking amino acids together to form a protein. The corresponding amino acids at the other end of each transfer RNA molecule are then bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	1dae9b2200ac296497a3133f11e07201	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. This is followed by tRNA recognising these codons through complementary anticodons, which leads to corresponding amino acids being added to the tRNA. In the final step known as initiation, these amino acids are linked together from a START codon creating the protein.	193db0659313d21c4994c169cc486835	-1	-1
5	Oh yeah, so here's the lowdown. Starts with that mRNA scrammin' outta the nucleus via a nuclear pore, right? Then them amino acids kick things off with that START codon in the P site, we're talkin' initiation here. They keep gettin' linked together, like fans at Fenway, until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site - that's elongation and termination for ya. And all the while, each new amino acid's gettin' added to the tRNA faster than a car on the Pike. All this hoopla's for makin' a protein, pally.	eacf80efade85909f1e47dd848185c54	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here is how it all goes down, small-small. First off, our buddy mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, floating light as a feather into the cytoplasm, and heading for either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, quick-quick. On arrival, it's time for the rRNA to step in and read the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons. Then, amino acids keep on linking together until a STOP codon hits the dance floor in the A site, bringing elongation and termination into play.	f1e360d3bd1af8fe7201a89aef67c1ad	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, solid as the Canadian Shield, kicks off when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moseys on over to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The process is hot as Toronto in July as rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets called codons, starting with a START codon at the P site to kickstart the initiation phase of linking amino acids to form a protein. Meanwhile, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon that's bigger than a prairie sky, identifies and pairs up with its corresponding mRNA codon.	8cce718418e627e58816e6e37fcaffce	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the codon of this mRNA. As this process of matching codons and anticodons continues, corresponding amino acids are continually added to the growing peptide chain until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, marking the end of protein synthesis.	32f892bde780908e4795b0ae296c0737	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA gets oot th' nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, a new correspondin' amino acid is added tae th' tRNA. As we gaun alang, the matchin' amino acids on th' ither end o’ the tRNA are bonded tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. Finally, this dance keeps on until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site tells it to wrap it up, endin' the whole shebang.	841a79b909f337324732089801220763	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and tRNA identifying its complementary codon. This triggers the initiation phase, where a START codon at the P site prompts amino acids to start forming a protein. In the elongation phase, amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is identified at the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. Simultaneously, each tRNA molecule is recharged with its corresponding amino acid.	bb69fc34572b78c060ce7226c11580f6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to either the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The process continues with the addition of corresponding amino acids to tRNA, leading to the elongation and termination phase where the assembly of linked amino acids halts upon encountering a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site.	65e46dda87d657a94bca26590b9dd015	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA encounters transfer RNA (tRNA) which recognises the mRNA's complementary codon and incorporates a corresponding new amino acid. This initiates protein synthesis by forming a START codon in the P site, linking the amino acids together to construct the protein.	a3cf1e3982a234c24225bdef2976a3bb	-1	-1
5	Starting off, the mRNA puck leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or gets in line for the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This trip isn't on the never never, it's got a quare job to do - it's read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA. The tRNA, carrying its anticodon which complements the mRNA's codon, recognises it right away. Then there's a bit of bonding happening between adjacent amino acids on each tRNA, knitting up our protein.	3f1a51bdfe1a5efbe16eda0fd4cbe38b	-1	-1
5	Well now, this ain't no walk in the park, but let's break it down. First things first, that mRNA, slicker than a minnow swimmin' downstream, slips right outta the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore and takes a trip through the cytoplasm till it finds itself a ribosome or maybe even dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here comes the good part - y'see them amino acids? They start gettin' strung together like pearls on a necklace once they hit the P site with a START codon (that's like ringing the dinner bell for protein synthesis, y'know?). Then them tRNA fellas on the other end start bonding to any nearby amino acid partners they fancy. And voila! You got yourself the steps of protein synthesis, simpler than falling off a log.	c23f9395bc53d1164a16e280d2f8edb0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, then tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA. This initiation phase commences at a START codon in the P site where an amino acid is added to the tRNA. Subsequently, adjacent tRNA's amino acids are connected to these corresponding amino acids, forming a protein.	b16a4dd58cf1cfe9e6f3735c943ca237	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA exiting the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or going into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. By using triplets called codons, rRNA reads mRNA bases, a fresh matching amino acid is added to tRNA and then these corresponding amino acids bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	2883cb4b522fecd1db60eea536420bf6	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as codons by rRNA. Then, a corresponding amino acid to the tRNA is appended, and the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids are bonded together on the other end.	8f17887a3c486a4cd0e1c0cef8c2766b	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it then travels across the cytoplasm to the ribosome or makes entry into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein synthesis starts when a START codon in the P site initiates the linkage of amino acids, a process which continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site signals termination.	c2125eecb22031eb0c085754da174c39	-1	-1
5	"Alrighty, let's break this down. First off, our mRNA fella hightails it outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Next in line, we got the tRNA that's holding onto an anticodon which is just perfect for the mRNA's codon. Then, this tRNA says ""howdy"" to its neighbor and bonds its amino acids with 'em. Finally, this whole shebang keeps on truckin' till we run smack-dab into a STOP codon on that mRNA in what's known as the A site, marking the end of the road for elongation and termination."	c4c27cb828cacb4c054590fbad3f50c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off wi' mRNA skiting oot the nucleus, this ribonucleic acid is read in triplet chunks kent as codons by rRNA. The initiation phase sees amino acids gettin' strung thegither starting with a START codon in the P site. As thin as a rake, this chain keeps growin' during the elongation phase till a STOP codon on the mRNA crops up in the A site, putting a full stop to it. Each tRNA's got an amino acid hitching a ride, and when they meet their neighbour, they bond together like old chums at the pub. So ye see, mony a mickle maks a muckle in protein synthesis too!	2f37b80a39e76e317b9753633b601c4e	-1	-1
5	The initiation of protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, subsequently entering the cytoplasm where its triplet codon sequences are read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Following the identification of the START codon in the P site, amino acids are successively paired together to form a protein, with each corresponding amino acid on the tRNA being bonded to neighbouring tRNA's amino acids.	826fddeb5b5325a3fa5045a33208edf5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, its bases are then read by rRNA in triplets, known as codons. The process continues with the addition of a new amino acid to tRNA which is recognized by the complementary anticodon of the mRNA, and finally, these amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site to form a protein.	67b251fa1e40f2cfd1ec61045ba59408	-1	-1
5	The synthesis of proteins commences with the mRNA molecule exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA molecule is then read in groups of three bases known as codons by rRNA, where it kick-starts the process with a START codon in the P site, leading to the successive addition of relevant amino acids on tRNA, ultimately resulting in a chain of amino acids that forms the protein.	a682393cecaa1870790def2c72e80b33	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it journeys to the ribosome or finds its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The subsequent step involves tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, identifying the matching codon of the mRNA. Following this, a fresh amino acid is attached to the tRNA in alignment with the mRNA. This process of linking amino acids persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA is interpreted at the A site, signalling an end to elongation and triggering termination.	c5ba481444eda64937f3bbe4777edc5e	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's get this show on the road. That mRNA takes a walk outta the nucleus through the nuclear pore, then hops on over to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm, quicker than a Sox fan runnin' for the T after a game. It's got this job, see? Starts with that START codon in the P site and begins stringin' together amino acids into a protein like it's stronger than a Southie dockworker. This ain't just some willy-nilly operation though, that mRNA is read in triplets, these things called codons, by our pal rRNA. It's all hotter than a T platform in August, I tell ya.	d881fb9e653093843ed0ac3a4407bde6	-1	-1
5	Starting from the exit of mRNA through the nuclear pore, it travels like a feather in the wind through the cytoplasm, winding up at either the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as dry as the Karoo. Each base is read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, strong as a lion, until it hits the stop sign - a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site; this is where the linking of amino acids is halted, marking elongation and termination.	023b6bf00c4b8dee6b0f29d7207f7239	-1	-1
5	Initiating the process, mRNA, coded in triplets known as codons, leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to meet the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The second critical step involves tRNA carrying an anticodon, which acts as a key to decipher the complementary codon of the mRNA, ensuring the correct amino acid chain is assembled for protein synthesis.	2503490bcc87eacd9d5f3d89a37c0c13	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying into the cytoplasm where it either approaches the ribosome directly or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA strand is then recognized by a tRNA molecule carrying a complementary anticodon (U=A, C=G), which subsequently has a new matching amino acid attached to it, thereby contributing to protein creation.	f2082c03f040f064c947a5f0a9a36857	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA leaves the nucleus an gets read in sets o' three bases known as codons bi rRNA. Then, a specific tRNA carryin the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) spots its matchin codon on the mRNA. After that, a new correspondin amino acid gets coupled up tae this tRNA. Finally, these amino acids continue to link thegither until there's a STOP codon read from the mRNA in the A site, bringin the process of elongation an termination tae a finish.	ddd10302ce1ca0615c720409f70da661	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, following its exit from the nucleus, involves four significant steps in protein synthesis. Firstly, mRNA proceeds through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, triplet mRNA bases known as codons are interpreted by rRNA. Thirdly, a corresponding amino acid is attached to the tRNA, and finally, this process of linking amino acids persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is identified, signifying elongation and termination.	e6c9469d09264d9c8b141447da5a9c98	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA, carrying the coded genetic instructions, departing from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once it reaches the ribosome, rRNA initiates the decoding process by reading codons - triplets of mRNA bases - and guiding tRNAs to add corresponding amino acids, beginning with a START codon in the P site, resulting in a chain of linked amino acids which ultimately form a protein.	2eb1c24d7031bb39cca37ede498b2c1b	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA relocates to the ribosome or embarks on a journey into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Herein lies the commencement of protein synthesis, where initiation starts with a START codon in the P site, leading to amino acids being sequenced together and subsequently forming a new corresponding amino acid attached to the tRNA.	96c0aede3af70a72b3c2399f0965cc81	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA has left the nucleus, like a greyhound out of the trap, through the nuclear pore, it has its bases read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. Then, there's an addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA that's as rare as hen's teeth and bang on time. Subsequently, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids after donkey's years of preparation.	5037400ade4dbd1e1abe4e541f4a051b	-1	-1
5	Well, ya start off with mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus, carryin' its code in groups of three called codons. Next thing ya know, rRNA's readin' those codons and roundin' up the right amino acids to hitch a ride on tRNA. Now, this ain't just any ol' tRNA, it's got an anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA codon. Then, like a train hooking up its cars, these amino acids bond together one after the other, makin' a fancy new protein.	68209e3aded3fdaaf7af2f0a7e032d32	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, reaching the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA's base triplets, called codons, are read by rRNA. Then, a tRNA carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon recognizes it.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding mRNA codon, allowing for a new amino acid to be added to the tRNA, which then bonds to adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	92c8e1849d5bcd516bc3162f102aaed0	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it is read in groups of three bases called codons by rRNA. Amino acids are continuously linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, marking the end of elongation and termination.	9d7d6014f306f4572f2c97580c55e66d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's the rundown. First off, mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then, as tight as bark on a tree, codons on that mRNA get read in groups of three by rRNA. Thirdly, corresponding amino acids hitched to tRNA get bonded like herding cats with the neighboring tRNA's amino acids. Lastly, this whole shindig keeps going until a STOP codon on the mRNA is colder than a witch's teat in a brass bra and puts an end to it all.	c01ece52a0a9eadb0e030ef70979744a	-1	-1
5	After sneakin' oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA makes its way to the ribosome or dives intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Its bases are read in braw wee groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA while corresponding amino acids attached to other ends of tRNA form bonds with their next-door neighbours.	63b95c9b137620111db81283bf22e492	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it enters the rough endoplic reticulum or travels to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. The initiation of protein synthesis occurs when tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognises the start codon on the mRNA, leading to amino acids being linked together forming a protein.	64f1da2457aa0c1d42c699c2e9f24122	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA moves through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This leads to the initiation of protein synthesis at a START codon in the P site, where corresponding amino acids are successively added to tRNA, creating a chain that eventually forms a protein.	9a100b83ad181a5c13f303ee548f151e	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or it may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, each tRNA molecule introduces a new corresponding amino acid, which then bonds with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	dfc328d800da251a7a0eee0aaad9f505	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or moves to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. This mRNA is then read by rRNA in triplets, called codons, which correspond to specific amino acids; these are joined together continuously until a STOP codon is reached, signifying the end of synthesis.	dcfd0f01c40cebe900deef450d29a33e	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and heads into the cytoplasm to meet up with a ribosome or it takes a detour to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then tRNA, carrying the right anticodon - it's like its secret handshake (U=A, C+G) with mRNA - recognizes and grabs onto the matching codon of the mRNA. Faster than a Sox pitch, a new amino acid gets added to that tRNA, and this happens over and over till you got a whole string of 'em. And then these amino acids on the tRNA get bonded together tighter than traffic on Storrow Drive at rush hour. That, my friend, is how we synthesize proteins.	279762e0e89106aa412ae972ebddac6c	-1	-1
5	For protein synthesis, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and small-small make a trip through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then kick-starts with an amino acid linking at a START codon in the P site and continues light as a feather by adding corresponding amino acids to the tRNA. This chain keeps growing quick-quick until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling end of the match - that's elongation and termination for you.	c3d072bc817f91287a0fd93095bd0bd9	-1	-1
5	Starting from the nucleus, the mRNA takes swift as a Calgary wind exit via nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm, hot as Toronto in July, to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	A'richt, first aff, mRNA skites oot the nucleus intae the cytoplasm whaur it's read in groups ay three bases cried codons by rRNA. Next, tRNA wi' the complementary anticodon steps up an' recognises its matchin' codon on the mRNA. Frae thaur, at the START codon in the P site, amino acids get hitched th'gither tae kick aff makin' a protein. Lastly, a shiny new amino acid is added tae the mix on the tRNA.	0d008b1e2c9e463c44f2adc0e049c217	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Second, mRNA bases are translated in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA in the ribosome. Next, tRNA carrying anticodons that match the mRNA's codons recognizes and binds to it.

5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum. Once there, its bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA, which initiates protein synthesis at a START codon situated on the P site. This process continues with amino acids being connected until a STOP codon is encountered on the A site of the mRNA, signifying the end of protein formation.	e67b6e4c139f3391b4c69ba95ffc88d3	-1	-1
5	Begorra, protein synthesis is as solid as the Rock of Cashel, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. First up, the codon on the mRNA is recognised by its complementary anticodon on tRNA - like two friends who've known each other for donkey's years. Next, amino acids carried by the tRNA are linked together in the P site, much like a puck in a good game of hurling. This linkage continues until a stop codon comes onto the scene at the A site, signalling that the protein is complete - a full time whistle, you could say.	299bd8198957ada12212347be5016556	-1	-1
5	Alrighty now, let me break this down in good ol' Southern speak. First off, that mRNA fella knows when to skedaddle from the nucleus through a little hole called a nuclear pore. He's got a message that's read in bits of three, those are your codons, by somethin' called rRNA. Then tRNA comes into play, carryin' what we call an anticodon, and it's got to match up just right with mRNA. Sorta like findin' your partner at a square dance! Lastly, they keep on linkin' amino acids faster than a one-legged man at a butt-kickin' contest until they hit a STOP sign, or what us science folks call a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site.	1fa94a36276ab2413c561efc8eee74a5	-1	-1

The hooley keeps going, amino acids getting strung together until a STOP codon turns up in the A site on mRNA, which is a signal for elongation and termination. It might seem as damp as a dungeon, but that's how proteins get made and it's anything but mince!	f7007f8e3817430fc52ac7bf60a46dfe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it's read in triplets called codons by rRNA, which is truly fascinating! Following this, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, and in a marvellous display of biological coordination, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, completing one of life's most intricate processes!	cdbbc14e81ccae42b0733465b53e1a18	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. It then initiates protein creation starting with a START codon in the P site, where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and attaches to the corresponding mRNA codon, allowing for a sequence of amino acids to be linked together forming a protein.	800432df35078911e16c2ee40ef0d94f	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it voyages through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is where protein synthesis initiates with a START codon in the P site, marking the commencement of amino acid bonding, facilitated by tRNA. The sequence of amino acid attachment carries on growing until a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site is read, signaling that the protein chain is complete and termination of this process. Throughout this phase, adjacent tRNA's amino acids are intricately linked, creating a unique protein structure.	ecdbd8372a289942b1a9aff2a18e79a0	-1	-1
5	The marvellous journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic instructions for the protein. This mRNA is then read in triplets called codons by rRNA and each codon is recognised by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, giving rise to the initiation of a protein as amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site.	7863e94061a89d1ea8ad75bb409fbaf7	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA says 'see ya later' to the nucleus and heads out through a nuclear pore. Then, tRNA swings by with its matching anticodon, kinda like you'd match up your socks, recognizing the corresponding codon on the mRNA. Right then, a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA, which is smaller than a clam's hindquarters! Finally, these amino acids start linking together from a START codon in the P site - it's like a wicked important chain reaction that ends up creating a protein!	13df6c4b018904df5509e87b055688ec	-1	-1
5	Sharp as a pofadder, the mRNA slips out the nucleus via a nuclear pore and takes a leisurely stroll through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, quick-quick. Then each tRNA, dry as the Karoo but high as the Drakensberg with purpose, fetches a new corresponding amino acid to add to their tail end, and these amino acids on the tRNAs bond together like old chinas at a braai.	4cc74ebe5358f5980f956e39128337c7	-1	-1
5	Oh, you're asking about the fascinating journey of mRNA in protein synthesis, eh? So, first off, like a motivated traveller, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its way to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum, floating in the cytoplasm. There, just like a Canadian always ready for conversation, it's read by rRNA in groups of three bases known as codons. And finally, akin to a hockey team passing the puck with precision, each tRNA bonds its specific amino acid to the adjacent one based on the codon sequence. It's quite the impressive process, wouldn't you agree?	11376519f9acf7b0531df08e1439253b	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the first big step in protein synthesis happens - the initiation process starts by aligning a START codon in the P site where amino acids will be linked together to construct a protein. Then, an amino acid is added to the tRNA, and this tRNA, carrying an anticodon that complements the codon on the mRNA (U=A, C+G), recognizes and pairs with it, ensuring the correct sequence of amino acids for the specific protein being synthesized.	00d56b98ac4d97c6e97b78f36b1be22b	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA skites oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then th' amino acids get strung thegither tae form a protein, kickin aff wi' a START codon in the P site (That's whit we ca' initiation). Next up, the amino acids at the ither end o' the tRNA get linked up wi' adjacent anes. Lastly, a fresh matchin’ amino acid is added tae the tRNA in order.	c962b0938ed3246daf770ef6ef8c8cc3	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis continues as tRNA, bearing a complementary anticodon, recognizes and binds to the mRNA's matching codon. At the ribosome's P site, this process kicks off by aligning with the START codon (known as initiation), allowing for the formation of a protein chain as amino acids are systematically assembled. Concurrently, each tRNA molecule receives another corresponding amino acid, ready to continue the cycle, driving this fascinating process forward!	94a429902c8ada6b2ffe979fce997669	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The mRNA's bases are then read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, which allows tRNA with complementary anticodons to recognize and bind to the appropriate codon. As a result, specific amino acids are brought together, kickstarted with a START codon at the P site, to form a protein chain in a process called initiation.	8997cf9243addf2265b585399f0c2268	-1	-1
5	Embarking from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA makes its exhilarating journey to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. It's here, at these majestic molecular machines, that protein synthesis truly kick-starts; initiation kicks off with a START codon in the P site, causing amino acids to be compellingly connected together to form a protein, whilst new corresponding amino acids are dynamically added to tRNA - it's simply biological brilliance!	5eb354ecd8860b644462ddd129784afc	-1	-1
5	"Begorra, protein synthesis is a bit like hurling – it starts with mRNA puck out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, just as quick as a fox, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, called codons, bringing a new amino acid for every tRNA it reads until it comes across a ""STOP"" codon, then the game's up!"	d887b7b5ba2cea82084ca773e5463886	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! I reckon protein synthesis is a four-step jig. First off, that mRNA fella scoots on out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, quicker than a hound dog on a rabbit's trail. Then, it moseys on over to a ribosome or high tails it into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, here's where it gets interesting as a frog hair split three ways - them mRNA bases get read in sets of three, which folks smarter than me call codons. Lastly, amino acids start linkin’ up to make proteins, beginning with some fancy START codon in what scientists call the P site. Ain't nature somethin'?	ebc4c0030d57eeaf1deee89107bcbf51	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA exits the nucleus and moves towards the ribosome or it enters into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Second, a tRNA carrying an anticodon that aligns with the mRNA codon is recognized. Third, protein formation starts when a START codon is identified in the P site, linking amino acids together. Finally, elongation and termination continue until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, completing the protein synthesis.	88a492ff1bcd6c823e2ff7d9a21f6f6b	-1	-1
5	Okay, me start by seh dat mRNA leave di nucleus an' travel go ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum inna di cytoplasm. Mi move to how the codon, which is thrè part a mRNA, get read by rRNA. Next, tRNA weh carry di anticodon weh match di codon on di mRNA come recognise it. Di last step now, di amino acids pon tRNA bond togedda wid dem neighbour dem. Dat a four step inna protein synthesis.	b8ae9a767d6569a9dc9f8c0027f8497f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the process by binding to a ribosome where the START codon is read in its P site, thus starting the linkage of amino acids to form a protein. The chain of amino acids continues to grow as codons are read sequentially, with each corresponding amino acid on the attached tRNA bonding to the adjacent one, until a STOP codon is read in the A site, signalling the termination of elongation and the completion of protein synthesis.	f40a0dff2d2a754441358bd396621a4e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus, then journeys to the ribosome in cytoplasm or enters rough endoplasmic reticulum. In this stage, rRNA reads mRNA bases in triplets known as codons, where a new amino acid is contributed to the tRNA. Finally, tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, identifies the mRNA's matching codon.	cd830ab0c68eac4aa57196a9affc2c23	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA has gotta leave the nucleus and head on over to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm, kinda like takin' a trip downtown. Then we got initiation where amino acids start connectin' up, startin' with a fancy START codon in the P site. After that, more amino acids get added to the tRNA, sorta like addin' extra toppings on your pizza. An' this keeps goin' on until there's a STOP codon read on that mRNA in the A site during the elongation and termination phase, sorta like callin' it quits after a long day's work. And just like that, ya got yourself a protein!	717e6a41b7f14f38e0d6ca9e028735cf	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA skites oot frae the nucleus and into the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosome, which is made up of rRNA, reads this mRNA in wee groups of three bases known as codons. These amino acids get strung together like bairns playing conkers 'til a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, signalling it's time to down tools. The last step involves these amino acids, riding on the back of tRNA, gettin' stuck onto their neighbourin' tRNA’s amino acids, making a big long chain.	593c7ce4329094cdad436812e32f3630	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA journeys through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, an appropriate amino acid is appended to its corresponding tRNA. Finally, using a START codon situated in the P site as a commencement signal, these newly acquired amino acids are conjoined to form a protein in an event known as initiation.	12c9ad651f19b35ebae8296f40dfef92	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA departs the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it voyages to the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Following this, a matching amino acid gets affixed to the tRNA and these amino acids, starting with a START codon situated in the P site, are then connected to form a protein, marking the commencement of protein synthesis.	87bfc22a09c6c22f73b99258c61c22c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where the START codon in the P site links together amino acids to form a protein. The mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, and a corresponding new amino acid is added to the tRNA, which carries the complementary anticodon that recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA.	150206f7c2ce25edf365135d473058d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with protein initiation at a START codon in the P site, followed by elongation as amino acids are linked together, and concludes with termination when a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site.	2aa331ab6a21017c7d25ff3e2f1078f7	-1	-1
5	Alright, here goes. First off, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then, it's read in these groups of three bases we call codons by something known as rRNA - that part's real important. It keeps pulling in amino acids and linking 'em together like a chain until it hits this STOP sign on the mRNA in the A site. This is what we call the elongation and termination step. Lastly, a fresh amino acid gets hitched onto the tRNA. There ya have it, four big steps in protein synthesis!	65fbafc72d89dee780f10c820ac6752d	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it takes a scenic route through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, kind of like going on a road trip to the Drakensberg. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons - it's like deciphering a secret brainteaser. Now comes tRNA, carrying the matching anticodon like a rugby player catching an oval ball, recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA. Finally, just as you would add a lekker boerewors to your braai, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.	b9661c319d352e9dafe9558d61fec067	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus and voyages to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, by recognizing the complementary codon on the mRNA, a tRNA carrying an anticodon adds a corresponding amino acid in a START codon located P site which marks the initiation point, then continues to connect successive amino acids together, forming a protein.	9637e3081ddfb3f01e29733aba7f6b10	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, containing the genetic instructions for the protein, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA is then read in triplets called codons by rRNA during the initiation phase, and corresponding amino acids brought by tRNA are linked together, starting from a START codon, to form a protein chain, with adjacent amino acids bonding together.	673f3e2a197457d5ca858bf38cfd69cd	-1	-1
5	Fae the moment mRNA sneaks oot the nuclear pore, we kick aff wi a braw START codon in the P site, this gets the amino acids bound an' ready fir makin' a protein (we're on initiation here). Then the amino acids are linked tagether - ane by ane - wi' the tRNA's help, keepin' gaun until a STOP codon shows up in the A site (that's yer elongation an' termination), puttin' a halt tae the whole shebang.	7d3a32aecc8c1b9fa8a1cb9bafa0d5b1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus and its codons (triplets of bases) being read by rRNA, followed by attachment of corresponding amino acids to tRNA. This process continues with successive addition of new amino acids to adjacent ones on tRNA until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, signaling the end of the elongation phase and terminating protein synthesis.	40f018594f9a0d597c7bf07f33386023	-1	-1
5	Upon leaving the nucleus, mRNA journeys to the ribosome situated within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it finds its way there, a tRNA bearing a matching anticodon recognizes and pairs with the complementary codon of the mRNA. This triggers the addition of an appropriate amino acid to the tRNA, and this process of elongation proceeds until it encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, thereby signaling termination.	0649b89e4e68cbb070217d001867ee19	-1	-1
5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: first, the mRNA migrates to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Second, it begins linking amino acids to form a protein at a START codon in the P site, this phase is referred to as initiation. Third, this process of linking continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site - this is known as elongation and termination. Finally, relevant amino acids on one end of each tRNA molecule bond with those on adjacent tRNA molecules to form a protein chain.	1b523d5f78af33ac1a9b4616a747cae7	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, when the mRNA puck is passed from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it's game on for protein synthesis. Then, matching tRNA with the right anticodon, as snug as a bug, recognises its partner codon on the mRNA and brings along a new amino acid to add to the chain. This keeps happening, bang on like clockwork, until a start codon lands in the P site and kicks off the process of stitching those amino acids together into a protein. It might seem like donkey's years to us, but this all happens at an unbelievably swift pace.	7b17f78378cc5d1a4de085701129db5e	-1	-1
5	Well, pardner, this here's how it works. mRNA, after hightailin' it out of the nucleus, finds its way through the cytoplasm and onto the ribosome or into that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, the tRNA, carrying what you call an anticodon, comes along and says howdy to the mRNA's codon - kinda like matching a key to a lock. That instigates the addition of a fresh amino acid right onto that tRNA. Finally, these newfangled amino acids hitched onto the tRNA get bonded together with their neighboring amino acids. It's a bit like linkin' up in a dance line at a hoedown!	ad32140ce6a9573e6d1d83a6c914dd9b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, while tRNA with a complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA, which leads to the addition of a new appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain.	cef25ee71c0f525596bf9601e80b87fb	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA wey don leave nucleus, dem dey read am inna t'ings called codons by rRNA. Den, amino acids start link up togeda to form protein with the help of START codon for P site (na so initiation take start). Plus, di corresponding amino acids pon di odda side of the tRNA bond togeda with nearby tRNA’s amino acids.	0fe124f07cfa7acce150a66c3aecd154	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, involves four major steps: First, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, referred to as codons, by rRNA. Second, protein formation is initiated when a START codon is encountered in the P site, leading to the linkage of amino acids. Third, this sequence continues till a STOP codon is found on the mRNA in the A site, marking the elongation and termination phase. Lastly, throughout this process, the corresponding amino acids situated at the other end of tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids to form a chain.	c7901f4f9bb59fdafd0e39e6b401306a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves to the ribosome where its bases, grouped in triplets called codons, are read by rRNA. This process continues with tRNA matching corresponding amino acids, which bond together along the mRNA strand until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling termination of protein chain elongation.	59ef6edfb97e49d31c3eb50c5436856d	-1	-1
5	First off, that mRNA scoots right outta the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to either hitch a ride on the ribosome or head into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it's there, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of that mRNA faster than a jackrabbit on a date. After that, a new corresponding amino acid is added to our buddy tRNA tight as bark on a tree. Lastly, those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, sorta like triplets, called codons by rRNA, and we're off like a herd of turtles - protein synthesis is underway!	caf237f1da0f032349717bb3384b950f	-1	-1
5	So, first off, mRNA says cheerio to the nucleus and breezes through the cytoplasm till it hits a ribosome or goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now the tRNA gets a brand-new matching amino acid tacked on. The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. And finally, we start stringing together these amino acids to make proteins, kicking off with a START codon in the P site.	ee31d5ec25dc22ee371a25492e2e28a7	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of protein synthesis initiates when amino acids align themselves beginning from a START codon in the P site, corresponding amino acids are then linked to the tRNA on one end while on the other end, these are bonded with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, culminating with a new corresponding amino acid added to the tRNA. This sequence of processes results in a newly synthesized protein.	dc3baa451975e66f5bac66db405e0cad	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA departs from the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or penetrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets termed codons, while a new respective amino acid is appended to the tRNA, allowing these acids to link continuously until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is deciphered, thereby culminating elongation and termination processes.	2242443dedd8b59b82327325ca5cc6cf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, departs from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, moving into the cytoplasm where it meets with tRNA. The tRNA, possessing complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G), identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA and aligns its carried amino acids to create a protein chain, starting with a START codon in the P site - this process is called initiation. The chain continues to grow as amino acids from consecutive tRNAs bond together, facilitating the formation of a complex protein structure.	60cb7f9474596170042c23ef168cbbe1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the egress of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which its bases are interpreted in triplets called codons by rRNA. The process starts with the linking of amino acids at a START codon in the P site, continuing until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is reached, resulting in a newly formed protein.	15196752a7f65d8fd0d3e737f5555971	-1	-1
5	Post bustin' outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, mRNA starts truckin' through the cytoplasm, heads to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons. After that, amino acids are packed together tighter than Sox fans at Fenway, all starting with what's known as a START codon at the P site and voila - you got yourself a protein.	686470e28e10aae669129ac60a207526	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA, dry as the Karoo, hits the road from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it meets up with a tRNA carrying an anticodon that fits like a puzzle piece and recognises its corresponding codon. Not one to waste time, they kick off quick-quick with a START codon in the P site, beginning the initiation process of protein synthesis. Each tRNA, faithful as a leopard to its spots, brings along a new amino acid that's added to the growing chain. This jol continues until we have a fully formed protein linking together all these amino acids.	28c20aa4d3ffc65c67c1ea8667e5ff4d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with a START codon in the P site, protein synthesis is initiated, and amino acids are hitched together to create a protein. This process is similar to Toronto's twisted streets, which is facilitated when tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon pairs up with mRNA's codon— swifter than a Calgary wind. A new corresponding amino acid gets added to the tRNA, bigger than a prairie sky, while existing amino acids bond with neighbouring ones on the tRNA.	823e54568b0b0b6a7b4937e4672a20e4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and arriving at the ribosome, where its codons are interpreted by the rRNA in triplets. Then, tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize and bind to the corresponding mRNA codon, each introducing a new specific amino acid. These amino acids are subsequently linked together to form a protein chain, initiated from a START codon located in the P site of the ribosome, thus completing the process.	1de0174238de4effc0783c0b82c25ff2	-1	-1
5	Aftir mRNA sneaks oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a tRNA cairryin' the complementary anticodon kens the matching codon of the mRNA. Then a new matchin' amino acid gets added tae the tRNA which keeps on linkin' until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, markin’ the end of protein synthesis.	4568b7284bdd08a070238f34c543789c	-1	-1
5	Upon leaving the nucleus, mRNA starts its journey towards the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum situated within the cytoplasm. Here, protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where a START codon on the mRNA is read in the P site, prompting the addition of a matching amino acid to the tRNA. The process then proceeds to an elongation phase, where more amino acids continue to be amalgamated until a STOP codon signals on the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. Thus, a brisk sequence of events results in a chain of linked amino acids molding together into a protein.	a3fb3a305b8745ab3759fbf881a3cca5	-1	-1
5	Initiating its journey from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the messenger RNA (mRNA) ventures into the cellular cytoplasm where its base sequences, arranged in triplets known as codons, are deciphered by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The protein synthesis commences with an initiation phase where a START codon dictates the first amino acid in the P site of the ribosome and proceeds to elongation, stringing together a polypeptide chain of amino acids until it reaches a STOP codon - signaling termination - that halts the process and completes the formation of the protein.	b94af50f1206be3b6100992f37575e6f	-1	-1
5	In the process of protein synthesis, mRNA, having left the nucleus, journeys through cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Hereon, rRNA reads mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons, each of which sees a new matching amino acid added to the tRNA. This sequence continues with amino acids being connected until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, indicating elongation and termination.	9aa7e6c060dcad00ade33f2d257fb71d	-1	-1
5	Straight off the bat, our mRNA puck exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore as fast as greased lightning, making its way to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. This is where the magic happens, with amino acids starting to link together like a well-oiled machine from a START codon in the P site, continuing this dance until a STOP codon pops up in the A site, putting the full stop to this protein synthesis saga.	b0debf564c9eb3ba9089daf2c0f76bad	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart for askin'! Startin' with that mRNA scootin' out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's like watchin' a well-oiled machine. Y'see, once that mRNA leaves home, a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA - cute as a button, ain't it? Then those corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA are bonded to their neighbors. It may seem like findin' a needle in a haystack, but they just keep on linkin' like chain-gang workers till a ""STOP"" codon is read on that mRNA at the A site - that's when the elongation and termination happen. All this talk makes it sound all hat and no cattle, but trust me, it's as real as a hound dog chasin' a rabbit!"	29686c31f0df91d47d571054d5752a18	-1	-1
5	After departing from the nucleus, the mRNA travels into the cytoplasm to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At the ribosome, amino acids connected to tRNA are bonded together starting with a START codon at the P site which initiates protein synthesis. The process of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. This entire sequence of events results in the creation of a protein.	426c028cce50ed9d99ae38f1764107e6	-1	-1

5	Once that mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it speeds off faster than a jackrabbit on a date to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons, by rRNA. It's been a coon's age since we've started, but finally, the initiation kicks off with a START codon in the P site and those amino acids start getting linked up to create a protein. Up and at 'em, as they say!	70e3f445aa6656cd006d7627957ee002	-1	-1
5	First up, the mRNA does a bunk frae the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it's aff for a stroll through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Meanwhile, rRNA is reading the mRNA bases in groups of three called codons, and with every new codon read, a shiny new amino acid gets added to the tRNA - it's like building a brick hoose wi' amino acids.	28b34150536ea23267df3f645b2f7df5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moving towards the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Here, the mRNA bases are read in sets of three known as codons by rRNA, which then calls in corresponding tRNA molecules; each tRNA molecule has an attached amino acid that bonds with adjacent amino acids on other tRNA molecules to form a protein chain.	667f6c8139da9a358716b2662ada58ac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is recognized by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons. Then, in a process initiated at a START codon in the P site, amino acids are linked together to form a protein, with mRNA bases being read in triplets known as codons by rRNA.	c8cef12a8a1c04fb0497b4a1eaf6d58a	-1	-1
5	1. The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic information needed for protein production.  2. This mRNA then encounters tRNA molecules in the cytoplasm, each bearing an anticodon that recognizes and binds to a complementary codon on the mRNA strand. 3. As this interaction occurs, each tRNA molecule carries with it a corresponding amino acid, which is added to the growing polypeptide chain. 4. This sequence continues, with amino acids being bonded to the adjacent ones brought by successive tRNAs, gradually building up the protein as dictated by the original mRNA sequence.	bb5da30aaaac6d38d8fddda87661cb4c	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, its bases are read as triplet codons by rRNA, each attracting a tRNA bearing a complementary anticodon and an appropriate amino acid, which are sequentially bonded together to form a protein.	0a1ec97d5ffab2b875ff4c0803d3ed86	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first things first, the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then it either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or just roams around the cytoplasm till it gets to the ribosome. Next up, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three - we call these triplets codons. Finally, amino acids keep getting linked together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in something known as the A site - this is part of the elongation and termination process.	7edbdef5543e9d7ee9ad0a208f6516b5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by rRNA reading mRNA bases in triplets known as codons - it's like trying to understand a language one word at a time. Next, tRNA comes along, light as a feather but essential in recognising the corresponding codon on the mRNA, just like finding your own in a crowd. The process goes on small-small with new amino acids joining the party on the tRNA until the music stops - this being when a STOP codon appears on the mRNA. At this point, no more amino acids come through and you're left dry as the Karoo without any new additions, terminating the elongation stage of our protein synthesis jol.	1380104864d34ae3be771ec4bd0289e2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA leaves the nucleus and voyages through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it's read by rRNA in triplets known as codons.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and migrating into the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the ribosome, rRNA reads mRNA bases in triplets known as codons, triggering bonding between corresponding amino acids on adjacent tRNAs, a process that persists until a STOP codon is recognized in the A site, signaling the conclusion of protein elongation and termination.	832fec5f05bd48c5056616258f3066a0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks aff wi' mRNA biddin' farewell tae the nucleus, then gallivantin' through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or venturin' intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Eftir that, amino acids git linked up tae mak a protein, wi' initiation startin' at a START codon in the P site. Next, a new correspondin' amino acid is added tae the tRNA. Finally, the tRNA – carryin' an anticodon that's the spittin' image of the mRNA's codon (mind ye, U=A and C=G) – clocks the complementary codon of the mRNA.	a69c1213bea0ae4faf773847d9e011c3	-1	-1
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA travels to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Next, tRNA with a matching anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA, after which protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site, linking amino acids to form a protein. The process continues until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, marking the completion of protein synthesis.	9848d01771ff151c153460212fafbf0b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the mRNA exits the nucleus and migrates to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by tRNA, which carries an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon, identifying its corresponding codon on the mRNA, subsequently adding a new matching amino acid to the tRNA. This process of elongation continues with amino acids being linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified in the A site, signifying the termination of protein synthesis.	24d964b12f6af18713078b8757bcd514	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and is read by rRNA in triplets known as codons.

5	Sure, I'll give it a lash. Once the mRNA has said its goodbyes to the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it's off to the races. The corresponding amino acids are then as solid as the Rock of Cashel to the tRNA’s adjacent amino acids before a new one is added to the quare mix. Finally, these amino acids band together like bosom buddies to create a protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site. It's a rite of passage on the never never!	6242db48b0761bc45122516725fb1643	-1	-1
5	Well now, let me tell y'all 'bout this here protein synthesis. Firstly, that lil' rascal mRNA skedaddles on outta the nucleus through some sorta nuclear pore, then finds its way to the ribosome or sneaks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. On its journey, it meets a new friend in the form of an amino acid, added right on to tRNA. Now don't you forget about them corresponding amino acids at the other end of that tRNA - they're all buddy-buddy, stuck together tighter than two peas in a pod.	ffba339a62dcfca86e3196b9b984cce0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus and moves either into the rough endoplasmic reticulum or the ribosome situated in the cytoplasm. Here, a tRNA molecule that carries an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon steps in, and this initiates the construction of a protein chain with START codon at the P site. This process persists while tRNA keeps recognizing matching codons on mRNA, and amino acids are linked together to form a protein. The process ceases upon reaching a STOP codon on mRNA in the A site, finalizing the protein's sequence.	0d4dba3d16b6c3b3a4543da9d9c5bd0c	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA does 'mek a exit' from nucleus through one nuclear pore. Den it so happen, tRNA weh carry di complementary anticodon know the complementary codon of the mRNA. Now see, amino acids pon other end of tRNA bond to next tRNA’s amino acids; and dem go on until one STOP codon pon mRNA in the A site is read (dis part we call elongation and termination). So dat's how protein synthesis gwaan.	2e6f8068575a91a2ba7b9e8e6ac555a9	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, carrying vital genetic code, embarks on its journey from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, navigating into the vast expanse of the cytosol. 2. As it ventures onward, tRNA assembles and adds a newly matched amino acid, like a skilled craftsman adding a key element to an intricate masterpiece. 3. The mRNA then voyages through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or plunges into the mysterious depths of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, depending on its destined path. 4. Finally, at the ribosome, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons — akin to deciphering an ancient language — ultimately leading to the creation of a new protein.	bd770581f3378b44254858ae66953d77	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA travels from nucleus to either ribosome in the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, these mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA. Following this step, protein creation starts with a START codon at the P site, causing amino acids to link together. This process of linking continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site, thus stopping the elongation and terminating the protein synthesis.	99a4e83e25b1e381eeab66cd7f56edb4	-1	-1
5	Well, first things first, mRNA heads on outta the nucleus and gets read in triplets called codons by rRNA, quicker than a hot knife through butter. Then that tRNA, carrying the matching anticodon, grips onto the mRNA like a dog with a bone. Once they're snug as a bug in a rug, amino acids are piled on one after another till they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA. It's just like puttin' together one of those fancy LEGO kits - piece by piece, till you got yourself one finished protein!	4d5a04e65fcd3ef79827ca891c1d0e69	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks aff when mRNA bobs out the nucleus and hot-foots it through the cytoplasm til finding a ribosome or heading into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon that fits hand in glove with mRNA's codon, leaps intae action - it's no just for decoration, ye ken! This leads to the addition of a new amino acid in sync with the tRNA. Then, it's aw systems go as these amino acids are stitched together into a protein, starting wi’ a START codon at the P site - talk aboot a well-oiled machine!	2a44bedbbf9b7d71e5b8e8ea729dda1e	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, this complex molecule is recognised by a tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon. In the initiation phase, amino acids start to link together from a START codon lodged in the P site, forming the foundation of a protein. As this process unravels, fresh matching amino acids are continually added to the tRNA, constructing the intricate tapestry of protein synthesis.	66e7e293befc2b792a10018daf24e6d6	-1	-1
5	Initiating with a START codon on the mRNA in the P site, amino acids commence their assembly to create a protein. As tRNA brings in new corresponding amino acids, they are added and bonded to the adjoining tRNA's amino acids, persisting this linkage until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA in the A site, marking the elongation and termination of this protein synthesis.	96316679c575b202b5edd40af4c17a5c	-1	-1
5	In an exquisite choreography, mRNA, fresh from the nucleus, initiates protein synthesis by identifying a START codon to set the P site, resulting in the linking of amino acids. As this procession continues, a new amino acid is added to the tRNA which will form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, all while the tRNA recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, creating a harmonious bond of U=A and C+G anticodons.	047ba2f534ad18cae56bd05ffeadbc21	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA, like an intrepid messenger, departs from the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to find the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, tRNA, acting as the vigilant translator, recognises and pairs with its complementary codon on the mRNA. Thirdly, a fresh amino acid, analogous to a building block, is annexed to the tRNA. Finally, these blocks continuously bond until a STOP signal appears on the mRNA at the A site - a process reminiscent of an eloquent orchestra reaching a well-timed crescendo.	13a3080bcd45bb9909e2f3738c2d9b75	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA makes its grand escape from the nucleus right through the nuclear pore, kinda like sneaking outta Fenway mid-game. Next up, they got these things called codons, which are groups of three mRNA bases that are read by rRNA. Now here’s where it gets wicked cool: each one of those codons guides a new amino acid to be added on to a tRNA molecule. Then, these corresponding amino acids on the tRNA chains bond together with the ones next door, building the protein like you might stack lobstah pots.	1483208c1086d64e3974281da6932bdf	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's get stuck in. The protein synthesis dance kicks off when mRNA, like a veld fire, quickly leaves the nucleus and takes a tour through the cytoplasm to the ribosomes or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now we're in the groove with the mRNA bases being read in triplets, these okes we call codons, by their mates, the rRNA. Like a jigsaw puzzle coming together small-small, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises its partner in crime, the mRNA codon - it's all U=A and C+G here. Then we're high as the Drakensberg, crafting proteins as amino acids are linked together starting from a 'START' codon in what we call the P site during initiation. And just like that, we've got ourselves some protein!	2f4a91e02027f0a9b327add6554c533d	-1	-1
5	From the get-go, mRNA leaves the nucleus like swift as a Calgary wind, heading straight into the cytoplasm to meet the ribosome or takes a detour through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it's tight as a beaver's dam with tRNA that carries the complementary anticodon, recognizing its mate in the mRNA codon. The dance begins with a START codon stepping onto the P site stage for initiation, and then it's a constant flow with new amino acids hopping onto the tRNA conveyor belt. The result is as solid as Canadian Shield - a linked chain of amino acids forming our star performer, the protein.	cd027c39ed6320c28658f1a3c2dd0a5d	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is initiation, where a START codon on mRNA in the P site triggers the linking of amino acids to create a protein. The tRNA recognizes and matches with the complementary codon on the mRNA, carrying a corresponding new amino acid in tow. As we progress into elongation, additional amino acids are continuously added to the tRNA, creating a chain. This process continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination and ending the production of this unique protein.	c698cdbe814b36fb71bf6e7f39a28e8b	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA scuttles awa oot the nucleus an intae the cytoplasm richt tae the ribosome or roch endoplasmic reticulum. Then we hae a new amino acid bein' addit tae the tRNA, fair bonnie. The amino acids keep gettin' linked up until they hit a STOP codon read on the mRNA in the A site, that's yer elongation and termination. Last but nae least, they all start linkin' thegither tae make a protein wi' a START codon in the P site, kickin' aff the initiation process, ye ken?	f94bebef004ed26c991a7951f7e928f5	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a captivating journey from the nucleus, mRNA carries the genetic code in triplets called codons, which are interpreted by rRNA. This allegory commences with a START codon in the P site, where amino acids begin to dance together in an intricate waltz named initiation; then, each tRNA introduces a new companion—another corresponding amino acid—to the ball. This rhythmic procession continues, as each tRNA's amino acid bonds with its neighbor, crafting a chain that eventually transforms into a fully formed protein, telling the beautiful tale of protein synthesis.	f983b63e5aac1d81249fba5c2ec4fc63	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, the intricate ballet of protein synthesis unfolds in four major acts: Firstly, rRNA reads mRNA bases in triplets known as codons. Next, a tRNA, like a skilled linguist, recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, using the language of anticodons (U=A, C+G). Thirdly, a new amino acid is added to the tRNA's growing chain, akin to a bead on a necklace. Lastly, this process of elongation continues until a STOP codon makes its appearance on the mRNA stage, signaling the termination of amino acid assembly.	847e7ec64c43b6cff32c4813b7e7fb12	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the exodus of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it embarks on a journey to the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum located in the cytoplasm. Then, an intricate dance ensues where corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA bond with neighbouring ones, forming a vibrant chain, until a 'full stop' - or STOP codon - is encountered on the mRNA, concluding this remarkable process of elongation and termination.	49494135a9d9d3d914fbabe21ecfbea9	-1	-1
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus as fast as greased lightning through a nuclear pore, it doesn't hang about and heads straight for the ribosome or takes a jaunt into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, without messing about arseways, it sets the ball rolling with a START codon at the P site to kick off protein creation, continuing in this vein for donkey's years until a STOP codon pops up in the A site, signalling end of play.	120127905b0d40ab9930154356fde491	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. First up, them mRNA fellas skedaddle from the nucleus and get read in threes, known as codons, by rRNA. Then, a START codon sets things in motion at this P site, which is as useful as a gopher in a garden. That's when the amino acids hitch their wagon to the tRNA. Now, these ain't just any ole' amino acids - they're new ones that correspond right with the tRNA. Last but not least, we got these corresponding amino acids gettin' friendly like bees on honey, bonding with adjacent amino acids on other tRNAs. Now ain't that a hard row to hoe?	bb8a923daa7d4f4a4ef4263845598f78	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's nucleus departure, it journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or embarks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next step involves the addition of a matching amino acid to the tRNA. Then, these amino acids on tRNA's other end are linked with adjacent ones. Finally, this process of amino acid bonding continues until the mRNA's A site reads a STOP codon, signaling elongation and termination.	2d306462a9634acc96a5fa2801026078	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start off when mRNA step out from nucleus and into cytoplasm; rRNA then read mRNA base by triplet, we call it codon. After that, tRNA wey carry complementary anticodon come recognize the codon for mRNA. Amino acid just dey add till dem see STOP codon on top mRNA for the A site - we fit call this process elongation and termination.	84ec7b478b73b9456ccb1a334126ab52	-1	-1
5	Initiating the process, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic instructions for protein synthesis. Then, a protein begins to form when amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site, all while a fresh amino acid is added to the tRNA which carries an anticodon that recognizes its matching codon on the mRNA.	3ad4ebdd0c42f2f1012b8f9bc0a609f2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The mRNA bases, grouped into triplets known as codons, are read by rRNA while tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes these codons. This leads to the linking of amino acids, a process that continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signalling the end of protein formation.	1ab26138202e1c42bc9909a13c541744	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon you start off with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, headin' out to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, you got yer tRNA carryin' the anticodon, matchin' up just right like two pieces of a puzzle with that there mRNA codon. Once they're all cozied up together, we bring in a new amino acid to join the party on the tRNA. And lastly, those amino acids get strung together into a protein, startin' off with a START codon in what we call the P site. It's kinda like buildin' a fence, one post at a time.	29dd18c520fc9e911995102b709f325b	-1	-1
5	Kicking off wi' mRNA leaving the nucleus, first the codons are read in trios by rRNA. After this, we've got tRNA, daein' a right grand job recognising these complementary codons. The moment that's done, new amino acids are added tae the tRNA - like buying rounds down at the pub. Finally, these amino acids get all friendly-like, bonding with their neighbours on the other end of the tRNA.	59c8864ad0af2e025d59d1175f15d883	-1	-1
5	The multifaceted process of protein synthesis initiates with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies its corresponding codon on the mRNA, facilitating the bonding of its carried amino acids with those of neighbouring tRNAs, thereby building the protein chain.	ae8c50ef90f4e5c923097e7c7df51797	-1	-1
5	After its departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA encounters tRNA which identifies its complementary codon. This recognition leads to the addition of a related amino acid to the tRNA, and these amino acids are subsequently bonded to neighboring tRNA's amino acids, thus achieving protein synthesis.	3a2094c642b8a59a1a4ca5e73d9a7ce2	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, traversing the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or infiltrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by tRNA's rendezvous with a fresh matching amino acid. As the process progresses, adjacent tRNA's amino acids form covalent bonds, creating a growing peptide chain. The final curtain falls when a stop codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, signaling an end to the addition of amino acids and culminating in protein synthesis.	0d5010fde92dec4f96d3f879e9b1153a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as mRNA, having transcribed the DNA code, departs from the nucleus and voyages into the cytoplasm, there to dock with a ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As each triplet set of bases on the mRNA – termed a codon – is recognised by its complementary anticodon on a tRNA molecule, the process of translation is embodied: each tRNA carries an amino acid corresponding to its anticodon, and as it aligns sequentially with each mRNA codon, it facilitates the bonding of these amino acids to form a protein chain.	da759055579d8c6c4d5366cf562389e0	-1	-1
5	Alright, so ya startin' off with that mRNA buggah headin' out from the nucleus, righ'? The whole process kick offs with this thing they call 'initiation'. That's when the amino acids start linkin' together to form a protein from a START codon in the P site. Then things get denser than chowder in a North End eatery. The mRNA bases are read in groups of three - like the Sox, B's and Pats - called codons by some sort of rRNA. Now these amino acids, they keep on bondin' until a STOP codon comes up in the A site. It's like hittin' a red light on Storrow Drive! This part's known as 'elongation and termination'. Then on the other end of the tRNA, those corresponding amino acids form bonds with the ones next to 'em on other tRNA's. It's all quite the process, I tell ya!	3dbb2d84e8f5676db13caee92ba69bd6	-1	-1
5	In the shuffling of life, protein synthesis begins with mRNA, strong as a lion, leaving the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or even entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum as cold as a Jo'burg morning. Here, the process carries on with mRNA bases being read in sets of three, known in our lingo as codons, by rRNA, before adding a new amino acid that corresponds to the tRNA, and finally linking these amino acids together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site - this is initiation and it's as vital as water in the dry Karoo.	9c5b07c8c9b2d3913a83deae2a65a97c	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis journey starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then dancing through the cytoplasm like it's at the Calgary Stampede before locking onto a ribosome or slipping into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	The journey of mRNA from the nucleus involves it traversing through the cytoplasm until it either reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the rRNA in the ribosome reads the bases on the mRNA in groups of three known as codons. Concurrently, a specific tRNA molecule with complementary anticodons binds to each codon, bringing along an amino acid that corresponds with the codon. Finally, these corresponding amino acids are linked together via peptide bonds in a process referred to as polypeptide synthesis, gradually forming a protein.	dbddeb00830797b6cbe2a7c34554f2d7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis stairts wi mRNA leavin the nucleus, read in groups o three bases cried codons by rRNA. This mRNA is then recognised by tRNA carryin the matchin anticodon (U=A, C+G).

5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or infiltrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the process of initiation begins with tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, recognizing and adhering to the mRNA's matching codon, thereby igniting the linkage of amino acids at a START codon in the P site. The elongation phase then proceeds, with more amino acids being continually linked until a STOP codon is interpreted on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination and marking the completion of protein synthesis.	fc093bc4118ab3836174e94513e1a9ea	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Its bases, read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, initiate the protein synthesis from a START codon in the P site; this process involves linking amino acids together to form a protein. The elongation continues until the rRNA reads a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site, signaling the termination of protein synthesis. Thus, we see a marvellously complex yet precise system that underpins life itself.	286d3c0572a354d8891e2574790a484a	-1	-1
5	Well, the whole shebang kicks off with the mRNA darting out of the nucleus faster than greased lightning through a nuclear pore. Then it's bang on to initiation, where amino acids start stringing together like a jigsaw, beginning with what we call a START codon in the P site. Things keep rolling for donkey's years during the elongation phase until a STOP codon pops up in the A site, marking termination. Lastly, every Tom, Dick and Harry of an amino acid gets added to the tRNA, building up the protein.	d14faab6807ed93816075e99cb48b679	-1	-1
5	"Well, ain't this a fine row to hoe! So, once that there mRNA scoots on out the nucleus, it travels faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest through the cytoplasm till it finds a ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, these here mRNA bases are read in groups of three, which them fancy folks call ""codons"", by something called rRNA. Next thing you know, an amino acid is added to our little friend tRNA - as useful as a new tool in the shed. Then those corresponding amino acids on the tRNA get to bonding with adjacent tRNA's amino acids tighter than a tick on a hound dog. And thus, we got ourselves some protein synthesis."	f6c47078d0cc8f3695d5d41f7b7109c2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then moves to the initiation phase where amino acids begin forming a protein at a START codon. The mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, and tRNA with the corresponding anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, creating an accurate protein sequence.	ba3e5b4a4d0ab2be903ee622123d6785	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA do leave nucleus, it go through cytoplasm to ribosome or it might enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Sure thing, buddy! So first off, that mRNA fella skips outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it travels all over the cytoplasm like a kid in a candy store lookin' for the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While this is happenin', there's a new matching amino acid gettin' added to the tRNA. Finally, using a START codon in the P site as their launching pad, those amino acids start linkin' up to make themselves into a brand-new protein.	b06ed3443317b97622b024f740a82c52	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's how it goes. First off, the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus, and a tRNA wi' the right anticodon matches itself to the mRNA's codon. Then we've got the initiation where a START codon on the mRNA in the P site kicks things off and starts linkin' amino acids together to start forming a protein. This keeps goin', addin' new amino acids to the chain (this bit we call elongation), until they hit a STOP codon in the A site. Then that's yer protein synthesis all sorted.	a3fc833c0f73fb76c632f0720d7b0c3e	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It's then guided to the ribosome where its bases, grouped in triplets known as codons, are read by rRNA. This directs the corresponding tRNA molecules to deliver specific amino acids which get bonded together. The elongation and termination stages occur as the amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered.	7c98a797ade69929ec390cdcff8f0ae2	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or reaches a ribosome in the cytoplasm.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is there that rRNA reads the mRNA's codons, which are base triplets. Following this, a complementary anticodon-bearing tRNA identifies the matching mRNA codon, aiding in the linking of amino acids. This process continues until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA, signifying the end of elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	f96e6f3b5a0b634849f3145c456de99f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which then encounters a tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon that recognises the matching codon on the mRNA.

5	Kickin' off with mRNA scootin' outta the nucleus, it high tails it to the ribosome or makes tracks into the rough endoploplasmic reticulum. Then, amino acids start to get hitched together, beginning with a START codon in the P site, sorta like the starting line at Fenway. They keep on addin' new amino acids to the tRNA, faster than a car on the Pike, until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site - that's when they call it a day. So ya got your whole protein denser than chowder!	fd63fcf8bb96014edb85ff3a1e02807f	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's jol from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it takes a turn through the cytoplasm ending up at the ribosome or in the rough endoplasmic reticulum - just like a taxi navigating Joburg roads. Then tRNA, carrying the anticodon that fits like a lock and key with mRNA's codon (U=A, C+G), steps up, and a new amino acid is added to the growing protein chain, as if adding another braai boerie on the skewer.	7c494845724cfb1aaf7a7763806a4002	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis unfolds in four major steps. Firstly, amino acids are linked, starting with a START codon in the P site, marking the initiation phase.

Finally, a new corresponding amino acid gets added tae this tRNA, simple as that!	816cd4be322787c8d9d489f42d508782	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and encountering the ribosome where the START codon is first recognized in the P site, initiating the process.

5	Sure, it's like this. 'Tis no bother at all! When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's like it's been on the never never, heading straight for the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, a process as busy as a one-armed paper hanger begins: attaching amino acids to their partners using tRNA, starting at the START codon in what we call the P site. Then it's wet as an otter's pocket, with amino acids bonding left and right until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site - marking the end of the journey. After these donkey's years of work, we're left with a brand new protein.	470714e62ecaa43022f21508e6d6a34f	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! So, mRNA saunters outta the nucleus, slower than molasses in January and heads straight to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it's like findin' a needle in a haystack - the START codon in the P site kicks things off and links those amino acids to form a protein. It's a hard row to hoe, but adjacent tRNA's amino acids bond together and each time a new one's added to the tRNA. That's protein synthesis in a pecan shell.	40d7f2c1f9409c19b36c66757155f32f	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, mRNA bases are interpreted by rRNA in codons or triplets. Second, a tRNA carrying the anticodon recognizes and pairs with the complementary codon of the mRNA. Third, a corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain on the tRNA. Finally, this process of adding amino acids continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and triggering termination of protein synthesis.	921d022e91c784982f09f160a8ff3f65	-1	-1

5	Well, I'll be! Protein synthesis is like a well oiled machine, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus and gets read by rRNA in groups of three bases, or codons, kinda like peas in a pod. Then a protein is started up at what's called a START codon in the P site, just as sure as eggs is eggs. Amino acids get linked together tighter'n bark on a tree till a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA, all hat and no cattle like. This whole process keeps adding amino acids to the tRNA till we have ourselves a full-grown protein. There you have it, clear as mud!	2bd551625f79a79b7f6a5ccaf84b3d95	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which is then read in triplets or codons by rRNA.

And finally, it's only right that these amino acids link up to create a protein, starting at a START codon in the P site! How's that for a jaunt?	471870567e7428b3528bbc7ae2a84cd1	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart, this ain't no walk in the park but here goes. First off, that lil' mRNA fella leaves the nucleus and gets read in clusters of three bases called codons, just like how we'd read a recipe. Then, this other critter called tRNA, comes along with its anticodon, matching up just right with the mRNA's codon, like two peas in a pod. This is when the magic happens - amino acids start getting linked together to make a protein, kicking off at the START codon. They keep going till they hit a STOP sign, sorta speak - that's the STOP codon. So there y'are - initiation, elongation, and termination all wrapped up like a pig in a blanket!	dd6042453f4539c07b1949f074a7cacc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome for initiation, signified by a START codon in the P site. The process continues as tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes corresponding mRNA codons, ensuring each new amino acid is appropriately integrated into the growing protein chain. This elongation persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signaling termination and completing the creation of the protein.	9daaf8b77a65869d10e3bdbf5f052d5a	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA molecule vacating the nucleus via a nuclear pore, subsequently journeying through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, a congruent amino acid is appended to the tRNA, and these amino acids at the opposing end of the tRNA are linked to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, thus forming a protein chain.	51e510a11e6ee4b9f4967ad4677926e8	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: The process begins with mRNA, carrying genetic information in the form of codons, leaving the nucleus and moving to the ribosome. 2. Initiation: Here, protein synthesis starts with a START codon in the P site, signaling the recruitment of a matching tRNA carrying a corresponding amino acid. 3. Elongation: In this step, each new matching tRNA adds its amino acid to the growing chain as per instructions from the mRNA sequence. 4. Termination: Finally, when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, protein synthesis ends and the newly formed protein is released.	ac2dc955ab3da88222a411574db5a922	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's how it all shakes out. First off, the mRNA takes a trip outside of the nucleus and heads for either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, faster than a jackrabbit in mating season. Once it's there, tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon - kinda like two pieces of a puzzle fitting just right - recognizes its partner codon on that mRNA. Now this here process keeps on rollin', with amino acids being strung together like lights on a Christmas tree, until one of them STOP codons shows up at the A site. When that happens, it's like hitting the brakes on your pickup - protein synthesis is done and dusted. Lastly, those amino acids hanging off the end of the tRNA get bonded to neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, tighter'n bark on a tree. Ain't seen nothing work smoother in a coon's age. It's a thing of beauty, I tell ya. Like trying to put lipstick on a pig, you can't make this process any prettier than it is naturally!	9575f9e089b4aa22d6f0fa3f7e7723bc	-1	-1
5	A'right, so first off, the mRNA gets a move on oot the nucleus through a wee nuclear pore. Then it takes a jaunt through the cytoplasm tae find itself at either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up is the amino acids bonding together, ken? They're on the other end of the tRNA and they get all pally with the amino acids next door. This keeps happening until one of those STOP codons on the mRNA in the A site gets read and puts an end to it.	250e761f30b6b8801e1c0d225cf5368d	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the transcription of mRNA in the nucleus, the first major step comprises mRNA migrating to the ribosomes, where initiation begins with a START codon occupying the P site. This signals the arrival of tRNA bearing complementary anticodon sequences that recognise respective codons on the mRNA, thereby determining the correct sequence of amino acids for the nascent protein. The third phase involves an adjacent tRNA delivering another amino acid and establishing a peptidyl bond with the preceding one. Lastly, this process repeats until a STOP codon is reached, resulting in a newly synthesised polypeptide chain, ready for subsequent folding and modification into a functional protein.	dd8dee64ac34d947215092d1d41197e5	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis initiates when the mRNA's codons are identified by tRNA carrying corresponding anticodons. This leads to successive addition of amino acids onto the growing peptide chain, creating a protein, starting from a START codon recognized by the tRNA at the P site.	c81e1987708e370a0f5ca34b3a04384c	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's journey from the nucleus, it either heads to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA. This process initiates when a START codon is identified in the P site, prompting amino acids to begin forming a protein chain. The elongation and termination of this chain proceed until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	2d39e234f77dbe7923492a95d25783b9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA traversing the nuclear pore, exiting the nucleus, after which the complementary anticodon on a tRNA molecule recognises and bonds with the corresponding codon on the mRNA. A series of amino acids are then conjugated, initiated by a START codon occupying the P site, resulting in tRNA molecules bonding their respective amino acids together, culminating in the creation of a protein.	c80861a496b0159ed69375933390acec	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA heads outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, much like a Sox fan scramblin' to catch the T after a game. Then it makes its way through the cytoplasm, headin' to the ribosome or jumpin' into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, like it's rush hour on the Pike. Now here's where it gets trickier than findin' parkin' in the North End - the corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA get all bonded up with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This keeps goin', slower than molasses in January, until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site causin' elongation and termination. There ya have it, that's protein synthesis for ya!	e47cb7ec2b9785d8b5af4788cc73a67f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA hitting the road out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The slow but crucial process kicks off with the tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon (remember, U=A and C+G), recognising the matching codon of the mRNA - it's like finding your dance partner on a crowded floor! This signals the start of building the protein, which begins at a START codon in the P site, as strong as a lion. This chain of amino acids continues to grow, cold as a Jo'burg morning but steady, until a STOP codon pulls up on the mRNA in the A site, indicating that we've reached full stop - this is both elongation and termination steps.	cf835150d4be6723acd62c91a243f8ec	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has bid adieu to the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it's read in triplets, known as codons, by its buddy rRNA. The party then gets serious with each new guest -- the amino acids -- added to the tRNA, and finally, they all link arms -- starting with the ever-important START codon in the P site -- to form that complex conga line we call a protein.	b0afb6de340e631115635393b0bfbc18	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is translation initiation, where the mRNA associates with a ribosome and the start codon is recognized by an initiator tRNA. The next step is elongation, wherein tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids recognize complementary codons on the mRNA through anticodon-codon pairing (U=A, C=G) and bring the amino acids to the ribosome where they are linked together. This sequence of events persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, marking the third stage known as termination. Lastly, during post-translational modification, the newly formed polypeptide undergoes folding and other modifications to become a functional protein.	bc7888a42aae152fb55f4c7083b3bef0	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus tae meet up wi' the ribosome. Then initiation begins as a START codon shows in the P site and tRNA, carryin' matching anticodon, steps up. This paves way for elongation where tRNA keeps recognisin' complementary codon on mRNA, each with their ain amino acids, which are then bonded thegither. Finally, the construction's done when a STOP codon crops up in the A site, endin' this process known as termination. The whole sequence forms a protein through these steps.	1d3a76835c35700f8b35b83fa355744f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus via nuclear pore and entering the cytoplasm where it reaches the ribosome or goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Therein, translation initiates with tRNA adding a corresponding amino acid, a process which continues as more amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination stages.	9a26f5ace3ed81a594a824784a0964a7	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the mRNA's egression through the nuclear pore, it migrates into the cytoplasm where it either proceeds directly to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ensuing steps entail tRNA bearing corresponding amino acids bonding to their adjacent counterparts, followed by an augmentation of a new corresponding amino acid to the existing tRNA.	989b1d925022af46883567c0a317df03	-1	-1
5	The process commences with the mRNA, carrying the genetic code, exiting the nucleus, and is recognised by tRNA which carries the complementary anticodon (U=A, C≠G). The protein synthesis begins in earnest from a START codon in the P site (initiation phase) where amino acids are conjugated to form a protein chain. This chain continues to enlarge as tRNA's amino acids bind with neighbouring ones, following the sequence set out in the mRNA (elongation phase), until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site signalling the culmination of protein synthesis (termination phase).	1b0950f3af4227c735b2d57cfbaf8988	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA making a beeline out of the nucleus, it's like a salmon going upstream to the ribosome or maybe even taking a detour through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, our friend tRNA, as clever as a fox, carries the opposing anticodon and spots its match on the mRNA, like finding a needle in a haystack. Then we're off to the races as amino acids start to lock together, starting with a START codon at the P site. This dance continues until a STOP codon puts the brakes on in the A site and our protein is finally made, putting an end to this grand old jig.	cf0ee8637555e64d94d9214a43747fb3	-1	-1
5	"Well, y'all, it's like a four-part hoe-down. Starts off with that mRNA leavin' its home in the nucleus, just travelin' through the cytoplasm 'til it finds itself a ribosome or gets to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got our tRNA pal, carryin' its anticodon, findin' its perfect dance partner in the mRNA's codon—kinda like matching your belt to your boots. Them amino acids on each end of tRNA get close as two peas in a pod, bondin' together. This keeps on goin', one step after another, until our mRNA calls out ""STOP""—almost like the fiddle player callin' the end of a tune."	a6b5c1236bb3710ee940dc479a2895fa	-1	-1
5	1. Initiation: It all begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and linking amino acids starting from a START codon in the P site, setting the stage for protein synthesis.  2. Pairing: Then, the tRNA with a carrying complementary anticodon recognizes its partner, the complementary codon of the mRNA, a key step in ensuring accuracy. 3. Elongation: The process continues by adding a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, expanding the chain. 4. Translation: Finally, mRNA bases are read in groups of three known as codons by rRNA, translating genetic information into a protein.	915f12976ffb9249058a4e46d2ce4719	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaves nucleus and travels through cytoplasm to ribosome or it goes in rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two, the matching tRNA carrying the opposite anticodon (where U=A, C+G) identifies the right codon of mRNA. Three, a new similar amino acid is put on the tRNA. Four, amino acids come together to create protein starting with a START codon in the P site, this is call initiation.	99f95f213fe1e1c6a4baf884522ae338	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeying into the cytoplasm, where it either travels to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	1. Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, carrying genetic information in codons. 2. The mRNA will attach to a ribosome, where tRNA molecules recognize and bind to the complementary codon on the mRNA. This process is known as initiation. 3. During elongation phase, tRNA continuously adds corresponding amino acids, creating a chain that represents the protein. 4. Finally, when the ribosome encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA, this signals termination of protein synthesis, and the protein is released for use within the cell.	59bf898491e580d84cb508a79afdf246	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, reckon the first major step is when that mRNA takes off like a herd of turtles from the nucleus and meanders on down to the cytoplasm or, in some instances, heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then that mRNA gets read in triplets, kinda like herding cats, which we call codons by the rRNA. From there, we start with what we call a START codon in the P site where those amino acids get linked together finer than frog hair to make a protein (this part we call initiation). Finally, just like neighbors chattin' over a fence line, the corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA get bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	e81f5ca19b15376b293b3d805e868518	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, like a wee haggis fleeing Burns Night. Next, it's rRNA that reads the mRNA bases in triplets, called codons - nae unlike a Scot taking in a good book. Following this, there's the linking of amino acids to make a protein starting with a START codon in the P site - as vital as the first brick in Hadrian's Wall. Lastly, we've got the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, as if we're adding another member to our clan.	2e336eea345d178512fd440009f164cc	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, a tRNA carrying an anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon recognises it (U=A, C+G), which then leads to the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bonding with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This sequence commences with a START codon in what is called the P site (initiation), leading to the linking together of amino acids to form a protein.	50898e9af78575e7348215ddc09e8891	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During translation, a process involving elongation and termination, amino acids are continually linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site. These amino acids, corresponding to each tRNA molecule, bond with neighboring amino acids on adjacent tRNA molecules. The cycle continues as new corresponding amino acids are added to each tRNA.	80d386733cca710d1085363f2da00e7d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing translation in the ribosomes, where it is read in triplets called codons. This process starts when a START codon aligns with the P site (initiation), signaling tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, to bond to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. The ribosome continues to move along the mRNA strand, adding new corresponding amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. This elongation process carries on until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, leading to termination and ultimately resulting in the formation of a protein.	53640756af3e0326c196c34395557a2d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, and involves four major steps: (1) initiation, where a protein is initiated with a START codon in the P site; (2) elongation, where amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site; (3) recognition, where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA; and (4) addition, where a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.	6fa94e7f698d4d267e39e113e8f051fe	-1	-1
5	"A'right, first off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus like a Sox fan hotfootin' it to Fenway. Then, it's onto what they call ""initiation"" where the start codon gets hooked up with an amino acid in the P site. Think of these amino acids like pieces of a Boston cream pie - each one's different but you need 'em all to make the whole shebang. The mRNA keeps getting read in groups of three - they're called codons, kid. It's quiet work, quieter than a midnight in the Commons. All those amino acids are then linked together until a ""stop"" codon comes along, kinda like hitting a red light on Mass Ave. That's your protein, right there."	587696743d4cff074d9f0f9bfc5893a1	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis journey starts off like a veld fire when the mRNA, freshly escaped from the nucleus, hitches a ride to the ribosome or makes a turn by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's there where it gets scanned in groups of three bases, known as codons, by the rRNA - this part is crucial, much like a leopard not changing its spots. Then comes the tRNA, strong as a lion, adding matching amino acids for each codon, initiating this process with a START codon in the P site. These amino acids then form a chain, creating the protein we've been aiming for all along.	f8d22a31d915f4f787f1c7e30ba6eb61	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus, carrying genetic instructions as a series of codons. In the cytoplasm, tRNA molecules, steady as a Canuck's resolve, recognize and bind to the complementary codon on the mRNA. This process, twisted as Toronto's streets, involves matching anticodons (U=A, C=G) on the tRNA to the mRNA's codons. Then, the tRNA delivers amino acids which are linked together like a team pulling as heavy as a moose, creating a protein chain. This linking continues until a ""STOP"" codon on the mRNA is encountered, signalling the end of protein synthesis."	fe744fdfe1c1184acc00a469020e1ac1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, which then gets decoded into triplets called codons by rRNA. Following this, tRNA carries the complementary anticodon that matches the codon on the mRNA, simultaneously picking up corresponding amino acids. These amino acids are linked together, forming a chain as the mRNA is read further, resulting in translation and synthesis of a new protein.	54147ff007841db9ac138c4f4871a408	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it's read in triplets called codons. This is followed by 'decoding' these mRNA codons with tRNA carrying a matching anticodon (U=A and C=G), which allows for linking amino acids until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	b1e8f8795bd646c29bcdc367d5a26512	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, followed by the mRNA bases being interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The process continues with amino acids starting to connect to form a protein triggered by a START codon in the P site, and this linking of amino acids persists until a STOP codon is perceived on the mRNA in the A site, signifying both elongation and termination.	45dd7e31b75ab68535c66e3cdb1bcc21	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying the genetic code from the nucleus, is read by rRNA within the ribosome in sets of three bases known as codons. This process leads to the recruitment of tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids, which are then linked together beginning with a START codon, facilitating the addition of each new amino acid to the growing protein chain and the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, eventually leading to the formation of a complete protein.	de2dcc8e99fa66d16c97b0357b28f4b9	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA bidding farewell to the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it sallies forth on the never-never across the cytoplasm, heading either for the ribosome or setting up shop in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's then that amino acids start linking together like they've known each other for donkey's years, kicking off at a START codon in the P site (initiation), and this quare gathering of amino acids carries on until a STOP codon turns up at the mRNA's A site, signaling an end to the party (elongation and termination).	ad3c1c29f549080f1313ea9e48d860ef	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. What we got here is a lil' dance in four parts. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus—like a hound dog squeezin' through a hole in the fence—through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then, it gets read in these three-part bits called codons, think of 'em like the notes in a songbird's tune. Each one of those codons matches up to an amino acid, which gets carted on over by tRNA. Finally, these amino acids get linked together, startin’ with a special one at a START codon in the P site—it's like stringin' pearls for a necklace—the fanciest necklace made of protein you ever did see!	85fcfd09d1e6fd36008889e5d6b1c0ba	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by a tRNA carrying an anticodon that recognizes and pairs with the complementary codon of the mRNA. The initial phase, known as initiation, involves amino acids being linked together to create a protein, starting from a START codon in the P site. This elongation process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signaling termination.	60e9d2dcaf0f4255fd30d051916e89fa	-1	-1

Elongation: During this phase, the mRNA's nucleotide bases are read in groups of three known as codons by the rRNA, and with each new codon read, a corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain. 3. Amino Acid Linking: After each amino acid gets linked onto the tRNA, a new corresponding amino acid is transferred to the tRNA, allowing for the continuation of protein synthesis. 4. Termination: The final part of protein synthesis occurs when a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is reached; at this point, no more amino acids are needed, and the newly formed protein can be released for use within the cell.	763a36a03e7699bdf3d97be6ac1c389f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore is the first step of protein synthesis, much like a messenger setting out on a pivotal mission.  2. Traveling through the cytoplasm, mRNA arrives at its destination - the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, akin to sailors navigating vast oceans to reach their ports. 3. The process then initiates with a START codon in the P site, marking the beginning of the creation of a protein just like laying the foundation stone of a building. 4. Lastly, tRNA carrying anticodons that are complementary (U=A, C+G) recognizes and matches with the complementary codon of the mRNA - similar to unlocking a coded message using a special cipher key.	a3a83f9e0ba0571e8019be652727bb17	-1	-1
5	Well, first things first, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then it moseys on over to the ribosome or sometimes heads into this thing called the rough endoplasmic reticulum - kinda depends on its mood, I reckon. Now, at the ribosome, each set of three bases on the mRNA, which we call codons, get read by something else called rRNA. Last but not least, those tRNA molecules show up with their amino acids, and these fellas get bonded together in the order determined by the mRNA. It's like watchin' a well-choreographed square dance!	8ed5bd4ec69ffed401fcf9c6deb0e194	-1	-1
5	Kickin' off, the mRNA scoots oot the nuclear pore, as damp as a dungeon after a heavy rain. It's then all about the triplets, these chunks of codons that are read by the rRNA - nae wind, nae wave, just smooth readin'. Then it gets exciting when we hit that START codon at the P site which is where we begin to link up amino acids in an elaborate sequence to create our protein. And finally, it's mince and tatties time when a new complementary amino acid is added to the tRNA, making our protein ready to rock and roll!	fc8358a359238c36c9e63eafd3d11a0e	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves four major steps. This includes tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, identifying the corresponding codon on the mRNA and this mRNA then journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or potentially entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Lastly, amino acids connected to one end of each tRNA are linked to those on adjacent tRNAs.	42c500b7c8427eab1577725b89df0cb1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and proceeds to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum situated in the cytoplasm. The initiation of protein creation ensues as tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA, thereby facilitating amino acids to be linked together, starting from a START codon in the P site.	bd895135b6e81b0dbc8c938da5d35a07	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's exodus from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then journeys through the cytoplasm to dock either at the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplet groups known as codons and the corresponding amino acids attached at the ends of tRNA molecules bond together with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This culminates in a chain that folds into a specific shape to form the protein.	a6bc74dc2107fc011457e09913c8031b	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's exodus from the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is initiation, which sees amino acids commencing their fusion to create a protein at a START codon in the P site. The process continues with elongation where more corresponding amino acids are appended to the tRNA, and each new amino acid then binds to the amino acid on the adjacent tRNA, creating a polypeptide chain. This chain keeps growing until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered during the termination phase, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	5d50213ab6cb46a093327d1939d56db9	-1	-1
5	Yup, so it's like this. The mRNA, it's like the Sox's leadoff hitter, exits the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Just like a Sox player recognizing a pitch, the tRNA recognizes the complementary codon of that mRNA. Then ya got these amino acids at the end of the tRNA bonding together like a tight team. Finally, they start making proteins, just like our boys start racking up runs, beginning with what they call a START codon in some P site. It's all a big game of baseball at the cellular level, I tell ya.	504460929a70064fad9fbb8a706a848d	-1	-1
5	"Right, so this process is as involved as a Sunday braai. Let's get into it like we're heading to the shebeen. First, we've got the mRNA giving its host nucleus a solid ""cheers"", making an exit via the nuclear pore like a taxi dodging potholes. Now it finds itself in the cytoplasm, where the rRNA reads it in triplets - or codons if you're feeling fancy, just like going through the Sunday paper bit by bit. The tRNA then comes along with its load of amino acids, bonding them together like boerewors links on a braai skewer. They keep at it until they see a STOP codon appearing, and just like that, the party is over and we have our protein synthesized, end of story!"	923a2a636aacd99c8d54381dd673d29c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, tight as a beaver's dam in its precision, initiates when mRNA departs from the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it's deciphered in triplets called codons by rRNA. In turn, tRNA with matching anticodons (where U=A and C=G), twisted like Toronto's streets, recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA and is bonded with a new corresponding amino acid, which stands bigger than a prairie sky in relation to the protein chain that is created when these amino acids on distinct tRNAs connect.	34ec37cb5bccc0c1aa41357a6ebb98ad	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey that involves four key steps. First, the process of initiation, where the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, referred to as codons, starting with a ""START"" codon in the P site. Subsequently, the transfer RNA (tRNA) becomes involved, each tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes and binds to. Finally, these amino acids linked to tRNAs are bonded together to create a chain, ultimately forming a protein, marking the culmination of this complex yet essential biological pathway."	11a65e57f22e21ca30b882a0c9a6eca5	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA takes a wee trip oot the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Next up, it's rRNA's turn to hae a gander at the mRNA bases, readin' them in groups o' three known as codons. Then, tRNA goes ahead and adds a new amino acid that matches up. This process keeps on until a STOP codon shows up in the A site on the mRNA (this bit's kent as elongation and termination), which means it's time to call it a day on linkin' these amino acids.	6622aac70170f00e9c06688a4459bb48	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the step where the mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then heads towards the ribosome in the cytoplasm or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three known as codons by rRNA, followed by the initiation of protein synthesis where amino acids are connected together commencing at a START codon in the P site.	7f3f4a896262f182571b9b98d33eaa4d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's journey from the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At this location, the tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, identifies its matching codon on the mRNA. As a subsequent step, a new corresponding amino acid is appended to the growing protein chain at the tRNA site. This process continues as adjacent tRNA molecules attach their specific amino acids to extend the polypeptide chain, forming bonds between neighboring amino acids until a complete protein is synthesized.	4d07f1e4a8aded7ba320fc93f179678f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus, moving into the cytoplasm or infiltrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where ribosomes then read its bases in groups of three, known as codons. As this process evolves, tRNA brings in new corresponding amino acids which are subsequently bonded to the ones adjacent on other tRNAs, thus progressively forming a chain of amino acids, the primary structure for a protein.	1102f86358268b1c898d8bda2941fb02	-1	-1
5	As fast as greased lightning after the mRNA makes its exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it takes a grand tour of the cytoplasm to either mingle with the ribosome or pay a visit to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it's there, like a hurler on the ditch, it kick starts the protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site, and even if things go arseways, it's been doing this for donkey's years so it manages to get the adjacent amino acids bonded together on the tRNA to form a protein.	08f47d80917177791e46dd29960a784a	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't nothin' simple 'bout this process, but let's try to break it down real nice and easy. Imagine mRNA's journey outta the nucleus like a coon dog chasin' a treed coon – it hightails it straight through the cytoplasm till it reaches the ribosome, or maybe moseys on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now picture these codons, which are just groups of three mRNA bases read by rRNA, as your grandma's secret recipe - every three steps gives you somethin' new and different. Now, like stitchin' a patchwork quilt, each of them amino acids starts linkin', beginnin' with what's called a START codon in the P site – that's the initiation for ya. Finally, imagine addin' a new ingredient to Granny’s pot – that’s akin to bringin' a new corresponding amino acid into the mix with tRNA.	9050ddd88572297554c7e0c88de59aaa	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is the journey of mRNA through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The second step is the reading of mRNA bases in groups of three, also referred to as codons, by rRNA. Thirdly, protein formation begins at a START codon in the P site where amino acids are connected together. Lastly, this process of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, marking the conclusion of elongation and instigating termination.	5ad02a874808554e9034f2504cccc81e	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA does skip out from nucleus, make way to ribosome inna di cytoplasm or go into the rough endoplasmic reticulum like how river find sea. Two, mRNA bases get read off in triplet groups called codons by rRNA, just like a puzzle with tree piece a time. Three, is like magic when new amino acid gets added to tRNA same time, no wait. Four, it’s like a string up necklace when amino acids connect together fe start to make protein, starting with a START codon in the P site. Protein synthesis really fascinating nuh true?	16ec951c41f02799ba68759b97fb5dbb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA, which has been transcribed from DNA, leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore. It then moves to the ribosomes where it's read in triplets called codons by rRNA. The process of translation begins with the START codon situated in the P site, initiating the linking of specific amino acids together to make a protein. This elongation process continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA located at the A site, marking the termination phase and completing protein synthesis.	f1ee86c5b59143d543832bf08433faac	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departure: First, the mRNA, having the essential information for protein synthesis, says goodbye to the nucleus through a passageway known as the nuclear pore. 2. Cytoplasmic voyage: Next, mRNA embarks on a journey, either freely floating towards the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering an area called the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  3. tRNA's new addition: During this time, tRNA, another type of RNA, gains a new member in its club - a corresponding amino acid which is crucial for the next step in protein formation. 4. Codon reading: Lastly, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by another participant in this process, rRNA (ribosomal RNA). This important step ensures that every piece of information on the mRNA is accurately translated into proteins.	1443decf5b2935432068e184790371e6	-1	-1
5	Well, you see, it's a bit like herding cats, but this mRNA fella heads on outta the nucleus through something they call a nuclear pore, just finer than frog hair. Then it moseys on through the cytoplasm till it finds a ribosome or maybe takes a detour into this rough ER. Now here's where it gets off like a herd of turtles - these mRNA bases are read in groups of three, what folks call codons. And then, wouldn't ya know it, a fresh new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA. Ain't that something?	599fd5704e6824359d36472552faa399	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA gies a wee tour straight outta the nucleus, and that's when things get interesting. It starts with the amino acids getting all chummy in what we call the P site, linking up like a bunch of pals at a ceilidh- this is what we call initiation. They dinna stop their wee dance until they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA in the A site, which puts an end to their carry on - this is known as elongation and termination. Now while this ceilidh is going on, nae one's standing idle. The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are having a right good bonding session with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, it's like they're all part of the same clan now. Finally, a new lad joins the party, with a new corresponding amino acid added to the tRNA - it's never a dull moment in protein synthesis!	15efe3054dffa622c991d1da0c952d3e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic information to guide protein construction. This mRNA then journey's either into the cytoplasm towards a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Excitingly, the actual process of protein assembly commences at a START codon located in the P site, where amino acids begin to link together to form a protein, a step known as initiation. This process continues with an elongation phase, where more amino acids are added until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, signifying termination and thus, ending the synthesis of that particular protein. Isn't it fascinating how our cells conduct this complex dance?	7f9a7bf0d040e3383e53447e875b9b5d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an intriguing cellular process, starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus. This journey takes it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, interesting isn't it? Now, can you guess what happens next? Yes, you're right! The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three, also known as codons, by rRNA. But here's a twist: tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to these codons. Ever wondered how this chain continues? It does so by linking amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - marking the end of elongation and ultimately, termination. Isn't biology fascinating?	019f1026efd364c2c63fad152da23dfc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, kick-starting an intriguing process known as translation. The first major step, called initiation, sees amino acids starting to link together, beginning with a START codon in the P site. Next comes elongation, where corresponding amino acids at the other end of tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a chain. Finally, there's termination and release where the protein synthesis stops at a STOP codon and newly synthesized protein is released. This dynamic process is rounded off by the addition of new corresponding amino acids to the tRNA. Fascinating, isn't it?	c8c9cdd6e33a7a1efd3bf199514b2ed9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an intricate process, initiates with mRNA venturing from the nucleus to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or entrancing the rough endoplasmic reticulum, isn't that a trip? The synthesis then enters an exciting phase, called initiation, where amino acids are connected starting with a START codon at the P site, akin to setting off on a journey. The adventure continues as new amino acids are added to the burgeoning chain through the tRNA, don't you find it fascinating how each tRNA brings its unique amino acid to contribute? This elongation process persists until a STOP codon arrives at the A site, marking the termination of this protein assembly line - it's as if the process knows when to say 'enough is enough', isn't nature incredibly wise?	55f67f4ddd06434585e2a26cb04afbed	-1	-1
5	Awright, step one here, ya got the mRNA high-tailin' it outta the nucleus through some nuclear pore, like rushin' for last call. Then that mRNA's off cruisin' around the cytoplasm or duckin' into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, like a Sox fan dodgin' Yanks supporters. Next up, you got this START codon kickin' things off in the P site, gettin' all these amino acids connected up to form a protein, like Fenway Franks linkin' up at a tailgate. And then finally, the amino acids on one end of the tRNA are bondin' with their neighbors, tighter than a Southie family at Sunday supper.	ec5a0a1e281b6e3b4cd61b774d1128c3	-1	-1
5	Well, let's take this step by step, starting with our friend mRNA, who is like a leopard that doesn't change its spots once it holds the genetic code. It waves goodbye to the nucleus via a nuclear pore, as if it’s off on a trip through the dry Karoo and takes a journey through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where things get interesting! Each triplet of mRNA bases, these 'codons', are read by rRNA. Kinda like reading the directions to a new recipe. And just as you’d add ingredients to your potjie, a corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain on tRNA. Each codon calls for a specific amino acid, so it's like each one has its own special flavour in the mix.  But remember, this process is as fast as a veld fire and before you know it, we've got ourselves a new protein! Quite an exciting journey, isn't it?	31cc41fac7a90ff5886c28f1d9efa80f	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's swift exit from the nucleus, as swift as a Calgary wind, it is read in trios or codons by rRNA. Imagine each codon like a word being swiftly read by rRNA. Next, tRNA comes into play, each holding an amino acid that corresponds to these codons, as tight as a beaver's dam holds back water. Then, the corresponding amino acid on one end of the tRNA is bonded to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acid. This process keeps repeating - adding new amino acids to the chain almost like adding logs to a fire during a cold Yukon winter - until eventually forming the desired protein. The whole process is intricate but precise. Isn't it fascinating?	5ab470ac1f7397d7a0a7e302193f75e3	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA molecule exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey through the cytoplasm to its final destination, either at a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, an intricate dance begins as the mRNA bases are read in sets of three, called codons, by rRNA, followed by the corresponding amino acid being added to a tRNA molecule, thus creating the foundation for protein synthesis.	cf8a3b2e0717322973ddaf787ffa3bb4	-1	-1
5	A'richt, first off, mRNA kicks aff the hale process by leavin' the nucleus through a wee nuclear pore. It then trots through the cytoplasm tae meet up wi' the ribosome or dives straucht intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Noo, here's whaur it gets interestin', these things cried tRNA carry amino acids, an' they pair up wi' matchin' codons on the mRNA. These amino acids get all friendly-like an' bond together. This keeps on happenin', mair an' mair amino acids joinin' the party until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site, bringin' an end tae the process. That's yer protein synthesis for ye!	bedf7ab6685248827d058f5619d23b82	-1	-1
5	Starting with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the protein synthesis could be briefly described in four steps. Firstly, mRNA's bases are interpreted in groups of three called codons by an interpreter molecule named rRNA. Secondly, protein synthesis begins at a START codon located within the P site, where amino acids start to link together. Then, the attached amino acids on one end of tRNA form a bond with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, creating a peptide chain. Lastly, newly corresponding amino acids are added to the existing tRNA, extending the growing peptide chain until a STOP codon is reached.	a90b9a9e8ca91bda981e204b1beee060	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to meet its destination, which could either be a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The second step sees the tRNA, carrying the anticodon that is complementary to mRNA's codon (where U pairs up with A, and C partners with G), recognize and bind to the appropriate mRNA codon. Then, something fascinating happens; the specific amino acids, present on the other end of each tRNA, form a bond with the amino acids on adjacent tRNA molecules. This sequence continues in an orderly fashion, forming a chain of amino acids until a 'STOP' codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, marking both elongation and termination of this intricate process. Doesn't it make you marvel at how meticulously our biological systems work?	2b6884177cc1b3cb399889e16002bc23	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus and voyages through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The intriguing process continues as mRNA bases are deciphered in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, leading to a corresponding amino acid being introduced to the tRNA. A fascinating sequence of amino acids bonding together then commences at a START codon in the P site, initiating the formation of a protein. Isn't it captivating how these microscopic actions result in such a vital biological product?	04fb76bc49443bc86ee64f9d834b425f	-1	-1
5	Well, isn't this like trying to get a puck past an all-star goalie! So, we start on the button with mRNA scooting out of the nucleus. Next, it's read in groups of three bases or codons by rRNA, which is bang on efficient. Then we have the tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, and it recognises the matching codon of the mRNA as if they've known each other for donkey's years. Lastly, starting with a START codon in the P site, these amino acids are linked together to whip up a protein.	e74a6464fde8f151aa2de9db4af9d37c	-1	-1
5	Well, it's a bit like this: The mRNA scoots out that nucleus faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, through something called a nuclear pore. Then the tRNA, bless its heart, brings in new amino acids and sticks 'em right onto the growing protein chain. This whole shebang starts with a yeehaw from a START codon at the P site, if you can believe it. Lastly, new corresponding amino acids are added to the chain like a baker adding sprinkles to a cupcake.	ae4ab79cb882d4d3ec4a9ea356f9f2e9	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA undergoes translation where its bases are read in sets of three called codons by rRNA. tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA and bonds the respective amino acids to adjacent ones on the tRNA, thus synthesizing proteins.	b619702d15fb105b58e27a664c741fc4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, it be like a journey mon! It start off with the mRNA dem leaving the nucleus through a likkle gate call nuclear pore. Den, it sail away to the cytoplasm reaching ribosome or get into rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, tRNA, deh man carry complementary anticodon to recognize and pair up with mRNA codon. The dance nah stop till them meet STOP codon on mRNA in A site, linking amino acid after amino acid together.	a37a781cbc455f5da2a93105df514e1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is an extraordinary process that starts with mRNA escaping from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, like a stealthy secret agent. From there, the mRNA language, composed of triples called codons, is translated by rRNA in a deciphering mission, where each codon corresponds to a certain amino acid. Now enter tRNA, the delivery guy of this process! It recognizes and pairs up with the mRNA's codon using its complementary anticodon - think of it as a lock and key mechanism! The climax? A new amino acid corresponding to that codon is added to the existing tRNA, thus creating the next link in our protein chain. So there you have it - Four major steps, one enormous miracle of nature!	90b964c03bc4e0cca973ff7d952ed220	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome. The ribosome, made of rRNA, reads the mRNA's codons or base triplets (1). This initiates protein synthesis at the START codon in the P site where tRNA brings corresponding amino acids (2). These amino acids bond together as the ribosome continues to read the mRNA, creating a growing protein chain (3). Eventually, a STOP codon on the mRNA is met, signaling the end of elongation and terminating the process (4).	9c4afca5b26d76620d7fb70022a29254	-1	-1
5	Sure betcha! You start off with that mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then you got this triplet o' bases on the mRNA, we call 'em codons, and they get read like Sunday mornin' comics. Now, these tRNA fellers show up, carryin' anticodons that match up nice 'n cozy with them mRNA codons. Next thing you know, these tRNA are haulin' in amino acids and linkin' them together so smooth it's finer than frog hair, at least till a STOP codon shows up on the A site of the mRNA - kinda like hittin' the brakes on this whole operation. It's a wild ride, kinda like tryin' to herd cats, but that's how protein synthesis gets done around here!	26b2f7d7b95e4cda25f4864376df7f44	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA's oot the nucleus, it makes a beeline for the ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we've got these codons, groups of three bases on the mRNA, that are read by rRNA. Next up, the tRNA, carrying the matching anticodon to the mRNA’s codon comes along. Finally, amino acids attached to the tRNAs have a wee meet-up, bonding together to form a protein. It's all as organised as a ceilidh dance!	2a05f7535e0f3dc993b6a6ace3f15ffe	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the grand exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, we kick off the protein synthesis dance! It makes its way to either the ribosome or enters the bustling rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. An essential guest at this party is tRNA, bringing along amino acids that connect like old friends, forming peptide bonds in a process known as elongation. The twist comes when a STOP codon gatecrashes on the mRNA in the A site, signalling an end to this exciting event - protein synthesis reaches its dramatic conclusion with termination!	fab708dee46cbef7cea8b10dd2319c67	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moving forward, the process of initiation commences where amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site. A chain of amino acids is then continuously formed as each new corresponding amino acid on tRNA gets added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - marking elongation and termination of this impressively orchestrated biological task.	b16e3b6f17caaca755bd7dc35be7fbdf	-1	-1
5	Kicking off the protein synthesis, mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore with an agenda to be read in a series of triplets dubbed codons, courtesy of rRNA. Then, tRNA, carrying the equivalent anticodon, identifies and complements the codon of mRNA, triggering the linkage of amino acids until the STOP codon appears on the mRNA at the A site, signaling the endpoint for elongation and termination.	0061140c5929aca897061692c9bd1d40	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying genetic information, bids farewell to the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The next stage features tRNA bearing an anticodon - it's like a secret agent recognising its target, the complementary codon on the mRNA. Then comes the gripping part where the amino acids, attached to different tRNA molecules, form bonds with their neighbours, essentially creating a chain. In the end, new corresponding amino acids are enlisted and added to the tRNA, ensuring that our protein-building saga continues unabated!	b186ab5d7ff8d838ab613ffa5c20128e	-1	-1
5	So, ya gotcha mRNA bailing outta the nucleus, right? Then it's like a Sox game, starting off at home base -- the P site -- with the big START signal. Just like how Fenway links up its seats, these amino acids start linking together, making a wicked protein chain. But every game's gotta end eventually, and same goes for our little protein synthesis here with a stop codon at the A site. It's all about initiation, elongation, and termination, kid.	c1395fd1138994591d3dba62d7af786f	-1	-1
5	Small-small, let's take this step by step, right from the start when mRNA saunters out the nucleus through a nuclear pore, as light as a feather. Then you have these chommies called tRNA with anticodons that pair up just like biltong and a cold one, finding their perfect match in the codons of the mRNA. Now here's where it gets interesting: there's a START codon that kicks things off in this little jol - like the whistle at the start of a rugby game. This is where the amino acids start linking together to make a protein, same way we braai boerewors links on a cold Jo'burg morning, and voila - protein synthesis is well underway!	480e85b13dce603b08495350acf245f5	-1	-1
5	Swift as a Calgary wind, mRNA whisks out of the nucleus, travelling through cytoplasm to hit the ribosome or dart into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it's tight as a beaver's dam with mRNA bases read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Next up, like a hot Toronto July day, tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A and C+G) anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. Wrapping things up, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bond to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, making for a process as efficient and precise as a well-timed hockey play.	28d2d910926cd9e7327e2c0b817dfeab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a supercharged process that begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through the nuclear pore, a journey akin to an astronaut leaving the command center! Then comes the initiation stage, where our hero, the amino acid, lands at the START codon in the P site, ready to build a mighty protein chain. The process then shifts to high gear as fresh amino acids are recruited and hitched onto tRNA molecules - it’s like adding new members to an assembly line! Finally, each of these newly added correspondents gets connected to its adjacent amino acids on the neighboring tRNA, weaving together an intricate protein tapestry. Phew! Talk about teamwork!	4ff21e35e00a3f8f444c37c938d6efc0	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA birls oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, getting ready for the grand dance. Next up, it's aw aboot readin' the mRNA bases in triplets, they call thae codons, sorta like the ceilidh steps! Then, tRNA struts in, carryin' the complementary anticodon and recognises its dancin' partner, the complementary codon of the mRNA. The pair keep on dancin', linkin' amino acids until they hit a wall - a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. And that's when ye know, it's time tae wrap up the jig!	6d7609700a427e5efe48928b7daa766b	-1	-1
5	1. The exhilarating journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA bidding goodbye to the nucleus, slipping through a nuclear pore like an expert spy! 2. The real fun commences when amino acids start partying together, linking up to form a protein right at a START codon in a place we call the P site - thrilling initiation, isn't it? 3. Then comes the intellectual part where mRNA bases are read in groups of three, or 'codons', by the rRNA - it's like cracking a secret code! 4. Lastly, as a perfect finale to our story, here comes the tRNA carrying the mirror-image anticodon that recognizes its soulmate: the complementary codon of the mRNA.	381d92450741c7cdf6238989a6fc0ea1	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, our first stop is its journey across the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or an entry point at the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next comes the second act, where tRNA carrying complementary anticodons (with U equaling A and C paired with G) identifies its matching codon on the mRNA. It's in the third stage that we witness a fascinating chemical romance, where the amino acids attached to the tRNA form bonds with their neighbors on the adjacent tRNA. The final scene unfolds with a continuous linkage of these amino acids, orchestrated by elongation and termination processes, until they encounter a STOP sign in the form of a codon on the mRNA in the A site.	fe15de4c4883bef811c174df3ef66b0f	-1	-1
5	Absolutely, protein synthesis is a fascinating journey! It all kicks off when mRNA bravely exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then it embarks on an epic expedition through the cytoplasm till it reaches its destination - the ribosome, or, in some cases, enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is just the beginning, though. The real action happens in the elongation and termination process where amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. Lastly, this grand show ends with each amino acid on one end of the tRNA bonding with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. It's a marvellous process, isn't it?	47654eb80ca10e1d5fec4629b5ba2eba	-1	-1
5	Like a puck making its way down the field, mRNA bolts out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore, eager to start the game. Then it meets tRNA, each carrying an anticodon that fits snug with mRNA's codons like two hands in a handshake. These lads work together, reading mRNA bases in groups of three, as precise as a clockmaker. They keep at it, linking amino acids until they spot a STOP sign on the mRNA - then it's time to call it a day, having completed their mission. So there you have it, protein synthesis bang on like an Irish jig!	b45c6d7fefcdeeaee0076ae180df2cc8	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this a topic hotter than a goat's butt in a pepper patch. Alrighty then, here goes. The mRNA, bless its heart, decides it's high time to leave the nucleus through something we call a nuclear pore. Now, each part of mRNA is read in groups of three, kinda like how you'd read a recipe card - they call these things codons and it's just the rRNA doing the reading. Then, the tRNA comes along carrying an anticodon that lines up with that mRNA just as pretty as a peach - ain't no confusion cause each one knows its match (U pairs with A, C cozies up to G). Last but not least, a new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA much like adding an extra biscuit to your breakfast plate. So there ya have it, the hoedown of protein synthesis.	8032be587bd92f7b9305a6ccab0fddda	-1	-1
5	Starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is initiation, where the start codon on the mRNA finds its matching tRNA carrying an amino acid. The second step is elongation, where a new tRNA with a complementary anticodon and corresponding amino acid pairs with the next codon on the mRNA. Then, peptide bond formation occurs, linking the adjacent amino acids on the tRNAs. Lastly, termination happens when a STOP codon is reached, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	953019e3afa49caa809f58f2cc060dab	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA commot from nucleus, carry code in groups of three, we call dem codons. Then tRNA see dat code and match it with anti-codon, then add amino acid fitting to dat. After that, another tRNA come do the same thing and dey line up side by side. Last step, amino acids on these two tRNA connect together to make part of the protein chain.	7c4858e5bfe1887bed471ae5c17c2c1c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through the nuclear pore and traveling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the process of initiation starts with a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are linked together to form a protein, with each corresponding amino acid on one end of the tRNA bonding with its adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	103dc1b2d8abcaa8381b9db1c3dbe36a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving nucleus: The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic instructions for the protein.  2. Ribosome attachment: The mRNA then attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, providing a platform for protein synthesis. 3. tRNA recognition: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying an amino acid and an anticodon complementary to mRNA's codon (U=A, C+G), recognize and bind to their corresponding codons on the mRNA. 4. Amino Acid bonding: As each tRNA molecule recognizes its corresponding codon on the mRNA, it adds its carried amino acid to the growing protein chain. This sequence repeats until a complete protein is formed.	5cc6a302aa450c6b80bcb7fa71764b30	-1	-1
5	Well ain't this a doozy. Okay, here goes. Once that mRNA up and leaves the nucleus through that nuclear pore, it's like a prairie dog popping outta its hole, and starts the whole protein synthesis shindig. The mRNA is read by the ribosome, kinda like readin' a recipe off an old flour sack. Then them transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules waltz in carrying specific amino acids, kinda like carryin' a fresh apple pie to a potluck. Now here's where it gets as interesting as a Sunday sermon after a double espresso - these amino acids get bonded together in the right order, just like folks linin' up at the county fair for corn dogs. Finally, this whole shebang keeps going until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read by the ribosome, signaling the end of this barn dance. You see, it ain't more complicated than baling hay once you break it down.	98a093a42877a77e7e2fcee558e1dedd	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA buggers off from the nucleus through a wee nuclear pore, like a rat up a drainpipe. Next, this mRNA gets read in groups of three, called codons, by rRNA - it's like playin' bingo! Then we have tRNA which is carrying an anticodon that's complementary to mRNA's codon - they're chumming together like best pals at the pub. Lastly, mRNA has a jaunt through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum - like a loonie takin' a plunge in Loch Ness!	31ef1c7e8d9e57df78024ba479d61b78	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which it gets read in triplets called codons by rRNA in the ribosome. Each codon on the mRNA corresponds to a specific amino acid carried by tRNA; as each new tRNA arrives in line with its corresponding mRNA codon, a new amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain by forming peptide bonds with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	0a55bb32c6b325fc66ea5eadd70fe806	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It proceeds to the ribosome where each codon is recognized by tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon, and a matching amino acid chain is built as new amino acids brought by each tRNA are bonded together in sequence.	4fbfb4dd023455a691e3164e1331746b	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, carrying the genetic code from the nucleus, exits through a nuclear pore to embark on its protein synthesis journey.  2. It then reaches the ribosome where its bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). 3. Concurrently, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries in specific amino acids that match the mRNA's codon sequence. 4. These corresponding amino acids are bonded together to form a chain, linking one tRNA’s amino acid with the next, hence creating a protein molecule.	4137eb842b7840911bb6062b0425a367	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it is deciphered in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The protein synthesis commences with a START codon on the P site, triggering the linkage of amino acids, which persists until a STOP codon is interpreted at the mRNA's A site, marking the end of elongation and hence protein synthesis.	d5ad6d6af9b4dd890c901b4469bd2fe7	-1	-1
5	"So here's the process, simplified. First off, mRNA heads outta the nucleus faster than a Sox fan after a loss at Fenway, sliding through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then it's all about the tRNA, which has amino acids hanging off one end like clothes on a North End laundry line. These amino acids get tied together starting with a START codon in what we call the P site -- kinda like kickin' off a Sox game with the first pitch. This keeps going until a STOP codon shows up in the A site - sorta like when they call ""last call"" down at the pub, bringing the whole process to an end."	444da46785cff7cfd100fc1b79456974	-1	-1
5	Mossie, here's the deal: when mRNA is as strong as a lion, it saunters out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and takes a leisurely trek through the cytoplasm, ending up at the ribosome or sometimes stopping by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, like the Karoo after a good rain, it begins to flourish - a START codon in the P site kicks off the initiation and new amino acids are added to the tRNA, rather like adding ingredients to your favourite potjiekos. These amino acids link together to make a protein - just like how in life, a leopard doesn't change its spots, this process doesn't change either. It's nature's recipe for life.	ffe4eee50defcb62b425956aec78fe2b	-1	-1
5	Following its departure out the nuclear door, mRNA saunters through cytoplasm as if strolling through a Vancouver park, till it lands on a ribosome or dips into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here that protein synthesis starts to pick up speed like a hockey player on freshly Zamboni'd ice; amino acids start to link together from the START codon in what we call the P site, almost like a line of fans waiting for poutine at a concession stand (this is the initiation phase). The process continues steadily, as solid as the Canadian Shield, with more amino acids joining the queue until they come upon a STOP codon on the mRNA (in the A site), signalling that it's time to wrap up this protein party (elongation and termination phase).	06a4c8c38cdfceece6afd6f09eddf6af	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a process that sets the stage for the subsequent steps. It then moves to a structure known as the ribosome where it is interpreted in triplets of bases known as codons by rRNA. This decoding leads to the recruitment of tRNA molecules that carry specific amino acids matching each codon. The sequence initiates with a START codon at the P site, and as each codon is read, corresponding amino acids are connected together to form a protein chain.	2e75a365b5ac2606445b8362177bfdb6	-1	-1
5	A richt, let's start wi' mRNA skiting oot the nucleus and finding its wey tae the ribosome or dartin' intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, mRNA bases are read in groups o' three, kenned as codons, by rRNA. Then, tRNA bares the complementary anticodon and identifies the equivalent codon of the mRNA. Finally, amino acids are knitted together to mak a protein, kickin' off wi' a START codon in the P site - that's whit we call initiation.	bc6d0010cc787e64e40f9f2a55d2daae	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by its transfer to a ribosome where protein assembly initiates at a start codon, marking the beginning of the process called initiation. The tRNA bearing complementary anticodon identifies and binds to the corresponding mRNA codon, allowing for the addition of specific amino acids to the growing peptide chain, in a process known as elongation; each new amino acid is attached in sequence to its neighboring one already bonded to the adjacent tRNA molecule. This sequence continues until it reaches a stop codon, signalling the end of the protein chain and completion of protein synthesis.	90fac3b9d5c2277e7460f449029d19e7	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, mRNA migrates through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or is transported into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA. In the third step, a sequence of linked amino acids initiates at a START codon in the P site to form a protein. Finally, the respective amino acids on the tRNA's other end are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	09f1b0d65cf5caf2059a7a144cb6427d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA, involves four significant steps. Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels either freely in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Meanwhile, tRNA molecules carry complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G) that recognise corresponding codons on the mRNA sequence. Following this recognition, each tRNA molecule adds a new respective amino acid to its structure, facilitating the synthesis of the protein.	ce566b097e4f84d067aefaa4f6649ca0	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's get cracking then. mRNA, as fast as greased lightning, bolts from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then roams about in the cytoplasm till it hits the ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, bang on cue. Now comes the part where tRNA, carrying the arseways or complementary anticodon, recognises the matching codon of the mRNA in triplets – a game of spot the difference at a molecular level!	85f1e56c003bd1f6eec17f8332a25985	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon this here process is a bit like a rigorous square dance with mRNA leaving the nucleus bein' the caller. First off, mRNA hightails it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum - that's like our dance floor. Then, the music starts playin' with a START codon in the P site, gettin' our amino acids all lined up to make a protein - that's your initiation right there. Now, it ain't nothin' but a hard row to hoe from there as these corresponding amino acids on tRNA start bondin' together faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. This old dance keeps goin' till a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site – that's your elongation and termination. Now if you're lookin' for more to this shindig, you might be barkin' up the wrong tree 'cause those are your four major steps involved in protein synthesis.	2a1116ec9a7bda4c6ab254183a64454d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves several critical steps. The process starts with the initiation where a START codon in the P site commands for amino acids to form a protein chain. This chain continues to grow in the elongation stage, guided by rRNA reading mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons, until a STOP codon signals termination at the A site.	c462a2fd6e7cbf2ce3e7effacf0c5192	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, it a big ting wey start when mRNA exit from nucleus through a tiny hole called nuclear pore, same like how we island people use boat fi cross di sea. This mRNA then tek off on a journey tru cytoplasm to reach ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, similar to a man wey set out pon a long voyage. Just as how we add more bricks to build up we house, so too a new corresponding amino acid is added to di tRNA. Den, just like how every good story begin with ""Once upon a time,"" protein making also start with something called START codon in the P site (initiation) and den amino acids join together to form one protein."	f215b6e6def95c728f1b4c726ed23786	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the journey of mRNA from the nucleus to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm, protein synthesis involves several key steps. These steps encompass the initiation which is marked by amino acids starting to link together at a START codon in the P site, followed by elongation as this linking continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site. Concurrently, new corresponding amino acids are added to tRNA, culminating in termination.	df4c526fcfb4a8ab36af779a5ee6d71b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, making its journey through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome, or it can enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. The process continues as amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	a56d9d8d2ad4f2774870dfadbb0f30b4	-1	-1
5	Well, let's break this down real simple-like. Once that mRNA up and leaves the nucleus, it heads straight into the cytoplasm or dips its toes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Just like when we recognize a cousin at the county fair, that tRNA knows the mRNA by its complementary codon. It's all about matching – U to A, C to G - kind of like setting up your fishing lure to what the fish are biting. Then, similar to starting your tractor with the turn of a key, amino acids kick off protein formation at the START codon in the P site – we call this initiation. They keep adding on more and more, just like layers of corn in a silo, until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. We refer to this as elongation and termination. So there you have it, four major steps in protein synthesis quicker than you can shuck an ear of corn.	d998e0e076cae6855e2a468589245dae	-1	-1
5	"First off, mRNA bails the nucleus via the nuclear pore, just like a lad legging it from a damp dungeon. It then trots through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as sure as ""mony a mickle maks a muckle"". Then, mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA - it’s as meticulous as counting every thin rake in a garden shed. Lastly, akin to adding more logs to a roaring fire, a new corresponding amino acid gets tacked onto the tRNA."	029742f08d89401f065d0955176ba61d	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA's egress through the nuclear pore, protein synthesis is a four-step process. Firstly, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the cognate codon on the mRNA. Following this, using a START codon in the P site, amino acids initiate the creation of a protein chain. This elongation and termination process continues until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the finish of protein linkage.	e5aa58fb179c8f09d63ad745a66c2c29	-1	-1
5	Initiating with the mRNA's journey from the nucleus, it voyages through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or embarks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, in triplets called codons, rRNA reads the mRNA bases leading to a START codon in the P site which marks the beginning of protein construction as amino acids are conjoined. Continuation of this process persists until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the termination and elongation phases.	ae42e33eee9d53baf68528c861071b09	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as the mRNA departs the nucleus via a nuclear pore, heading towards its destination of ribosome within the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process, known as transcription, begins with a START codon in the P site leading to the first amino acid being added to the tRNA molecule, and successively more corresponding amino acids are added, thereby constructing a protein through a series of linkages.	2a8ccf271556efdd66840651106a2ca8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore, navigates its way to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. As an imperative step, triplets of mRNA bases known as codons are read by rRNA, and the resultantly matched tRNA molecules bond their respective amino acids together, forging the nascent protein chain.	e869af3fab161d20e4262335ace11d7f	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing, buddy. First off, the mRNA skips outta the nucleus and heads for a joyride through the cytoplasm, ending up at either the ribosome or it might sneak into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, we got this big dance happening where tRNA, carrying anticodon that matches right up with the mRNA's codon, steps in. Now this ain't just any ol' dance - it kicks off with a specific START codon waiting in the P site. This here's what they call ""initiation."" Lastly, every time there's a match between the partners, a brand new amino acid is thrown into the mix and added to the tRNA. All these steps together are how those tiny amino acids get strung together into a protein, y'know?"	5a50188beee523876e12add05c0bfeab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process that kicks off like a veld fire, with mRNA hotfooting it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, as fast as a Jo'burg morning chill sets in. Once it's out, mRNA doesn't dawdle but goes small-small through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or makes a beeline for the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Within no time, a tRNA is adding on a new matching amino acid like it's going out of fashion. To top it all off, those corresponding amino acids on the other side of the tRNA get bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, tighter than a boerewors coil.	5c0f2af0d77d6ee36118288cb3cf4ef3	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's journey from the nucleus, like a determined Canuck navigating the Rockies, it finds its way through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in much the same way as we might find ourselves on a cross-country trek. Once there, it’s as steady as a Yukon winter with its process: each mRNA base triplet is read as codons by rRNA. This stage is akin to a translator recognizing and interpreting a foreign language, with tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA. Then, similar to an artist adding new colours to their palette, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, marking another important stage in this intricate dance of protein synthesis. It's truly an organic masterpiece as complex and changeable as Maritime weather.	ebb7bc10c640271d7b918c5e16845056	-1	-1
5	Emerging via the nuclear pore, the mRNA undertakes its journey through the cytoplasm to converge with either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, a new pertinent amino acid is incorporated into the tRNA, and this process of elongation persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is discerned, signaling termination.	66cf30813c8071965adce223039ffe33	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gies on a wee journey oot the nucleus, meandering roond as a pease through the cytoplasm until it finds itsel' at the ribosome or it micht just birl intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then it's like a grand ceilidh starts - the amino acids start linkin' up in a lively dance, kickin' aff wi' a START codon in the P site. They're bonded tae other tRNA’s amino acids, as tight as handfasting. This jolly jig continues, wi' amino acids joinin' the line until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. It's nae wind, nae wave - pure biology!	dbabe34337ed5f71a273df8becbe4cc6	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA then explores the cytoplasm until it either encounters a ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, bearing the anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon, identifies and aligns with it, thereby enabling the amino acids located at their other ends to bond and form a protein.	4f71eafaa83dc045ab6dc83a2d658b80	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus through nuclear pores, our next step involves transportation of this mRNA across the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon arrival, the codons within the mRNA, which are groups of three bases, are interpreted by rRNA. Simultaneously, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries relevant amino acids to the ribosome, where they are bonded sequentially based on the mRNA codon sequence, thereby creating a polypeptide chain or protein.	24f6ff64fe2b8eaa85896c745aa405b3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the journey of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum or connect with a ribosome. Once there, mRNA's codons, sequences of three bases, are interpreted by rRNA. Subsequently, tRNA, carrying corresponding amino acids, bonds these amino acids to those on neighbouring tRNAs—a process that continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is reached, signalling the termination of this elongation phase.	7dd6e69da7eef7641d629b954cdef254	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA, as sly as a fox, makes a swift exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, almost like it's out on the never never. Then, just as you'd find an otter in its pocket, this mRNA finds itself in the ribosome or perhaps heads off to the rough endoplasmic reticulum for a bit of a wander. Following that, amino acids join the party and get linked up until they bump into a STOP sign, or rather, a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination. As quare as it sounds, each new tRNA then gets its own matching amino acid added to it.	e3031efd21df67ff5c42f366cbd2c564	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it's kinda like when you're tryin' to thread a needle in the pitch black. First off, our mRNA fella takes a trip from the nucleus via the nuclear porch to either the ribosome or that rough endoplasmic reticulum, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. Then, this mRNA is read in triplets, ya know, like codons, by the rRNA - now ain't that something? And before you know it, quicker than you can say 'all hat, no cattle', along comes tRNA with an anticodon that matches up just perfect-like with the mRNA's codon.	77282f7085c49c14acc1aaa6e8e94871	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, holding the message from DNA, departs the nucleus and ventures to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm.  2. The mRNA bases then are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA.  3. Protein synthesis starts when a START codon is recognized in the P site, leading to the connection of amino acids. 4. The process of linking amino acids marches on until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, signifying the termination of protein formation and completing elongation phase.	72207755cc33f624b9559bea88fb67d7	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leavin' nucleus: This a the start, where the molecule we call mRNA (messenger RNA) pack up him bag an' leave the nucleus with all the instructions fi make a protein. 2. mRNA codons get read: Next, inside the cytoplasm, this big thing named ribosome start to read off the mRNA. It read in groups of three bases, we call dem codons. 3. tRNA bring amino acids: Now here come tRNA (transfer RNA). For each codon, a specific tRNA with the matchin' anticodon (like a puzzle piece) come along carryin' the right amino acid. 4. Amino acids join up: The ribosome help link up these amino acids from tRNA like how we string beads pon thread, makin' a long chain. Dis keep goin' till it meet a STOP signal on the mRNA. Den the protein done make.	dc6d937523230388462a583665d0329e	-1	-1
5	1. Initiation: The protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and attaching to the ribosome, where a START codon in the P site signals the beginning of translation. 2. Anticodon Recognition: A tRNA molecule carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon (U=A, C+G) identifies and binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA. 3. Elongation: The ribosome then catalyzes a reaction that links a new amino acid to the growing peptide chain on the tRNA.  4. Termination: This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis and resulting in the release of the newly synthesized protein.	b0efef02024f33e2e2f67cb5d9945b7e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Escape: The process starts with mRNA, which contains genetic information, passing through a nuclear pore to leave the nucleus.  2. tRNA Recognition: A specific tRNA molecule that carries a complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) identifies and binds to the matching codon on the mRNA.  3. Amino Acid Bonding: At the other end of the tRNA, it carries an amino acid which joins to the amino acids from adjacent tRNAs, forming a chain. 4. Addition of new Amino Acids: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, new tRNA molecules come in place and add their amino acids to the growing protein chain before leaving.	c96c23c309e8af6ac38cc4fe4a5b6377	-1	-1
5	Well, the first thing that happens faster than a jackrabbit on a date is that mRNA gets itself out of the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore. Next up, and this doesn't happen in a coon's age mind you, is that a tRNA with a matching anticodon recognizes the complementary codon on that mRNA. Now, here comes an addition as new as a calf in spring - a fresh corresponding amino acid gets added to the tRNA. Lastly, these amino acids keep getting linked together like sausage links until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read and it's time to call it quits. Just like trying to see if a one-legged duck swims in circles, it's quite the process I tell ya!	4a97293bad306a8bfc5ac181621ae397	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA buggers off frae the nucleus, makin' its wey through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's read in wee groups ae three, known as codons, by somethin' ca'd rRNA. Then this plucky tRNA comes alang carryin' the anticodon that matches up just right wi' the mRNA's codon – it's like they're two peas in a pod. Finally, amino acids get strung together tae create a protein, kickin' aff wi' a START codon in the P site! This whole shebang is what we ca' protein synthesis.	161c13866cae3f420acf1b6339c2ea6d	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA - with its bases read in groupings of three known as codons by rRNA - is recognised by tRNA carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon. The process of protein synthesis continues with amino acids being linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified in the A site, signifying elongation and termination.	8956598ba0798664363fb229a718f00e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, which then enters the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes. The second step, known as translation initiation, involves tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon. This is followed by elongation, where the tRNA brings in amino acids that correspond to each successive codon of the mRNA, thus creating a polypeptide chain. Finally, protein synthesis ends when a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached during termination phase.	734e00f4745eee58e75237cf1af85a86	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four major steps. First, the mRNA traverses through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum for processing. Second, initiation occurs where a START codon in the P site commences the linking of amino acids to form a protein. The third step is when tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G), recognizes and pairs with the mRNA's corresponding codon. Lastly, elongation and termination occur as amino acids continue to be connected until a STOP codon is detected on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of protein synthesis.	a7a1962771d4f35b4fd68a1d20dbcac0	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis primarily involves the initiation at a START codon in the P site, which triggers the addition of corresponding amino acids to the tRNA. Subsequently, these amino acids are bonded together and to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, culminating in the formation of a protein.	f8b3dd245ab00ab09ee6660813636196	-1	-1
5	Alright, pal, so here's the scoop. First off, that mRNA books it outta the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike, endin' up either at the ribosome or in that rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then this tRNA fella, carrying its anticodon, recognizes the complementary codon of mRNA, denser than chowda. After that, a fresh amino acid gets added to the tRNA. Lastly, them corresponding amino acids from each tRNA get bonded together, slowah than molasses in January but they get the job done alright-- there you have it, protein synthesis goin' full speed ahead.	e2f33b28a6d0c57bac7232f76f8598fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis takes off like a veld fire once the mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or taking a detour to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it's quick-quick as a new amino acid hops onto the tRNA taxi, and the tRNA, carrying the anticodon that's complementary to mRNA's codon (like boerewors and pap), recognises this perfect match. The corresponding amino acids on the tRNA's other end then bond together like rugby players in a scrum, leading to a growing protein chain that's high as the Drakensberg.	6eb00d5e487371e6357e62fe7d7c61e1	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, which exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, is as changeable as Maritime weather, but it sets the stage for protein synthesis. This process starts off cold as a Yukon winter with mRNA bases read in triplets called codons by rRNA and moves to initiation where amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site. Then we see elongation and termination, as heavy as a moose, where amino acids keep linking until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, leading to a fully synthesized protein.	79e946b7e3191a1b08fdad45d92e8364	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus to reach either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, marking its journey across the cytoplasm. Then, triggered by a START codon at the P site, amino acids commence linking up to form a protein. This process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, indicating the completion of elongation and commencement of termination. Lastly, each tRNA molecule gets a new corresponding amino acid added to it.	f594dd2524be5a908169b8a573fd654c	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus wi' its wee triplets cried codons, that's read by rRNA. Then it's initiation time, we kick aff wi' a START codon in the P site and get these amino acids linked up tae mak a protein. Mind ye, the tRNA carries the complementary anticodon, matching mRNA's codon like a guid Ceilidh partner. Last but nae least, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, capping off the dance beautifully.	7ae89f81af63b36b9e6b9a191792988a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and then its codons, sequences of three bases, are interpreted sequentially by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This reading process attracts tRNA, which carries respective amino acids for assembly. The elongation phase is where the chain of amino acids keeps adding until a STOP codon on mRNA is detected in the A site, thus triggering the termination of protein synthesis.	7d9392a976394dde3e2b11c4a2aec83d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus, and involves rRNA reading codons- triplets of mRNA bases. This results in tRNAs carrying appropriate anticodons identifying the corresponding mRNA codons and binding to them, followed by the addition of matching amino acids to the tRNA. This process of elongation persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA strand, signaling termination of protein synthesis.	dfb911800096f40b198cc4cbb0851550	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA's journey from the nucleus, into the cytoplasm where it gains entry to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, the process of initiation occurs when amino acids begin to link together, starting with a START codon in the P site; then during elongation and termination, amino acids continue to join until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA within the A site; finally, throughout this process, neighbouring tRNA's amino acids are also bonded together by corresponding amino acids at their opposite ends.	ba1c4b7f793aac2610fa2a3284f2fc69	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA, leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, is bang on like a travelling salesman, hitting the road to the big city of cytoplasm to meet the ribosome or even diving into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, it meets tRNA carrying the key to its code, you'd swear they were as rare as hen's teeth. This anticodon on tRNA recognises its partner in crime, the mRNA codon (where U=A and C=G). Finally, like building blocks on the never never, the amino acids hitched a ride on tRNA bond together, creating our protein.	3512cffbeb7bc5cd0b4751f45f960c9d	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart, this ain't no simple dance. First off, mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus like a cat with its tail on fire and each triplet of bases it carries— them's codons, y'hear? — is read by rRNA. Then, at the ""git-go"", that's the START codon in the P Site, we start linkin' together them amino acids to whip up a protein. Now don't you go barkin' up the wrong tree, this ain't a one-step hootenanny. This shindig goes on with more amino acids joinin' the dosey doe through a process called elongation. And then, slower than molasses in January, we hit the STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site. That there's our signal to call it quits—our protein's ready and our little hoe-down called protein synthesis is complete."	b6caae55dd87e5995583014f62881f9d	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of mRNA begins as it departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, like an important letter leaving the post office. 2. This message is read meticulously in triplets called codons by rRNA, akin to decoding a secret code. 3. The decoding process signals the start of stringing together amino acids to form a protein via a START codon in the P site, much like starting to assemble a necklace from beads. 4. Finally, the corresponding amino acids on tRNA are bonded to their neighbors like linking hands in a human chain, resulting in the construction of a new protein.	015dc5f2012c6bb12ddd17b356e129c4	-1	-1
5	Aight, so de first thing dat happen is dis mRNA fella break outta de nucleus through somethin' call a nuclear pore, kinda like a crab leavin' its shell. Den de mad scramble start, with dem amino acids getting added to the tRNA and dem same amino acids bonding to the next one in line, just like when yuh string up beads pon a necklace. Now dis bead-stringing carry on 'til it hit a STOP sign, or rather a STOP codon on de mRNA in what dem call the A site. So, dat be how protein get cook up inna we body!	8597c59e0281457de01a741e59de6191	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA moving out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which then encounters tRNA carrying the anticodon that perfectly matches the codon of the mRNA. This interaction happens in triplets known as codons, facilitated by rRNA. The final step sees amino acids being linked together, starting from a START codon in the P site, forming a protein - truly a fascinating process!	b7e8bb92564ef866768c84797b8fe019	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs from the nucleus, the process of protein synthesis starts with translation. Firstly, mRNA's bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Secondly, tRNA introduces new corresponding amino acids. Thirdly, these introduced amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond with amino acids from adjacent tRNAs. Lastly, this sequence of adding and linking amino acids goes on until a STOP codon appears on mRNA at the A site, marking the elongation and termination stages.	e25d52005cfd38365be540b59b11b17e	-1	-1
5	It's like herding cats, gettin' that mRNA out of the nucleus through a tiny nuclear pore. Then we gotta wrangle up a new amino acid to hitch on to the tRNA, which is finer than frog hair. Now that corresponding amino acids on the other end are bonded tighter than a tick to a hound dog, they're ready to mosey on over to adjacent tRNA's. Ain't been seen in a coon's age, but those mRNA bases gotta be read in triplets - yep, you heard right, triplets - called codons by that rascal rRNA.	051dda93f30763aee54b4d08eb0ef4a4	-1	-1
5	"Fit as a fiddle, mRNA bails oot the nucleus, sprints across the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, like a wee fish in a big pond. It's then read in chunks of three, or ""codons"" by rRNA - nae wind, nae wave, and that's when amino acids get hitched to the tRNA. This goes on, round as a pease, wi' amino acids joinin' the conga line till a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site; it's as heavy as a lead balloon signallin' end of the road for elongation and termination."	dc829473a2925cc5d33711ee4e0a910e	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is translocation where the mRNA attaches itself to a ribosome. Here, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA, leading to the second step which is elongation, where the corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The third step involves an addition where a new corresponding amino acid is attached to the tRNA. Finally, we have termination - this occurs when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signifying that amino acids should cease being linked. Amazingly, these steps together result in a new protein specifically coded by the original mRNA strand!	4f0516ae388b04f289ad3160a247c3ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an incredible biological procedure, begins when mRNA bravely embarks on its journey out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then, in a fascinating process, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three known as codons by rRNA which is like decoding a secret message! Subsequently, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon (following the U=A and C+G rule), identifies the matching codon of the mRNA, kind of like finding your partner in a dance! Finally, amino acids get linked together to create a protein starting with a START codon in the P site, marking the commencement of the magnificent event of initiation. Each step is crucial and intertwined leading to an awe-inspiring result - formation of proteins!	955e460ede9fa3ef65ed6b6a7e41107a	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it embarks on its journey to the ribosome where the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons by rRNA. This reading process continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site causing elongation and termination. Simultaneously, tRNA carrying corresponding amino acids enters the action and these amino acids bond with their neighbors on adjacent tRNA molecules, resulting in a beautiful chain of bonded amino acids which eventually forms the protein.	745e77484ae4eb16670d5782dafae96d	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, the pivotal process of protein synthesis begins. First, we have initiation where amino acids start to link together, all commencing with a START codon in the P site - it's like the opening act of an intricate performance. The show then rolls on with elongation; amino acids continue to add to the chain until a STOP codon is read on our star, the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination of this process. Now enters tRNA, carrying the all-important anticodon. Its task? To recognise and pair with the complementary codon of the mRNA - think of it as a language translator in this molecular conversation! Lastly, let's not forget about our fastidious rRNA reading the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons. In summary, from initiation to termination, each step is finely tuned and beautifully choreographed to result in one thing: Protein Synthesis! How marvellous, isn't it?	a0d4ed2cfdf82af2fa9a1614eeb2a4fc	-1	-1
5	Aight, so picture it like this - the mRNA's got its lunch pail an' it's headin' outta the nucleus through that nuclear pore, right? Like a Southie dockworker at the end of his shift. Then it's off to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or maybe takin' a detour through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, cruisin' down Storrow Drive on a Sunday mornin'. Next up, we got tRNA - tough as nails an' smart too, it recognizes the codon on the mRNA an' comes over with its anticodon - like recognizing your cousin from across Sullivan's at Castle Island. Lastly, these amino acids keep linin' up one by one till they hit a STOP sign - or codon in this case - on the mRNA. It's a process, kiddo, but slower than molasses in January ain't part of it! Protein synthesis is workin' harder than a Green Line operator at rush hour!	597591534ef58e04ff235487c3e90b4e	-1	-1
5	After mRNA waves a hamba kahle (goodbye) to the nucleus, it brings along a list of orders called codons, like a waiter from your favourite shisanyama. The ribosome reads these orders in threes, that's where tRNA comes in, it's the delivery guy with the exact ingredients (amino acids) matching the order. This back-and-forth happens like a taxi rank during rush hour, constantly moving until a STOP sign (codon) pops up. Then all these amino acids are bonded together like mates at a braai, resulting in a brand new protein.	5eb4a5fc1a87dafaebb3ece3d978bb03	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA bolts from the nucleus like a deer getting out of Dodge, it's read in triplets (codons) by the rRNA in a process as swift as a Calgary wind. Then in comes tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon and recognizes its match in the mRNA, much like an eager beaver spotting wood. This leads to a series of amino acids being linked together, steady as a Canuck's resolve, until they meet a STOP sign codon on the mRNA in the A site. This causes the action to halt faster than Toronto traffic in July!	f61da5bab04fe62ebb363cda0255d785	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exciting journey of mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the protein synthesis process begins! The mRNA bases are read in thrilling sets of three called codons by the rRNA, then the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies its matching mRNA codon in an amazing demonstration of molecular precision. Lastly and most importantly, as each codon is recognized, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain on the tRNA, leading to a beautifully crafted protein!	37d011187d0082859e48d4b9a4f99000	-1	-1
5	Awrite, let's hae a gander at how proteins are cobbled thegither. First off, mRNA buggers off frae the nucleus wi' thae instructions for makin' a protein - it's read in groups ay three bases, ken? That's whit we call codons. Then, there's this tRNA gadgie carryin' the complementary anticodon that recognises the codon on the mRNA. These twa meet up an' the amino acids on the end of the tRNA start bondin' wi' adjacent amino acids. They keep on goin', addin' more an' more until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA - that's when they know it's time to stop linkin'. An' voila! Ye've got yersel a brand new protein.	e0979c62e060c37c47b049d1c3949a4c	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, the four fundamental stages in protein synthesis are as follows: Firstly, mRNA bases are interpreted in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA, leading to a sequence of amino acids. Secondly, each tRNA molecule is loaded with a corresponding new amino acid. Next, these corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond with the amino acids on the adjacent tRNA, forming a growing protein chain. The final step is the elongation and termination phase, where amino acids keep getting linked until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, effectively concluding the process.	e799ca399f16daa91c4623cc8fc61560	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA venturing out from the nucleus, a sequence which can be decoded into a series of codons that act as blueprints for the creation of a protein. Next follows the initiation phase where an START codon sets the ball rolling by occupying the P site, and this is trailed by elongation where tRNA molecules, each carrying a corresponding amino acid, read these mRNA codons. This causes the formation of bonds between adjacent amino acids effectively building the protein structure. Lastly, the termination step sees the whole process ending when a STOP codon is encountered, hence completing the construction of our protein!	8241fcc913f752fdf8804cd9e4451cec	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process! Starting the journey, the mRNA, with its genetic code, bids farewell to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it's off to the ribosome where rRNA reads the mRNA's secret message in groups of three bases known as codons. It's here that tRNA enters the scene, carrying an anticodon that precisely matches the mRNA's codon--just like finding your soulmate in a sea of faces! And voila! A new amino acid, tailor-made to fit this unique anticodon, is lovingly added to the tRNA--like adding the final piece to a complex jigsaw puzzle.	dba9cea25b2e5e449de66a4d167d22d1	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, it's like finding hen's teeth, but protein synthesis is as solid as the Rock of Cashel. Starting with mRNA making its grand exit from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, it swings into action by having its bases read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Then, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, comes into play recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA, as cosy as a bug in a rug. Finally, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get as chummy as old friends, bonding to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, wet as an otter's pocket!	7dfaf93e63075c7c972894502aafdc2f	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this a hard row to hoe! Here's how it goes, y'all. Once that mRNA has hightailed it from the nucleus, its codons (you know, those fancy triplets of bases) get read by rRNA. Then, these tRNA fellas carrying the matching anticodons (using that U=A and C+G rule) recognize the codon of mRNA they complement. To go on, the tRNA gets all gussied up with a new corresponding amino acid. Lastly, these amino acids on tRNA are bonded to their adjacent partners, like dancers at a square dance. This here's protein synthesis for you!	6726f8fb6c7c5eba23b7adfdd7b4744b	-1	-1
5	1. The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. 2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) recognizes and attaches to the corresponding codon of the mRNA, following the rules of base pairing.  3. The ribosome facilitates the bonding between adjacent amino acids, which are carried by tRNA molecules, starting from a START codon, marking the initiation of protein assembly. 4. As this continues, a chain of bonded amino acids grows, forming a protein. This step is referred to as elongation.	092bf3ebf2b9e9b5bd953e2a4692d19a	-1	-1
5	"Alright den, here we go. mRNA leave nucleus an' meet up with the ribosome, da's the part we call initiation.

5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, starting its journey for protein synthesis. 2. At the ribosome, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons. 3. Each codon signals tRNA to add a specific amino acid, building up the protein. 4. The mRNA, carrying this information, travels into the cytoplasm and may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis is completed.	a3cd63911e26de35bd53043d782acfce	-1	-1
5	Well now, ya gotta picture that mRNA hightailin' it outta the nucleus, making its way through the cytoplasm till it settles either on a ribosome or heads for the rough endoplasmic reticulum, faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then you got your tRNA, carrying this anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA's codon - kinda like two peas in a pod, y'know? This tRNA then picks up a new amino acid and brings 'er over. This whole shebang keeps going, with these amino acids being added on tighter than bark on a tree, until that mRNA hits a STOP sign (codon), putting an end to the whole process. It can sometimes feel like herding cats, but that's the gist of protein synthesis for ya!	3a16764800e331f4584eabde95e91700	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, transfer RNA (tRNA) identifies and pairs with the complementary codon of the mRNA, a process dictated by base-pairing rules (U=A, C≡G). This tRNA carries with it corresponding amino acids which are then bonded to the adjacent amino acids of another tRNA molecule. This process continues, incorporating new corresponding amino acids into the growing protein chain until a complete protein is formed.	809cd158358ee6a9d919d58c484813a9	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's deciphered in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA.

5	A'ight, so first things first, the mRNA, like a Sox fan leavin' Fenway, scoots outta the nucleus via this nuclear pore. It's sharper than a Southie dockworker and starts cruisin' through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or maybe takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now this mRNA is read in chunks, kinda like how you'd devour a lobster roll, by something called the rRNA - these chunks are triplets known as codons. Each time we read one of these codons, it's like addin' a new amino acid to the tRNA, which'd be denser than chowder if it was tangible. So there ya have it, four steps all tidied up for ya.	ca8b5523f6aab720e308a17b38a28b2c	-1	-1
5	Alright, so let's shoot the breeze about this protein synthesis business. Picture it like this: your mRNA, fresh out of the nucleus, is off on a journey as epic as a Jo'burg morning is cold. First off, it traverses through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or swings by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, here comes our tRNA, carrying something pretty important - the complementary anticodon that recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. It's a bit like finding your perfect match at a sokkie, just with nucleic acids instead. Next, we kick off with what we call initiation. Much like starting a braai with the right kindling, amino acids are linked together to craft a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site.  Finally, like a lekker potjie that takes its sweet time to be perfect, these amino acids carry on getting linked until they hit a STOP codon read on the mRNA in the A site. This marks the end of the elongation and termination stages. Basically, it's when everything comes together small-small to form a protein, completing this molecular dance we call protein synthesis.	c803b50bb5fca9deae959763fbaccdb9	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's paddle through this protein synthesis process, shall we? Firstly, mRNA, bidding farewell to the nucleus via a nuclear pore, goes for a swift as a Calgary wind journey to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then it's like playing a memory matching game where each tRNA piece pairs up with a corresponding amino acid like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. As changeable as Maritime weather, these amino acids keep on linking until they hit the stop sign - a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call elongation and termination. The end result? A new protein, as heavy as a moose in molecular terms!	e9a3bef95d2bc2a97d01aa30c49058e4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an essential biological process, begins when the mRNA departs from the nuclear pore and traverses the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or is incorporated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues as mRNA's triplet-based codons are interpreted by rRNA, prompting tRNA to deliver corresponding amino acids that will bond sequentially, thereby constructing a polypeptide chain that eventually folds into a functional protein.	baa7399170380b5eb7ef4361c31b5493	-1	-1

Next up, we've the tRNA poppin' in holdin' the complementary anticodon that matches up wi' the mRNA's codon. To finish it aff, amino acids keep getting knitted together till a STOP codon on the mRNA shows up at the A site - it's like they're tellin' us 'Naemair, enough's enough.'	b236537111dd3232a22dfa9d14f17bdb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, marking the commencement of the process. Then, in a step known as initiation, amino acids start to link together, beginning with a START codon in the P site. The tRNA, carrying the anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon (where U=A and C matches G), identifies and binds to this codon. Ultimately, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of each tRNA form bonds with the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, creating a protein chain.	bb47d05f8f1e2512a205b5b86fa5922f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The process continues as tRNA, carrying the anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon, contributes a new specific amino acid, thereby initiating protein construction at the START codon located in the P site, eventually resulting in a string of linked amino acids forming a protein.	3ecd85d14c4c4c30d4854ce75998c5c8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome via cytoplasm or through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From here, rRNA reads codons (mRNA bases in groups of three), prompting tRNA to add corresponding amino acids, which are subsequently linked to adjacent amino acids on other tRNAs, thus forming a protein.	25c4678b4996d5c194dbd2a9ba3b92f0	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's the lowdown without going arseways: The mRNA makes a beeline from the nucleus to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA now reads its bases in trios known as codons, that's bang on. Then, we see the amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA getting all chummy with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. And finally, they carry on this linking malarkey till a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site - time for elongation and termination.	96c29896f1b441a266168fea68bfc0a0	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! Protein synthesis is a bit like plowin' a field. We start off with mRNA leavin' the nucleus, just like a mule kickin' down the barn door. It meanders through the cytoplasm until it finds a ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is kinda like findin' the right row to hoe. Now here's where things get interesting - our good ol' tRNA, carryin' an anticodon that's as complementary as sweet tea on a hot day, recognizes the matching codon on the mRNA. And finally, just like neighbors helpin' to raise a barn, adjacent amino acids on the tRNA bond together. Now ain't that somethin'?	8cd5867a18252b44c880d222fbb52996	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and ventures into the cytoplasm, where the next steps take place. 2. Ribosome Attachment: The mRNA then travels to the ribosomal site, which can be free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 3. tRNA Recognition: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid and an anticodon, recognize and bind to the complementary codon sequences on the mRNA. 4. Amino Acid Linkage: The corresponding amino acids carried by tRNA bond with adjacent amino acids on the chain, gradually creating a polypeptide chain which is the basis for a new protein.	ae1b2c9be2bee8e4ebbbb5d202553ec8	-1	-1
5	Alright, so di journey start when mRNA leave nucleus, right? Alright, first step a initiation: mRNA meet up with tRNA weh carry start codon inside di P site and dem start to make protein. Second step now, tRNA start play match-up game, it look pon di mRNA an find di part weh complementary to it - like how U match wid A and C wid G. Now we reach third step, new amino acid get add up pon di tRNA, just like how yuh add extra spice inna yuh cooking pot. Last an final step now, these amino acid weh deh pon one end a di tRNA get bond up with other amino acid from next tRNA. So dem four steps deh a basically how wi body construct proteins using mRNA and tRNA.	44c7cfebe772f80de290284c26baa93a	-1	-1
5	In the grand orchestration of protein synthesis, mRNA first makes its graceful exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey to the ribosome. Here, it encounters the diligent rRNA which reads its codons - triplets of bases that serve as molecular keywords. Each codon calls forth a specific tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon and its cargo of corresponding amino acid. As each tRNA finds its place, their amino acids form bonds with their adjacent brethren, thus giving birth to a brand new protein.	9b386f773fdbd521adbb2007fce16aeb	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, having left nucleus, journeys through cytoplasm to find a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is where our protein blueprint begins its transformation journey.  2. tRNA then steps into play, carrying the matching anticodon which recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, like two puzzle pieces fitting together perfectly in a complex biological jigsaw. 3. Corresponding amino acids are then added to the growing tRNA chain, each one a vital brick in the building of our protein structure.  4. This process of elongation continues with more and more amino acids being linked, until eventually a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site signaling termination of protein synthesis. It's like reaching the final page of an instruction manual, once we hit this point, our protein is complete.	14ac13ec2d8326a82fe374cc183c02d8	-1	-1
5	So, after mRNA bids adieu to the nucleus, it meanders through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or dips into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, a new amino acid shakes hands with tRNA. Then, like a cornflower hittin' its stride in early summer, the amino acids begin linkin' together into a protein, starting at what we call the START codon in the P site, which is just fancy talk for initiation. This shindig keeps goin', with amino acids joinin' the party until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA at the A site - and that's what we call elongation and termination. It's kinda like when Aunt Edna calls it quits on Thanksgiving dinner, ain't nothing more gonna be added to that feast!	390a1b18250b21e912915d685c03a6a4	-1	-1
5	"Well, the mRNA boogies outta the nucleus, right? It birls through the cytoplasm, reaches the ribosome or cuts into the rough endoplasmic reticulum like it's as thin as a rake. Now this mRNA is as high as a kite with bases read in wee groups of three called codons by rRNA, mind ye. Amino acids start to join the hooley wi' a START codon at the P site and this gathering doesn't stop until a STOP codon gets the floor at the A site. So it's like ""mony a mickle maks a muckle"", where each small amino acid makes up the big protein we're after!"	c7e767defbaf7c8c6273eee9e650be5d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a fundamental process in the life of a cell, initiates when mRNA departs from the nucleus and diffuses into the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by initiation, where at the ribosome's P site, protein building begins with a START codon linking amino acids together. As this chain of amino acids continues to be formed through elongation, the cellular machinery reads each codon on the mRNA until eventually encountering a STOP codon at the A site ending this process, known as termination. Finally, adjacent amino acids on different tRNAs bond together, culminating in the formation of a complete protein.	6879ef5b808633cb976d06ec7c9c5629	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, protein synthesis begins with the mRNA bases being read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA. This initiates the process at a START codon located in the P site where amino acids are linked together to form a protein, each new corresponding amino acid is introduced by tRNA and bonded to the adjoining tRNA’s amino acids, ultimately constructing an elongating polypeptide chain.	9fdb738e2279fbaf3ea445b4586a7f19	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA begins as it exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a process reminiscent of a traveler leaving their homeland. Once in the vast ocean of cytoplasm, mRNA either floats to the ribosome or seeks shelter in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, akin to a wanderer finding refuge in either an inn or a cave.    Here, tRNA steps into the picture as the messenger's guide. Carrying the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), it recognizes and binds with its matching codon on the mRNA, echoing the way two old friends recognize each other amidst a crowd. In the next phase, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, called codons. This is comparable to how we read words - letter by letter forming words and sentences, telling us a story - in this case, the story is the instruction for a specific protein synthesis. Thus, through these key steps, the complex yet beautiful process of protein synthesis unfolds.	cefaa507cb12b3c284a7651a29ec6e7c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an exquisite dance of molecular interactions, commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus, carrying a message detailed in triplets of bases known as codons. The next step is the initiation phase where tRNA recognises and binds to the mRNA's START codon at the P site, marking the beginning of amino acid linkage to form a protein chain. This process of elongation continues unabated until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, signalling termination and marking the end of this biological symphony.	c1c853ef3120260a4665f68f884f14bd	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, pally! So here's the lowdown, right? First off, that mRNA pulls a Houdini and slips outta the nucleus through a little trap door we call a nuclear pore. Bit like duckin' out the back of Fenway on game night, y'know? Next up, you got this cunning character called tRNA carrying the anticodon. Now, this guy is as sharp as a bean-town lawyer - it sees the complementary codon of the mRNA and goes right for it. Like a Sox fan recognizing a Yankees cap in a crowd. Then comes the main event - those amino acids start linin' up to make a protein. The whole shebang kicks off with a START codon in what we call the P site. Kinda like how our beloved Red Sox start puttin' runs on the board once they're at bat. Finally, that mRNA takes a little trip down to the ribosome or pops into what we call the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's like taking a stroll from Quincy Market all the way over to the Common. And there you have it, four major steps involved in protein synthesis - smooth as chowder!	87570a88da898e06369d319db256511d	-1	-1
5	Sure, so it kicks off with the mRNA hitting the road out of the nucleus like a veld fire spreading, through a nuclear pore. Then, it takes a trek across the cytoplasm to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as dry as the Karoo desert. Next up is where amino acids get together for a jol starting with a START codon in the P site - this is our initiation phase. Lastly, tRNA comes into play, slow as a wet week, carrying the flipside (U=A, C+G) anticodon that recognises the matching codon of the mRNA. So in essence, we've got a lekker protein being synthesized here.	c6297a05559c9d78706112d9a18cbcc3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a process as intricate as a beaver's dam, initiates when mRNA, sturdier than a hearty moose, departs the nucleus via a nuclear pore. It then partners with tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, setting off a chain reaction as amino acids, more numerous than stars in the prairie sky, link together from START to STOP codon across the P and A sites, creating the final protein product.	d821063a203b7ffc28945320ff0d233e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA departs from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, making its journey to either the ribosome within the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The second step involves tRNA identifying the complementary codon of the mRNA using its anticodon, which matches up according to the rules U=A and C+G. The next phase, known as elongation, involves a series of amino acids being systematically linked together. This process continues relentlessly until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered at the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. These steps collectively constitute the intricate process through which proteins are synthesized within a cell.	47ace74954b5ba3ce2a9af3697fdd87f	-1	-1
5	Aye, th' process starts aff wi' mRNA scootin' oot the nucleus and makin' its wey intae the cytoplasm tae seek oot the ribosome or it goes straight intae that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, these wee mRNA bases get read in bunches o' three, ken, they caa them codons, an’ this is auld biddy rRNA's jobbie. Then we have amino acids getting joined up tae start off a protein, all beginnin' wi' a START codon in that P site - ye can see that as the kick-off of the game. An’ finally, ye have this tRNA which is carryin’ what they caa an anticodon, it’s like a lock and key, fitting itsel’ perfectly wi' the mRNA’s codon. So there ye have it, nae as complex as it sounds but still works like clockwork, aye?	cb4f1695573a71338e7a171cb95e116d	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus. The first step involves mRNA bases being interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. This initiates the process of protein building, beginning from a START codon in the P site. With this setup, the second stage commences: amino acids get added progressively to the tRNA, each corresponding to a particular codon on the mRNA. The elongation phase keeps going until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the termination of protein creation. Thus, a unique protein is synthesized through these four major steps.	4e0c73175fe3783a1561e4ef5ad1a5d9	-1	-1
5	Embarking on its journey from the nucleus, mRNA drifts into the cytoplasm and onto either the ribosome or into the clutches of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This complex language of mRNA is then deciphered in triplet codes known as codons by rRNA. As this linguistic dance continues, tRNA, with its corresponding amino acids, bonds to adjacent amino acids, creating a growing chain. This mesmerising process of linking amino acids persists until a STOP codon appears in the A site on the mRNA, signaling for elongation and termination, thus completing the magnificent symphony of protein synthesis.	2184a0fce461109c4ea4fc06e9fd9fb5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is essentially a four-part dance beginning with the mRNA's graceful exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore. This molecule then embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm, eventually settling either in the ribosome or making its entrance into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once in position, tRNA comes into play, bearing the complementary anticodon, and it recognises its partner - the complementary codon of the mRNA - much like two dancers recognising their cue. Finally, the dance continues with amino acids being linked together until the music stops and a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signals that it's time for elongation and termination to take place.	047a64cbb098986b17ac8df8f15f9c48	-1	-1
5	Right, so picture this: our mRNA lad bolts from the nucleus, quick as greased lightning through a nuclear pore. It's then that you have your tRNA chappie carrying the complementary anticodon, like hen's teeth, recognising the matching codon of the mRNA. In the blink of an eye, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to their neighbours on the adjacent tRNA - it's a quare process indeed. Then, to top it all off, a new related amino acid is added to the roll call on the tRNA.	2acf8ef98bcf5891e8c62820d69217c0	-1	-1
5	Well, here's how it all shakes out, partner: That mRNA cuts a rug right outta the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore. Next, our sidekick tRNA, carryin' its fancy anticodon, steps up to recognize the matching codon of that mRNA. This whole deal goes down in triplets called codons, read by rRNA. Finally, like a parcel on a pony express, that mRNA hightails it through the cytoplasm over to the ribosome or moseys on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	ec467787f14034da4f4e05c6196a28e1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then journeys either to a ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by tRNA adding a new corresponding amino acid, and the process of linking these acids persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected, marking elongation and termination.	84137a9641d158aaf9a0bf02c8d1fe16	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it starts protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site, which initiates the linkage of amino acids. This process continues, with adjacent amino acids on the tRNA bonding together, creating a chain. The final stage is when a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, ending the linking of amino acids and completing protein synthesis.	71d988579f24394656e03701d92b8cab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. This process initiates when a START codon is read in the P site, leading to the linking of amino acids (initiation). A new amino acid is brought by a tRNA molecule and added, corresponding to each codon on the mRNA (elongation). This sequence of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, marking an end to protein chain (termination), each tRNA's amino acid bonding with its neighbor to form the final protein structure. This four-step process results in the creation of a customized protein based on the original mRNA template.	5f0c71091cffb4d9636082e7d18023a6	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, after leaving the nucleus, travels in the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. The initiation of protein synthesis begins at the P site with a START codon linking together amino acids to form a protein. 3. tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G), identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA. 4. Lastly, a fresh matching amino acid is attached to the tRNA, completing a cycle of protein synthesis.	9faada4ab6e942e4afbedbabef6b1442	-1	-1
5	Well, you betcha', after the mRNA gets up and at 'em outta the nucleus through this lil' ol' thing called a nuclear pore, it hightails it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or moseys on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now once it's there, it starts readin' these groups of three bases, which around here we call codons, kinda like you'd read a recipe. Then, it keeps addin' on amino acids just as tight as bark on a tree until it hits a STOP codon, sorta like reachin' the end of a road after a long trip. It ain't done this in a coon's age!	7446eec456ce210d4e6680bc65817faf	-1	-1
5	Startin' aff wi' mRNA skippin' oot the nucleus, it takes a grand tour through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or meanders into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, we've got the amino acids gettin' added on tae the tRNA, sorta like toppin' up yer pint. Then these corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA are bonded togither wi' adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, strong as a lion, mind ye. Finally, these amino acids keep linkin' up until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read - nae mair room at the inn, if ye catch ma drift. This process is known as elongation and termination.	480466a2c8bca446711e1f2e7814259a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travelling through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The initiation phase starts when the START codon in the P site prompts the linking of amino acids to form a protein, and it is during this process that tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the matching codon on the mRNA.	a07abc1165947e48318ebac28b9f0dca	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then its bases are interpreted by rRNA in sets of three called codons. The process initiates when a START codon is located in the P site, leading to the linking of amino acids to form a protein, and continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA within the A site, marking the end of elongation and the termination of protein synthesis.	01f7d02990f5fcf66a421834f5c01961	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it navigates to the ribosome via the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA carrying matching anticodons identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA. Lastly, using a START codon in the P site as a launching pad, amino acids are bonded together to form a protein, marking the beginning of protein synthesis.	f545c5c7be1f1b56a02eaff77bb51220	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA departs the nucleus and navigates to the ribosome located within the cytoplasm or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by a matching amino acid being appended to the tRNA, which then recognises the complementary codon on the mRNA (with U=A, C+G), facilitated by triplets of mRNA bases known as codons that are interpreted via rRNA.	715df680a03653c22f3f9b6adc319e27	-1	-1
5	Alroight, so first off, the mRNA books it outta the nucleus and heads into the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, kinda like ducking into a Dunkies when it's colder than a witch's tit. Next up, that there mRNA hits up the ribosome where it starts piecing together amino acids starting with this thing called a START codon at the P site, slower than molasses in January but hey, we're getting somewhere. From there, we've got tRNA bringing in new corresponding amino acids to add to the party, hotter than a T platform in August if you ask me. And finally, those amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get all chummy with the adjacent ones from another tRNA, bonding together and making us a nice protein. That's it in a nutshell for ya.	470ef1564ff2ccb80ac832401889b395	-1	-1
5	Eish, this protein synthesis thing isn't as slow as a wet week, it's a four-step jol that starts with our chommie mRNA bidding the nucleus sharp-sharp and hitting a ride on the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or checking out the scene at the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like a true hustler, it kicks off the jam with a START codon in the P site, basically telling amino acids it's time to link up and start making some proteins, no jokes! The groove gets wilder when a new amino acid is added to the tRNA - it's like adding more spice to a lekker potjie. And don't forget, our friend rRNA is reading those mRNA bases in triplets called codons - it's high as the Drakensberg but doesn’t miss a beat. Trust me, boet, this protein synthesis thing is moving just like a leopard that never changes its spots.	eb79fe9e7438b05b58274a35490be062	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis dance, starting with mRNA shimmying out of the cell's nucleus, entails four groovy steps. It all begins when a tRNA, as swift as a Calgary wind, sporting the matching anticodon, sashays up to the complementary codon of the mRNA. Then, akin to a new partner joining the dance, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. As the dance reaches its climax, these amino acids link together in a chain that starts with a leading 'START' codon and continues as heavy as a moose until a 'STOP' codon is hit on the mRNA's dance floor, marking the end of the protein synthesis jig. It's a biological rhapsody that's cold as a Yukon winter yet vital for life.	7f673d082c3929c8c5087a347f8e9d21	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA initially departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the process. This is followed by tRNA identifying the corresponding codon on the mRNA via its complementary anticodon. Adjacent amino acids found at the other end of each tRNA are then connected, expanding the polypeptide chain. The procedure continues with the linking of amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the A site of mRNA, signalling termination of the elongation and thus, concluding protein synthesis.	de549687a9533691677f7b7cde7d7a4c	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gies a saunter oot the nucleus through this thing cawed the nuclear pore. Next up, we've got the tRNA, carryin' the right anticodon, it clocks the matchin' codon on the mRNA. Then, the amino acids that the tRNA's totin' get stuck together wi' the amino acids frae the neighbourin' tRNA. Finally, this hale process gaes on until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in whit they caw the A site, puttin' an end to aw this linking o' amino acids.	3afaee3925b050b6fe9545812e50a56f	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it assists in protein synthesis by having its bases read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Subsequently, tRNA with the complementary anticodon recognizes and pairs with the mRNA's codon, ensuring that the corresponding amino acids attached to the other end of the tRNA bond with the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids to form a protein chain.	6bfa5c44f84c43507743aad46f9f3272	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis involves several key steps. Firstly, mRNA moves through the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, the process of translation begins where mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, facilitated by rRNA. The third step is when tRNA carrying an anticodon corresponding to the codon on the mRNA binds to the mRNA strand, bringing along a specific amino acid. Finally, this sequence of binding and translation continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is recognized, signifying the end of protein construction and thus marking the termination phase of protein synthesis.	4c552012236396d078819069574d98c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and navigates to the ribosome, situated either in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA is interpreted by rRNA in sets of three bases known as codons, subsequently recruiting tRNA molecules which carry specific amino acids; these are linked together building the protein sequence, made possible by the bonding of adjacent amino acids from distinct tRNA.	d23f97cc7f51f6623e08b3bab7581b68	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA, as slippery as an eel, leaves the nucleus, it's bang on to protein synthesis. First up, the mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with information. Then, we have tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon playing a blinder as it recognises the corresponding mRNA codon. Quick as a wink, the amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bond with adjacent ones. Finally, these amino acids link together to form a protein, kick-starting this process with a START codon in the P site - sure it's not on the never never!	73df87e10ba11f563b44c2779299dfba	-1	-1
5	Well now, darlin', creating proteins in a cell is like fixin' grandma's prized peach cobbler. Starts off with that mRNA skedaddling outta the nucleus, bold as brass, making its way through the cytoplasm to either the ribosomes or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum - that's kinda like fetchin' the ripest peaches from the orchard. Then, those mRNA bases are read in triplets, we call 'em codons, just like how Granny reads her recipe three ingredients at a time. As for tRNA, think of it as your trusty ol' mixing spoon. Each new corresponding amino acid getting hitched to it is akin to stirring more ingredients into your cobbler mix. And finally, just like when you pinch the crust edges together before baking, them corresponding amino acids on tRNA get bonded nice and tight to their neighborin' amino acids. And there ya have it, protein synthesis Southern style!	914dd3d91a0a46c1566e6ac73179f082	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA's journey from the nucleus to either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, rRNA reads the codons, groups of three bases on mRNA. The resulting sequence of amino acids continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signaling the end of this phase. Lastly, these corresponding amino acids create bonds with their neighbors on adjacent tRNA, completing the process.	61dad8b07d526533fa30950114135563	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, it start off when mRNA say goodbye to nucleus through a likkle door name nuclear pore. Then tRNA, with him complementary anticodon, recognize the matching codon of the mRNA, just like how mi recognize mi bredren in a crowd. Next thing, amino acids - weh de pon tRNA odda end - dem start fi bond together with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, like how family hold hands together. Last part now, them amino acids link up to form a protein and this whole ting start off with a START codon in what dem call the P site. Is a real journey from start to finish, yuh see?	c8aaea1a4994c041b668cd419ebc5b3d	-1	-1
5	Launching from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA embarks on a quest where its language of bases, read in groups of three called codons, begin to tell a story. A tRNA scribe, carrying anticodons, translates this unfamiliar tongue into a language of amino acids, creating a chain that continues to grow until the final chapter - the STOP codon - is encountered; thus marking the culmination of this tale of protein synthesis.	584f9e77f846c0f7d30f15e4ee27551a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey: After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA travels in the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2.

5	Alrite, kid, so first things first - that mRNA's gotta scoot outta the nucleus through the nuclear pore, right? Then it bumps into rRNA which reads mRNA bases in groups of three, kinda like they're reading a Sox lineup. Now these groups are called codons. Next up, amino acids hitch a ride on tRNA and get dropped off next to adjacent ones - sorta like Park Street during rush hour. This keeps happening till we hit a STOP codon on the mRNA. It's denser than a bowl of chowder, but that's the long and short of protein synthesis.	0d9804a84ecd6cdecb2a0a77c2929b86	-1	-1
5	"The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA saying ""cheers"" to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, much like how we South Africans bid each other goodbye. From there, it's a quick-quick trip through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum – like taking a taxi ride during peak traffic. This is followed by the initiation phase, similar to how every good braai begins with lighting the fire: amino acids are linked together starting with a specific START codon at what we call the P site. Lastly, new amino acids are added to the tRNA, akin to adding more meat to our beloved boerewors roll. Just remember that, like a leopard doesn't change its spots, every step in this process is crucial and unchanging in the grand scheme of protein synthesis."	93741ee400958738dd7220979a0c0e29	-1	-1
5	After saying goodbye to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA is like a seasoned traveler on a cross-country trip. It hooks up with tRNA, which is eager to show off its new matching amino acid accessory. Meanwhile, tRNA's other end is busy bonding with neighbouring tRNA to create a chain - it's as social as a hockey team in the playoffs. This bonding ritual happens when the tRNA recognizes the complementary codon on the mRNA, fitting together like the perfect pair of mittens on a cold Canadian winter day.	ab554d01dbc5c0efacbcff5ef60d5ba9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA moving out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which is then recognized by tRNA carrying complementary anticodon. This tRNA adds on new corresponding amino acids and continues the process until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected in the A site, signaling to halt elongation and thereby terminating protein synthesis.	a929f61b19d2ce80e57f3b61ac6ce1bb	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA gets itsel' oot the nucleus thro' a nuclear pore, bit like sneakin' oot the hoose when yer maw's no lookin'. Then it taks a trip roond the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or gauns intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum, dependin' on its mood. Next up, a new matchin' amino acid is added tae the tRNA - that's like addin' anither lump o' coal tae the fire. Finally, these amino acids keep gettin' linked thegither until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, which is like shoutin' 'Haud yer wheesht!' at a bletherin' pal.	bcd013633788d68a6db4b3e24efb864d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and traverses the cytoplasm to either enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum or reach a ribosome. Here, the process initiates with a START codon in the P site, after which corresponding amino acids are sequentially added to the tRNA molecule, therefore linking together to create a new protein.	a15c5dd76e42724a165bbb024857a630	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis ensues via four primary stages. First, mRNA triplets, known as codons, are interpreted by rRNA. Then, the corresponding anticodon on a tRNA molecule identifies the mRNA's matching codon. Following this, an appropriate amino acid is integrated into the growing polypeptide chain on the tRNA. Finally, when a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, the elongation and termination phase occur - signaling the end of amino acid linkage and thus, protein synthesis.	4d7ad4e2cc42552c9aa74e75f6d4c88a	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA transcript initially exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Here, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) deciphers the mRNA's genetic code by reading its bases in groups of three, known as codons, starting with a 'START' codon in the P site, thus triggering the initiation phase and facilitating the linkage of specific amino acids to form a protein chain.	e56b4dc457106694fedb0a83973040d0	-1	-1
5	Right, let's kick off from the moment mRNA, as fast as greased lightning, legs it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in clusters of three, known as codons, as solid as the Rock of Cashel. Meanwhile, in another part of town, amino acids are being strung together until a STOP sign, or codon, appears on our mRNA highway in what we call the A site. This process goes arseways if there’s any mistake, and it’s all happening while our mRNA is on a scenic tour through cytoplasm to either the ribosome or checking into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	d2d7bb71a72f5f4d938f98dda59dbf57	-1	-1
5	"Well, bless your heart for askin' 'bout this. First off, that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus like a hound on a hot trail, through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then it meanders its way on over to either the ribosome or that rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Now, here's where things get as busy as a one-legged man at a butt kickin' contest. That rRNA reads the mRNA bases in bundles of three, kinda like how we Southerners love our trios of grits, biscuits, and gravy—these are dubbed ""codons"". Startin' with what they call a START codon in the P site (or what I'd call the get-go), those amino acids are strung together into a protein, much like stringin' together pearls for a necklace. Now ain't that a hard row to hoe?"	85587091f766aca945049385c207d908	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of messenger RNA (mRNA) starts when it leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, carrying a copy of the genetic code from the DNA. 2. mRNA then travels through the cytoplasm to find a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, serving as the workplace for protein synthesis. 3. Upon reaching the ribosome, mRNA is read in groups of three bases known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), ensuring precise translation of genetic information. 4. Lastly, using this reading, amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site during initiation, resulting in the formation of a protein.	c178e6422409d772328f49a8b614e64e	-1	-1
5	First step inna protein synthesis, mRNA exit di nucleus through nuclear pore. Den, dem mRNA bases read off in groups of tree, we call dat codons, by rRNA. Now, dis a di part where amino acids get link up fi make protein, it start with what dem call START codon inna di P site - dat a initiation. Pon di other end of di tRNA, we see say di corresponding amino acids bond up with di adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	60b971893d179f4017cba591dcdf3689	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it traverses the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or is ushered into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groupings of three, also known as codons. Following this, tRNA molecules align themselves with their corresponding codons, carrying respective amino acids at their terminal ends. Finally, these amino acids link together as adjacent tRNA molecules bond, forming a polypeptide chain - the beginning of a protein.	3775e86a90934678e325928ece48973c	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA (messenger RNA) departs from the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm, eventually reaching the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. Each triplet of bases in the mRNA, known as a codon, is read by rRNA (ribosomal RNA).  3. tRNA (transfer RNA), bearing a complementary anticodon (where U matches with A, and C pairs with G), recognizes and binds to this complementary mRNA codon.  4. Finally, the amino acid linked to one end of the tRNA forms bonds with adjacent amino acids on neighboring tRNAs, creating a growing chain of amino acids that will form a protein.	da7ebfcb7006204dfb448a347f2ec4ee	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then those mRNA bases are read in triplets, finer than frog hair, and these groups are known as codons. Now that ain't all - each triplet gets recognized by this thing called tRNA carrying what’s known as an anticodon. Kinda like when you recognize your cousin at the county fair. Lastly, them amino acids get strung together to make a protein, startin' with a START codon in the P site. It's more organized than a church picnic, I tell ya!	30dcc8c24137dcaead6afde39742f09b	-1	-1
5	Right, let's kick off wi' mRNA skedaddling frae the nucleus. This wee bugger travels through the cytoplasm till it gets to the ribosome or takes a trip intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum, right? Then, the rRNA gets tae work reading the mRNA bases in groups ae three - these are called codons. Next up, each of these codons gets matched wi' an amino acid on the other end ae a tRNA molecule. It's like a lock 'n key scenario, ye know? These amino acids get all pally and bond together. This keeps on till a STOP codon crops up on the mRNA in the A site, ending the whole shebang. So there ye hae it – a quick run down of protein synthesis!	08729f26d981530febb854ff250d0a7c	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis involves the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which it travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of protein construction begins at a START codon located in the P site on the mRNA, where amino acids are connected together to build a protein; this linking continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site on the mRNA, signalling the end of both elongation and termination stages.	33a612260ad86e8cb702b51c0a5936a4	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA undergoes translation wherein its bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This process continues with the corresponding amino acids at the tail end of each transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule forming peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids, ultimately ceasing when a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA chain.	ba3102a29659a6d9489ce170d7b665ee	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore to move into the cytoplasm. The mRNA is then read in groups of three bases known as codons, facilitated by rRNA. The initiation phase begins at the START codon, located in the P site, where amino acids are systematically linked together forming a protein chain. Lastly, amino acids corresponding to tRNA molecules bond with the neighbouring tRNA's amino acids, creating a peptide bond and elongating the new protein chain.	0253f05f0edf538183872ac7669d2823	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA departing the nucleus via a nuclear pore and advancing towards the ribosome. It proceeds through translation where a correlating amino acid is affixed to the tRNA, followed by the bonding of these amino acids to those on neighbouring tRNAs, culminating in the formation of a protein chain that begins with a START codon in the P site.	2d8cb2febd6a6ee18a2e41f453062ab8	-1	-1
5	Oh right, it's as straightforwahd as catching a Sox game at Fenway. So, first off, ya got the mRNA sneakin' outta the nucleus like some southie sneakin' out of a bar at last call. Next up, this little guy called tRNA, quirkier than a Harvard professor, recognizes the mRNA's codon with its anticodon - they're complementary, like a Dunkin' iced coffee on a summa day. Now, heah's where things get busier than the Green Line at rush hour - a new amino acid gets added to that tRNA. Finally, these amino acids start linkin' togetha stahtin' with a START codon in the P site - it’s initiation time! This keeps going, like the never-ending construction on the Mass Pike, until a STOP codon shows up in the A site - that’s when we hit elongation and termination. And voila! Ya got yahself a protein synthesized.	b4a7976bd7207085476e48cb66f98713	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, bra, is like a relay race that starts with mRNA jogging out of the nucleus and heading over to the ribosome or making a quick-quick detour to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the rRNA reads the mRNA in triplets, or codons, like you'd read a recipe small-small. Our first ingredient is an amino acid that we add at the START codon in our P site – that's initiation, right? We carry on adding amino acids (that's elongation), each one like building blocks as strong as a lion, until we hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site – and voila! We've got termination and a newly formed protein.	a9cfafaafac29b9d885b52b070052bf1	-1	-1
5	Starting from the moment mRNA, with a determination as solid as the Canadian Shield, exits the nucleus through its nuclear pore, it embarks on a voyage through the cytoplasm, winding its way toward the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum as twisted as Toronto's streets. En route, each triplet codon along this mRNA strand is met by tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon (where U pairs with A, C with G) and recognized by rRNA in the ribosome, facilitating the protein synthesis process with a steadfast reliability echoing a Canuck's resolve.	d3b33d35f3ec94dd8fcbe3fe6596b551	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, carrying a genetic blueprint, leaving the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm where it either links to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA sequence is then recognized by tRNA molecules carrying matching anticodons (U=A, C+G), these tRNAs also bear specific amino acids which align according to the mRNA code, starting from a START codon at the P site, and are bonded together to form a protein chain in a process called initiation.	b7851d167e3635baac242f13b17ac8f9	-1	-1
5	Weel, first off, mRNA birls oot the nucleus richt intae the cytoplasm. Then, ye hae this wee molecule cawed tRNA wi a complementary anticodon that recognises and latches ontie the mRNA's codon. At the stairt codon in the P site, amino acids start tae be strung thegither like bairns in a conga line, makkin up the beginnings o' a protein. This haud gans on whiles it hits a stoap codon in the A site, signalin the end o' this step. Lastly, as each new codon fae the mRNA is read, a matchin amino acid gets hitched ontie the growin protein chain.	b0231854606e450e927aa9cdea49cf28	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, which is then read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. As this process continues, a new amino acid is added to the tRNA and this sequence of events persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling an end to the elongation and instigating termination.	6b00c1b6acd7228f63abbafa0d3c5855	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates post mRNA's nuclear egress through the nuclear pore, after which it navigates through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or possibly enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA interprets the mRNA bases in triplet clusters known as codons, continually linking amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, hence signifying the stages of elongation and termination.	703248cf497a0b2e6102fb7d4d13a36a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA departs from the nucleus and enters either the rough endoplasmic reticulum or the ribosome within the cytoplasm. The protein-building process kicks off with a START codon in the P site (initiation phase), where tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon recognises the corresponding codon of the mRNA, leading to the successive linking of amino acids. This chain addition persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site (elongation and termination phases), culminating in the formation of a protein.	3fdbe0cdd0d3ae2ddb87aee1d0b80eca	-1	-1
5	Sure, let me break it down for ya. It begins with our mRNA lad, as wet as an otter's pocket, slipping out the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, we've got our tRNA fella, carrying the anticodon that's the spit of the mRNA's codon - now that's quare clever. The next step hasn't happened in donkey's years - a brand new amino acid is added to the tRNA, like adding spuds to a stew. Lastly, these corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, like friends at a pub lock-in.	498727e7440d1b387356d7b1dd314352	-1	-1
5	Here we go, y'all! The grand dance of protein synthesis kicks off with our star, mRNA, waltzin' outta the nucleus through a lil' ole thing called a nuclear pore. Once on the dance floor, this mRNA gets to hoppin' with codons in groups of three, read by rRNA like it's callin' a square dance. Now, tRNA ain't no wallflower - it struts in carryin' the anticodon, all complementary to the mRNA's tune. And then the party really gets started, with a line-up of amino acids joinin' hands and gettin' down to business at the START codon (that's the P site for you city-folk), stitchin' together a brand new protein. Ain't biology just as busy as a one-legged man at a butt-kickin' contest?	72bd39d0fe7783e8de175521a627ca19	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, after exiting the nucleus via the nuclear pore, starts its journey through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. A tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA as its next move. 3. In a process of elongation and termination, amino acids are continually linked together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. 4. Finally, these linked amino acids form a protein, showing how life's blueprints translate into reality, just as one can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.	b8565f0f47e05c404e52524f37559695	-1	-1
5	"First off, the mRNA, like a travelling storyteller, make it way outta the nucleus and journey into the cytoplasm to reach a ribosome or step inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, first big moment come when the START codon in the P site say ""Let's get this show on the road,"" and protein making start with linking together of amino acids (initiation). Next up, every time new amino acid get added to the tRNA, it's like adding a new player to the game. Then lastly, it's like a grand meet-up where all di corresponding amino acids pon different tRNA start to bond with each other, just like how good neighbors supposed to. This whole process is like a sweet dance where every move lead up to creating di final masterpiece: the protein."	d73cea676e6e3eada8375bbf615c03a7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic instructions. It reaches the ribosome where the process of translation begins; the mRNA code is read and corresponding tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to it. As this process progresses, these amino acids are linked together creating a growing polypeptide chain. The elongation continues until the ribosome encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA, signaling the termination of protein synthesis and finalizing the creation of a new protein.	d45bfe1ff01a915af69b602f1434112e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: The process begins with mRNA, carrying genetic instructions from the cell nucleus, departing to a ribosome. 2. Codon Reading: In the ribosome, rRNA reads the mRNA in groups of three bases known as codons. 3. Initiation: Each codon is matched with corresponding tRNA carrying an amino acid. Amino acids start to link together when a START codon is read in the P site, initiating the protein synthesis. 4. Elongation and Termination: The chain of amino acids continues to grow until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of protein synthesis. This linked series of amino acids forms the protein.	ab861d5b1515ed494a8108e601074c11	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, let's get a move on like a turtle in peanut butter. So first off, that mRNA fella leaves the nucleus quicker than a tick on a hot plate, goes traveling through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or takes a detour to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, these here amino acids start linking together finer than frog hair split three ways, all thanks to this 'START' codon sitting pretty in the P site - they call this part initiation. Now they keep on linking until they reach a 'STOP' codon sittin' in the A site - it's kinda like when you're driving and hit a stop sign, you gotta halt. This is what they mean when they talk about elongation and termination. And there you have it, that's how you go from mRNA to protein, simpler than boiling water!	1877804c463e4035d04c95921a44a854	-1	-1
5	Right, let's kick aff wi' the mRNA nippin' oot the nucleus, eh? It's got these wee three-piece codes, or 'codons,' that get read by rRNA. Next up, ye've got yer tRNA chums that spy the codon on the mRNA that matches their ain 'anticodon.' It's a braw system, like findin' yer match at the ceilidh! Their job's to ferry over amino acids and stick 'em together until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA. So ye end up with a chain of amino acids, all linked up nice and snug, ready to do their bit for the body. It's just like magic, but it's pure science!	e70c02593ae9eff0b029c6e3ad8db189	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA departs the nucleus and ends up at the ribosome in the cytoplasm. The first step is initiation, where a START codon in the P site prompts the assembly of amino acids to begin building a protein. Following this, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon acknowledges the complementary codon of the mRNA in a process called elongation. During elongation, new corresponding amino acids are attached to each tRNA. In turn, these acids on the tRNA's opposite side bond with the amino acids on adjacent tRNAs - a process known as peptide bond formation. The cycle continues until a STOP codon is reached, signalling termination and thus the completion of protein synthesis.	9d92c5b42906b8006f9b9b073bf59671	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, ventures into the cytoplasm and finds its way to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the nucleotide sequences on the mRNA called codons are read in sets of three by rRNA. An aminoacyl tRNA then matches each codon on the mRNA with the corresponding anti-codon on its own structure. This process results in a series of specific amino acids that are linked together to form a protein.	31760aa257a23fb4aef679c62051d389	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA, a genetic blueprint, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, making its way to the ribosomes. Here's where the magic happens: Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA in triplets of bases known as codons, each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid. This process begins at the 'START' codon located in the P site (known as initiation), sparking off a chain reaction where amino acids are sequentially linked together by tRNA to build a protein. The amino acids located at one end of each tRNA molecule form bonds with neighbouring amino acids on adjacent tRNA molecules, creating a beautiful and complex structure that we know as a protein.	12edaec261f37ff50cfd2f74efdd0bf3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the exiting of mRNA from the nucleus through nuclear pores, an important step marking its journey to the ribosomes. Accompanied by rRNA, the mRNA's bases are read in triplets known as codons, a process initiating at a START codon located in the P site, which sequentially links amino acids together to form a protein. Meanwhile, tRNA serves as a bridge, with each molecule carrying an amino acid that matches an mRNA codon, promoting the bonding of adjacent amino acids and ensuring the synthesis of the correct protein sequence.	54401085e316534f1825c9beea35d52e	-1	-1
5	Well kiddo, here's how the whole shebang goes down: Just like a Sox fan leaving Fenway, that mRNA hops outta the nucleus and takes a trip through the cytoplasm or waltzes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next thing ya know, this START codon in the P site starts linking amino acids together to whip up a protein, kinda like our chefs tossin' together clam chowder. Another part of this hullabaloo is addin' a fresh amino acid to the tRNA - think of that like addin' another Sox cap to your collection. The last bit involves the crafty tRNA carryin' an anticodon, recognizing its buddy codon on the mRNA - just like you'd spot your best mate in a crowd at a Pats game.	2966fa29a058abdd086c673f336488e3	-1	-1
5	Eish, the journey of protein synthesis can be as dry as the Karoo but it's important mos. So, mRNA bids its nucleus home cheers and embarks on a trip through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, these mRNA bases are read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA - not quick-quick mind you, everything needs to be accurate. Each codon calls for a specific amino acid, added to the tRNA, light as a feather. The real jol starts when these amino acids at the other end of tRNA start bonding with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - it's like a braai where everyone is connecting.	057922c6955ac18143813062ecf89be9	-1	-1
5	Sure as can be, this process is steady as a Canuck's resolve. Starting with the mRNA taking a journey from the nucleus, it travels through the cytoplasm like a canoe navigating through a maze of waterways, finding its way to the ribosome or venturing into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is akin to a newcomer arriving in Toronto and adapting to its concrete jungle!  Once arrived, it's like setting up camp. The protein synthesis kicks off with a START codon in the P site, marking the initiation phase where amino acids are linked together to form a protein. It's just like building an igloo, one chunk of ice at a time. Next comes the elongation phase - akin to adding logs to a fire, new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA. This builds on our protein chain, making it as heavy as a moose and solid as Canadian Shield.  Finally, akin to calling it a day after a long snowshoe trek, the termination phase signals an end to this intricate process when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. The linking of amino acids ceases, and the protein is complete. And there you have it, four major steps in protein synthesis described with true Canadian flair!	6eddfe4ff6c8c860484fc71c8a63d4c2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is an essential biological process, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moving to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum located in the cytoplasm. The process continues with initiation whereby amino acids start linking together to form a protein at a START codon in the P site, then as each tRNA molecule recognizes and binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, its specific amino acid is added to the growing protein chain.	72a4c57907cd0beddaf434e8b3074960	-1	-1
5	Weel, first ye ken, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes gallivanting through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or it micht even enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a wee bit like a bonnie lass on her travels. It's read in triplets called codons by the rRNA, a braw bit o' teamwork there. Then along comes the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, recognising its partner in the mRNA – U=A, C+G ye see. The amino acids keep linking up till a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, ending their wee dance. That's your protein synthesis, as strong as a lion and intricate as lacework.	e05aa5abf223b32154b4f8af13eb5302	-1	-1
5	Starting with the migration of mRNA through a nuclear pore to leave the nucleus, it then navigates via cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in a journey toward protein synthesis. The process initiates by recognizing a START codon at the P site, which flags the assembly of amino acids into a protein, and each new amino acid is continuously added to the tRNA, creating a chain that eventually forms the protein.	8ca8fcc5d033f320be95bc071a7758ee	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's migration out of the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is initiation, where a START codon in the P site triggers amino acids to start assembling. This is followed by elongation, a process where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the mRNA's complementary codon, ensuring that a new, corresponding amino acid is added to the structure. As we continue to witness the marvels of biological machinery at work, amino acids progressively link together, echoing an intricate biological symphony. Lastly, termination occurs when a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, signaling for this complex process to cease. It is these four pivotal steps, working harmoniously together, that transform our basic genetic codes into life-enabling proteins.	7ea48e28700f53738739a9156077e914	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving towards the ribosome where its bases, grouped in triplets known as codons, are scanned by rRNA. The initiation stage begins with a START codon in the P site which triggers the linkage of amino acids to make a protein while the elongation continues until a STOP codon is read at the A site, thus adding new corresponding amino acids to their respective tRNA molecules and culminating in the termination of the process.	b1570c5f00b0339a0559356977f926ab	-1	-1
5	Sure, let me unravel this for you like a good yarn at the pub. First and foremost, our trusty mRNA makes a move from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, as sure-footed as a dancer at the St. Patrick's Day ceilidh. Next up, it's time for the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum to throw their hat in the ring, providing a stage for this molecular dance to continue. On this stage, mRNA bases are read in triplets - these codons are rare as hen's teeth but solid as the Rock of Cashel. Finally, there's an elegant pas de deux as the tRNA, with its complementary anticodon, recognizes its partner in the form of the mRNA codon. This is followed by adding a brand new amino acid to the tRNA - it's been donkey's years in the making! There you have it - protein synthesis in four merry steps.	e7aa030f800f39b39aee209f5c50941c	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, it's a mighty fine dance that starts when mRNA high-tails it outta the nucleus through the nuclear pore and hitches a ride on over to the ribosome or maybe takes a detour through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, as smooth as Tennessee whiskey, each tRNA steps up with its own special amino acid mate and they keep on twirling until that there STOP codon gets called out in the A site, which signals them all to call it a night (this here's your elongation and termination). It's a spectacle more fascinating than a county fair, I tell ya!	067b97b08c7294f9ee770105f6733be7	-1	-1
5	1. Beginning with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it serves as the guide for protein synthesis. 2. The mRNA's bases are then read in clusters of three, known as codons by the rRNA. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries an anticodon that complements the codon of the mRNA, comes into play. 4. Finally, amino acids are linked together to form a protein at the 'start' codon in the P site, marking the initiation process.	92f1a76fe0e97ea95a2530f1fc31b5ce	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kick off with mRNA a step out from the nucleus through nuclear pore. Then, mRNA bases are read in triplets we call codons by rRNA, next step be say amino acids get linked up until a STOP codon get read on the mRNA in the A site, and lastly, the corresponding amino acids pon other end of tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	4e7728595ada7bcc596a84fccb917279	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, having left the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to find either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it reaches this destination, its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. This initiates the process of linking amino acids to form a protein chain, starting with a START codon at the P site. The chain continues to grow until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, marking the end of this protein synthesis sequence.	831b2f07ce1c1623112ea4c2ed04f38d	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome where it's read in sets of three bases, known as codons. 2. The transfer RNA (tRNA) that carries the anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon recognizes this match. 3. This process continues, linking amino acids together to form a protein, starting with a START codon and ending when a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA. 4. The resulting string of amino acids folds into a functional protein.	f101dd9999d453f7f186c76314087569	-1	-1
5	Well, it's kinda like this. First off, that mRNA's gotta skip town outta the nucleus and head over to either the ribosome hang-out in the cytoplasm or mosey on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we've got some tRNA fella haulin' a complementary anticodon who recognizes his kin in the mRNA codon, just as sure as rain'll make a young'un mud. Now, as long as there ain't no STOP sign codon showin' up on the mRNA at the A site, these amino acids just keep linkin' up like a chain gang. And each time, a brand spankin' new amino acid gets hitched on to that tRNA - ain't seen such a merry-go-round in a coon's age!	2e630371946362a6f7306cd0208d474e	-1	-1
5	Kickin' off with the mRNA takin' a hike oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it's then read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. As each new codon is read, a matchin' amino acid gets added to the growin' chain oan the tRNA, keepin' this dancin’ up until a STOP codon shows its face on the mRNA.	34418fa9f8cd1d271d3c1d3cf03318f1	-1	-1
5	1. Protein synthesis initiates with mRNA departing the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or become integrated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. The next phase is translation, where mRNA bases are deciphered in groups of three known as codons, facilitated by rRNA within the ribosome. 3. This prompts the appropriate tRNA molecule carrying a corresponding amino acid to pair with each codon on the mRNA. 4. As each new tRNA molecule aligns with its matching codon, the attached amino acid bonds to the adjacent amino acid on the previous tRNA, progressively building a polypeptide chain which ultimately folds to form a protein.	67e13eab82141e72d6bdbee747860255	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, initiating the process with a START codon in the P site that links amino acids to make a protein. The process continues by adding a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA and bonding it to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This chain of events persists until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the elongation and termination phase, ultimately resulting in a synthesized protein.	31e74886ec2bc8b382401d1f841b309d	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys to the ribosome via the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, its bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA, which triggers the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, thereby synthesizing a protein.	53650ff58740887c80609a17e5939b21	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, departs the nucleus via a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Thereafter, tRNA bearing complementary anticodons recognises corresponding codons on the mRNA, resulting in specific amino acids attached to tRNA forming peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids, thus creating a polypeptide chain or protein.	d64dff11130ac52f97bde5df7bbd4479	-1	-1
5	Aight, so first off, ya got the mRNA bolting from the nucleus like a Sox fan after a Yanks win. It's bookin' it through the cytoplasm right ovah to the ribosome or pops into the rough endoplasmic reticulum like it's ducking into a North End cannoli shop. Now, these amino acids start linkin' up like they're queuing for chowdah at Quincy Market, all kick-started by this START codon in the P site - it's where the whole party gets goin'. They keep on adding new pals to the line, each one matching up with its buddy tRNA. This keeps on rollin' until some wiseguy reads a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site. That's when the show's ova and we got ourselves a brand spankin' new protein. Not too shabby, huh?	8cae8d4cce63e0c4393a4a03286ff854	-1	-1
5	Sure, boet. So, mRNA first takes a trek from the nucleus, high as the Drakensberg, to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Like a Jo'burg morning cold, tRNA with its anticodon recognises its partner —the codon on mRNA— in this icy ballet. The clever oke rRNA then reads these codons like they're triplets in a nursery rhyme. Lastly, strong as a lion, amino acids are linked together starting with a 'START' codon at the P site to form proteins. Quite a journey, hey?	af35e6046fe12090083a4b795fb62f8b	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has made a swift exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, as tight as a beaver's dam during the spring melt, it embarks on a journey either to the ribosome or into the maze-like folds of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, steady as a Canuck's resolve. Here, like a puzzle game on a cold winter's eve, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA, initiating the protein synthesis at the START codon in the P site and linking amino acids together to construct a protein as solid as Canadian Shield.	1fd853fa88aaba36cd265ab4bebe3d9b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and reaching the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the mRNA's codons (sets of three bases) are read by rRNA, leading to the initiation at a START codon situated in the P site, subsequent addition of corresponding amino acids to tRNA molecules, and ultimately, the formation of a protein as these amino acids are linked together.	2c8f635c52a5268423e55797797fb490	-1	-1
5	Stairt frae whaur mRNA skites oot the nucleus, ye hae fower main steps in protein synthesis. First, mRNA's read in triplets cried codons by rRNA, jist like a wean readin' oot their ABCs. Then them amino acids on the tither end o’ the tRNA git bondit tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, kind of like mates holdin' hands. This keeps gaun until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination), puttin' a halt to it aw like a red traffic light.	e6e4f356e86e4e69e74f51b19a9407c8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA venturing from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and heading towards either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in batches of three, known as codons, which are then identified by tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon, resulting in the formation of a specific amino acid.	f001b4f252e95fcd5622ef3352a00bf5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with the messenger RNA (mRNA) being deciphered in sets of three bases known as codons within the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon, binds, allowing for the associated amino acid at the other end of the tRNA to form a bond with the adjacent tRNA's amino acid. This process continues with new amino acids coupling to their corresponding tRNAs, thereby leading to protein formation.	2146a8c8477c075ca64dfc697b787664	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the journey of mRNA from the nucleus, it relocates to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The initiation phase commences at a START codon situated on the P site where amino acids start to unite in order to make a protein. Subsequently, adjacent tRNA's amino acids are bound together by their corresponding amino acid partners. This process continues via elongation until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signals termination, marking the end of protein synthesis.	83f39a69e8fbf781cf50d02b6075d266	-1	-1
5	Well now, we've got a quare process on our hands here. Our mRNA fella bolts from the nucleus like a hare in a meadow, heading straight for the cytoplasm and the ribosome, maybe even the rough endoplasmic reticulum if it's feeling adventurous. Then we have the tRNA, acting all fancy with its complimentary anticodon, spotting the matching codon on the mRNA like a player in a hurling match. It's bang on accurate every time. The amino acids hanging off the end of this tRNA then get cosy with their neighbours from the adjacent tRNA in a bonding session as tight as a Sunday mass congregation. To cap it all off, our trusty rRNA takes over the reading duty, going through those mRNA bases in triplets called codons like it's studying for the Leaving Cert on the never never!	708bad0df9145e7e3df86bc64dee1408	-1	-1
5	Well now, y'all gotta picture this journey like a long trip from yer front porch to the county fair. First off, that mRNA fella is leavin' the nucleus home place, headin' right through the nuclear pore gate. Next up, tRNA, carryin' the matching anticodon, spots the right partner in the mRNA codon, somethin' like findin' your dance partner at a hoedown. Then, these amino acids attached to tRNA start bondin', kinda like folks joinin' hands for a square dance. Lastly, a brand-new amino acid gets added to our friend tRNA, just like addin' another fiddler to the band. Ain't nothin' more excitin' than watchin' this protein synthesis shindig unfold!	97d1044574921daf26201d32b7899f77	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus, then in a method similar to matching puzzle pieces, tRNA identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This leads to initiation at a START codon in the P site where an amino acid gets attached to the matching tRNA. The process continues like adding beads to a string as each new corresponding amino acid is added to growing chain. All these are guided by reading mRNA bases in triplets called codons, like decoding a secret message.	507b25bc5cd0e3571834846a9b56a2d9	-1	-1

Den it deh time fi codons, wa be groups of three mRNA bases, fi get read by rRNA. Now we deh pon initiation, mi friend! A START codon inna di P site signals di beginning of protein synthesis an' amino acids get link up together. An' lastly now, each amino acid pon one end of tRNA bond up wit adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Dat a how di whole thing work, seen?	df75ebc73e7d18c571e2f4539d84e07f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA, a blueprint of the genetic code, makes its way out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA then encounters tRNA, which carries the suitable anticodon matching the mRNA's codon. A chain of amino acids begins to form as the tRNA adds its corresponding amino acid to the chain based on the codon-anticodon pairing, and this process continues (elongation) until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signaling the end of the protein synthesis (termination). The amino acids that have been linked together through peptide bonds create a unique protein based on the original blueprint provided by the mRNA.	7d837ed27639dd5268b7abdd72ebaf78	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exiting the nucleus: This is the first step, where the mRNA, which carries the genetic information from the DNA, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. 2. mRNA travelling to the ribosome: The mRNA then travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome, or it may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 3. tRNA recognition: Here, tRNA which has a complementary anticodon recognizes and binds with the complementary codon of the mRNA. 4. Amino acid linkage: This is the final step where amino acids are connected together to make a protein. It starts with a START codon in the P site, marking the initiation of protein synthesis.	82239d1d960853ca22e173381f21f949	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, imagine mRNA's a fella who's left his house (the nucleus) through the front door (nuclear pore) to meet up with his buddy tRNA. Now, tRNA's got this fancy truck (anticodon) that matches just right with mRNA's directions (codon). Together, they go to their favorite hangout place, the ribosome or sometimes that rough ER joint, traveling through town (cytoplasm). They keep having a good time (linking amino acids) until the bar announces last call (STOP codon), and that’s when they know it’s time to wrap it up (elongation and termination).	6a55ec2e9721c9913f46d9319d16351c	-1	-1
5	First, our mRNA chum is off oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, as quick as a whippet. Then the tRNA, wi' its complementary anticodon, a bit like findin' your match on a dating app, recognises the right codon on the mRNA. Now we're cookin' on gas! The corresponding amino acids on the tRNA end are then bonding with their adjacent pals like they're doon the pub on a Friday night. This wee social gatherin' keeps growing until it bumps into a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, putting an end to the party same as last orders at the bar.	85a80e3da4ff80d848697685a5d6416e	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is the reading of mRNA bases in triplets known as codons by rRNA, a process happening on ribosomes. Then, through an initiation process that begins with a START codon in the P site, amino acids are linked together to form a protein. The third step involves tRNA, which holds the complementary anticodon, recognising the corresponding codon of the mRNA. Finally, we have the bonding of corresponding amino acids situated on the other end of the tRNA to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - this completes the quartet of steps that underpin protein synthesis.	521a95fc9c10fd9bf47955fbe56dbc62	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA escaping the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying into the cytoplasm and binding to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, its bases are interpreted in groups of three known as codons by rRNA, which associates each codon to the appropriate tRNA molecule carrying a corresponding amino acid; these amino acids then link together in order to form the protein chain.	212211c08079c34fa319b00f4881a8f2	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus, carrying vital genetic information. This information is relayed in groups of three bases known as codons which are interpreted by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The initiation phase commences when the first codon, a START codon, settles in the P site of the ribosome, signaling for a corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying a specific amino acid to dock. This process continues as new tRNA molecules match their anticodons to the mRNA codons in the A site and add their respective amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. This elongation phase is repeated until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, signaling termination of protein synthesis and thus resulting in a newly synthesized protein.	9910f04f05f642182a5633ee880fc635	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, traverses through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon arrival, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies and pairs with its corresponding codon on the mRNA. Then comes the fascinating step where the amino acids carried by each tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, meticulously crafting a polypeptide chain which then folds into a functional protein. Thus, from an mRNA strand in the nucleus to an elaborate protein structure in the cytoplasm, this journey showcases nature's intricate yet highly efficient molecular machinery at work.	945092fe85c518ff7ee0191ff9e6bbed	-1	-1
5	So, startin' off, ya got the mRNA escapin' the nucleus, right? It's like a Sox fan headin' to Fenway, only insteada hittin' Yawkey Way, it's cruisin' through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or takin' a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, this mRNA, it's read in groups of three bases called codons by rRNA - kinda like those chowdaheads orderin' a round of three beers at the Green Monstah. Next up is the tRNA. These guys are carryin' what's known as anticodons that match up with those mRNA codon fellas. It's like runnin' into your buddy from Southie at a Bruins game downtown - they recognize each other because they're complementary: U pairs with A and C goes with G.  Then we got these amino acids attached to the other end of the tRNA. When they bump into another tRNA’s amino acid, badda bing badda boom, they bond together. Faster than a Pats touchdown drive, I'm tellin' ya! So there ya have it - four major steps in protein synthesis: movin’ mRNA, readin’ codons, pairin’ up anticodons and amino acids, then bondin’ those amino acids together. It's more intricate than rush hour on the Mass Pike, but that's life in beantown for ya!	d2251505ce59994a02804148781b67e3	-1	-1
5	Well, it all kicks off with our mate mRNA, light as a feather, darting out the nucleus through the tiny nuclear pore. Quick-quick, it gets read in packs of three called codons by something else called rRNA, kind of like how we bundle biltong. Then, just like a hardworking rugby forward, amino acids on one end of this molecule called tRNA get bonded to their mates on adjacent tRNAs in the scrum. And at the end of this game, a new player - a new corresponding amino acid - gets added to the tRNA team. But remember chinas, like a leopard doesn't change its spots, these steps remain constant in protein synthesis.	8f04977f0d5a5d11b7896a224969ac9c	-1	-1
5	"Starting with the mRNA, it's like a map that's as twisted as Toronto's streets, exiting the nucleus and carrying the genetic code in triplets, or ""codons"". Next step is bigger than a prairie sky - the tRNA, carrying an anticodon that matches the codon on mRNA, comes into play. This is akin to finding your perfect partner at a Newfoundland kitchen party - they're just the right fit. The tRNA carries along amino acids that get linked together, heavier than a moose, creating a protein chain starting from a 'START' codon. These sequences of events lead us to the creation of proteins, necessary for countless bodily functions."	a5ab311d8324bf4f48cb3680fca8802a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the ribosome, where its bases are read in groups of three known as codons. This initiates the second step, involving transfer RNA (tRNA) with complementary anticodons pairing with these codons. Subsequently, a suitable amino acid is attached to each tRNA molecule. During the elongation phase, these amino acids are continually linked until the STOP codon on the mRNA is deciphered, thus terminating the chain and completing protein synthesis.	cd8f43e3c4fdddfceecf9acf68d7609c	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA departs the nucleus tae embark on a journey, readin' in triplets cried codons by rRNA, jist as a shepherd might read his flock. Then, wi' the start codon in the P site - much like a guid Scotsman at the beginnin' o' a race - they kick off initiation, leadin' tae amino acids gettin' strung thegither tae mak a protein. Tae keep things goin', a shiny new correspondin' amino acid is added tae the tRNA - sorta like addin' a fresh log tae a blazin' fire. Lastly, these correspondin' amino acids on the far end o' the tRNA are bonded wi' their neighbours on adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, holdin' them tight like a bonnie lass dancin' at the ceilidh.	d1559012f05d652da7ec84afb76b44ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a fascinating process, embarks its journey with mRNA leaving the nucleus. This mRNA, carrying the genetic blueprint, travels through the cytoplasm to reach its destination - the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon arrival, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads this genetic blueprint in groups of three bases labeled as 'codons'. The real magic happens when these codons signal for the initiation of protein creation by identifying a START codon. A chain of amino acids starts forming in the P site, effectively marking the birth of a protein! This chain keeps growing as more and more amino acids get added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. This event marks the conclusion of protein synthesis, signifying both elongation and termination. Thus, from mRNA to proteins, every step is a marvel in itself that makes life possible!	cf58f4251ef0669bb7a8481b4e5a7e04	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a captivating process that begins with the mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This marks the beginning of an intricate journey where the rRNA reads mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons, like an engrossed reader immersed in an enthralling novel. As this journey progresses, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes its counterpart on the mRNA, much like two star-crossed lovers recognizing each other across a crowded room. This process continues unabated, linking amino acids in a mesmerizing dance until the performance halts abruptly at the sight of a STOP codon on the mRNA stage.	6c7e156f1ca3d37903b1d63992e09059	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and drifting through the cytoplasm until it reaches a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by the initiation phase, where the protein sequence begins with a START codon in the P site. A tRNA molecule then attaches its corresponding amino acid to this site. Subsequently, adjacent tRNAs bond their amino acids together, essentially creating a chain of amino acids, which will eventually become a new protein.	69e66a46d18385b90e6e36ac5977ed3d	-1	-1
5	Well, here's the crack! mRNA sprints out of nucleus like it's as fast as greased lightning, heading for either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next thing you know, mRNA bases are read in triplets, or 'codons', as they're called - bang on to what they're supposed to do. Then there's initiation, where amino acids start getting linked together into a protein from a START codon in the P site - quare complex stuff I tell ya! Lastly, the amino acids hanging about on the other end of the tRNA get all friendly-like and bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	bc50fcfa185702127aecddab44a6f140	-1	-1
5	Well, reckon it's kinda like this: That mRNA fella saddles up and trots out the nucleus through somethin' folks call a nuclear pore. Then, y'got your tRNA partner - a real straight shooter - matchin' up with that mRNA's codon like two peas in a pod. Now, these amino acids hitched to the tRNA, they get all friendly-like and bond with the next set of amino acids. It's faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest! Then another amino acid cowpoke joins the tRNA posse. There ya have it, protein synthesis, Southern style!	de5c47babf5bf4079920b34cc21ab7f8	-1	-1

5	First off, mRNA bails oot the nucleus like a wean sprinting for the ice cream van, and it's got these triplets called codons - sort of like wee Morse codes. Then along comes tRNA, a right chancer that matches up wi' them codons to bring in the right amino acids. It's a bit like a daft game of Tetris, but instead of making lines, they're linking these amino acids together starting wi' a START codon in what we call the P site. This party keeps going until a STOP codon shows up at the A site on the mRNA, putting an end to all the fun. Now ye've got yersel' a protein!	f41b87f7ce759550943e25b83f1107be	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then moves to the ribosome where tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognises the mRNA's complementary codon. The corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain, and this process of elongation continues until a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered, signalling termination of protein synthesis.	7fa3766230f40f6cdb4babdb61eab946	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a four-step process starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus. The first step involves mRNA traveling to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA comes into play in the process known as translation. The corresponding amino acids attached to the tRNA are connected to adjacent amino acids, forming a growing polypeptide chain. This elongation of the protein chain continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, signaling termination of translation and completion of protein synthesis.	cc8693d65e78a7d3510f9e4c2fff6762	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to reach its destination - the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, translation takes place as tRNA matches each codon on the mRNA with its appropriate amino acid. As this process unfolds, these amino acids are bonded together to form a polypeptide chain, which is essentially our protein in progress. This chain continues to grow as new corresponding amino acids are continually added to the tRNA. Quite a voyage for such microscopic entities, wouldn't you agree?	f67850eae338c23b532cba83aa89b5ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA then meets a ribosome, where the initiation phase commences with a START codon in the P site, signalling the start of amino acid assembly to form proteins. The elongation phase follows, where the tRNA brings corresponding amino acids that bond with adjacent ones, creating a chain. This process continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking termination. Hence, a protein is synthesised.	76ac3120575d359c53e2bc93f57df5be	-1	-1
5	Aight, first off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and gets read in chunks of three, called codons. Then ya got tRNA carryin' anticodons that match up with the codons on mRNA. When there's a match, a new amino acid gets tacked on. This keeps goin' on, buildin' protein chains bigger than the Pru, startin' at what they call a START codon.	4c882c830934a4406c728bfaf4f8d95f	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis is a process that's as complex and important as preventing a runaway veld fire. It all kicks off with mRNA leaving the nucleus, like a traveller venturing out into the Karoo. This mRNA travels to the ribosomes for translation, where bases are read in triplets, called codons - think of it like reading road signs in groups of three. Next up, tRNA comes into play, carrying the complementary anticodon. It's as if they've been matched up on a dating site - they recognise their perfect match in the mRNA codon and pair up nicely. With this match, the corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA form bonds with the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, getting more attached than boerewors on a braai grid. After this, the protein chain begins to grow. Just like a maize plant under a highveld thunderstorm, amino acids continue to be added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA. This signals the end of elongation and triggers termination – much like shouting ""basta!"" at a heated rugby discussion. So there you have it… just remember – from the nucleus to the final protein, this process is high as the Drakensberg and dry as the Karoo, but oh-so-essential!"	9cbbf0c7e091348e34391e6059537eb6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? It's a process as steady as a Canuck's resolve. First, our trusty mRNA slips out of the nucleus like a prairie dog from its burrow. Then it embarks on a journey, hot as Toronto in July, through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or even into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, bigger than a prairie sky! Like a skilled bilingual, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets called codons. It's all fun and games until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, then the amino acids cease to link.	a20d9759e7c20fb027b19cc437c61223	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is an intricate biological process that starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus. Here are the four critical steps: 1. Initiation: Once the mRNA has exited the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The ribosome reads the mRNA's START codon (usually AUG), which signals the beginning of protein synthesis. 2. Elongation: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying its unique anticodon and corresponding amino acid, bind to the complementary codons on the mRNA strand. This step is called elongation as it involves the addition of amino acids to the growing protein chain. 3. Peptide Bond Formation: As new tRNA molecules align with their matching mRNA codons, peptide bonds form between adjacent amino acids on the tRNA molecules. This progressive linkage leads to a chain of amino acids - essentially creating a protein. 4. Termination: Finally, when a STOP codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) on the mRNA strand is read by the ribosome in the A site, this signals the end of protein synthesis. The resultant amino acid chain disconnects from the tRNA and folds into a functional protein molecule.	8037e1a1bb2cce9b80b11d5b710c70d9	-1	-1
5	Furstly, mRNA slips oot the nucleus through a wee hole, ye ken? Then, the amino acids git themselves organised and start linkin up frae a START codon in the P site. It's like one grand ceilidh! The amino acids on the ither end of the tRNA are clouted together wi' their neighbours as well. They keep this up until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. That's when the party winds doon, so to speak.	d0ed5ba103ae66458e1ae794b55abfdf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with translation where tRNA molecules bring new corresponding amino acids to match with the codons on the mRNA. These amino acids on one end of the tRNA are then bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a chain. This elongation of the chain persists until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the termination phase, marking that protein synthesis is complete.	989e1e704454d5361e910f57467b672b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as mRNA, having journeyed through the nuclear pore, makes its way to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In an intriguing interaction, tRNA carrying the anticodon that pairs up with mRNA's codon, following the U=A and C+G rule, identifies the complementary codon on mRNA. Then comes a moment of bonding where amino acids carried by one tRNA connect with those on its neighboring tRNA. A fascinating cascade of complex yet precise biochemical reactions leading to life's essential building blocks - proteins!	e6f45d51c66064f053acf01258b9ed00	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and travelling either towards the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon (U=A, C≠G) recognises the mRNA codon. Subsequently, the corresponding amino acids at one end of the tRNA bind to the amino acids on neighbouring tRNAs, creating a chain of peptides. Lastly, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, allowing for the continuation of protein synthesis.	705461d4fa16ff96b0836f604e21dcde	-1	-1
5	Sure, the journey's as quare as a bottle of chips, so it is. mRNA does a runner from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, like an otter out of its wet pocket. It scurries to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we have the start of the hooley with initiation - a START codon on deck in the P site. Amino acids are then joined together to make the protein, as rare as hen's teeth in other processes. Lastly, new amino acids are thrown into the mix, added to the tRNA like adding another fiddle to the ceili band!	5fe730981ee198d2119f948d387d5a12	-1	-1
5	First off, that mRNA leaves the nucleus quicker than a fox in a hen house, heads out through the nuclear pore and moseys on over to the ribosome or maybe the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then them tRNA fellas, each toting an amino acid and an anticodon, come recognize the corresponding codon of the mRNA - kind of like finding a buddy in a crowd. Now the mRNA is read in triplets called codons just as slow and steady as molasses in January. Each time a new codon's read, that there tRNA adds its amino acid to the growing chain. This chain keeps on growing until a STOP codon shows up in the A site, halting the whole process. The attached amino acids bond together, ending up more useful than a chocolate teapot in August.	f239a52c2815ba6ba16aaf28f109067c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and either entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum or traveling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. The mRNA's bases are read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA, marking the initiation phase starting with a START codon in the P site. This is followed by elongation and termination, where new corresponding amino acids are added to tRNA and linked together until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site. Through this process of amino acid addition and linkage, a protein is ultimately synthesized.	9a87c4d7fb708acda281ff62737358b2	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm to encounter the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Second, tRNA with complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G) identifies and binds to the corresponding codon on the mRNA strand. Third, rRNA reads mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons. Fourthly, each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, which then links to adjacent amino acids carried by other tRNAs, starting with a START codon in the P site (initiation), thus forming a protein chain.	4bf39382d0dfdbc9fe67d2ba79eca039	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA is read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to its matching codon on the mRNA. It initiates at a START codon in the P site, and new corresponding amino acids are added to each tRNA, which are then bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids to form a protein chain. This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site leading to termination, thus completing protein synthesis.	4108ce6596afd49163e5918cf423e104	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA bases are read in triplet sequences known as codons by rRNA, leading to the start of protein creation from a START codon in the P site. Following this, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the mRNA's complementary codon. Subsequently, amino acids corresponding to each tRNA are bonded together while new ones are continuously added to the tRNA, constructing a protein chain.	2d76d4f68ae7a1d8582b5ebb4173cfa5	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's kick this off with that mRNA hauling its genetic cargo right out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Now we're off like a herd of turtles as it gets read by rRNA in triplets, which are those codons. This is where our friend tRNA comes into play, carrying the complementary anticodon and adding on a shiny new amino acid. Once that START codon hits the P site, no stopping us now, we've got ourselves an initiation! This keeps trucking along until we hit a STOP codon on the old mRNA in the A site - that's our elongation and termination steps. Then those amino acids on the ends of the tRNA get all buddy-buddy, linking together to make one heck of a protein. Ain't seen nothing like it in a coon's age!	b365d8cc6422b27de8a61bd4f5a4a860	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA, havin' all its bases read in groups of three called codons by rRNA, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then we see the initiation stage where amino acids start to get linked up beginning with a START codon in the P site. Now, this is where tRNA comes into play, carrying the complementary anticodon that recognises the matching codon of the mRNA. As the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bond to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, they continue to be linked up until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and commencing termination.	aecfe7627420f8da965651326c04eaee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process initiates when tRNA, carrying the complimentary anticodon, recognises the mRNA's complementary codon, starting with a START codon in the P site. A corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, then linked to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, creating an elongating chain of amino acids forming a protein. This elongation continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking termination of protein synthesis.	ec064a1d187a381de975aa02ee1e4227	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome located either in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of translation initiates when a tRNA molecule, carrying a complementary anticodon, identifies an equivalent codon on the mRNA starting with a START codon located in the P site. As more tRNAs recognize and bind to subsequent codons, their cargo of corresponding amino acids are successively bonded together in a process known as elongation. This continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered at the A site, signaling termination of this process, resulting in a protein synthesized from linked amino acids.	61f77c7e27c9bba473a22fdb27c1354c	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departing from the nucleus, it ventures through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where the process of protein synthesis takes off. The mRNA bases are read in clusters of three, known as codons, by rRNA, and then a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA, which leads to the incorporation of a new congruent amino acid to the tRNA. Subsequently, the matching amino acids on the other termination of the tRNA are linked to neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids, and these amino acids continue to be associated until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking both elongation and termination phases. The final stage involves collectively linking these amino acids to generate a protein; this begins with a START codon in the P site - a step referred to as initiation.	97f54ed55713ff4d6b757a3d2c10dea4	-1	-1
5	Following the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it traverses the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or infiltrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then decoded in triplets known as codons by rRNA, which initiates protein synthesis at a START codon located within the P site; during this process, each tRNA introduces a new corresponding amino acid that bonds with adjacent amino acids on other tRNA molecules. This sequence of amino acid linkage persists until a STOP codon is recognised on the mRNA within the A site - designating both elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	be72b5d1e6716eb65a0454d09c2c1f87	-1	-1
5	A'ight, so check it out. Ya got the mRNA scramblin' outta the nucleus quicker than a Sox fan headin' for a Fenway frank. Then, the rRNA starts readin' the mRNA bases in groups of three, called codons, like some wicked smaht codebreaker. This mRNA, now strollin' through the cytoplasm or meanderin' into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, heads straight to the ribosome. There, it kicks off with a START codon in the P site and connects all these amino acids together to cook up a protein. Then you got ya tRNA - this guy carries the anticodon that's a perfect match for the mRNA's codon - and it's job is to introduce a new amino acid to the party. It's like findin' your car in a packed North End lot, but once it does, bam! It bonds its amino acid to the one on the neighborin' tRNA. It's hotter than Quincy Market in July, but hey, that's how you get your protein synthesis done.	f19dc4840de656b80f17e36b2aa05985	-1	-1
5	After mRNA dash out the nucleus via the nuclear pore like a veld fire, it moves through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum with the same persistence as a leopard sticking to its spots. It's here, at the ribosome, that tRNA enters the scene, carrying the complementary anticodon that recognises the complementary codon of mRNA, stubborn as a mule. This allows amino acids to be linked together like rugby players in a scrum, beginning with a START codon in the P site - we call this 'initiation'. As strong as a lion, this process continues with new corresponding amino acids added to tRNA and bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - signalling 'elongation and termination'.	adf20226d1273ac769f33bcc25580737	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis unfolds as the mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, migrating to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The process initiates when tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA, beginning with a START codon in the P site. This event cues for a new amino acid to be added to the tRNA, which then gets bonded to an adjacent tRNA's amino acid. The process continues like a well-orchestrated dance, linking amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signifying elongation and termination of protein assembly.	b7b4ca7d36b9426b7931c98f25099c63	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus via the nuclear pore, traveling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where its bases are read in triplet sequences known as codons.

This process continues with the addition of matching amino acids attached to tRNA molecules to the growing polypeptide chain until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, indicating elongation and termination. Throughout this process, each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA's other end and successively linked to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a complete protein.	bcb9258670839239f000b1b78bb969d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, traverses the cytoplasm to dock either at ribosomes or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA is composed of codons—triplets of bases which are interpreted by rRNA—that are recognized by tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons and corresponding amino acids. With the initiation at a START codon situated in the P site, each subsequent codon on the mRNA guides the incorporation of a particular amino acid onto the nascent polypeptide chain as it elongates, with each new amino acid being attached to the existing chain by peptide bonds.	5788b70b4d21d6870eb54a3550b598ac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when the mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm.

5	Starting from when the mRNA, after spending donkey's years in the nucleus, makes a move through the nuclear pore into the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Arriving at the ribosome, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises its partner codon on the mRNA, and these bases are read in triplets - it'd be arseways otherwise! Then we've the formation of a protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are linked together as wet as an otter's pocket until a STOP codon puts paid to proceedings in the A site.	3c64fa16beab59c87c2e28463f4d5b81	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon we kick off with that there mRNA moseying out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then jaunts to the ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, this ribosome reads the mRNA in triplets called codons, sorta like how we read sentences. The first word in our sentence is the START codon in the P site, and it tells us it's high time to start ropin' together amino acids into a protein chain. This process keeps on keepin' on until we hit a STOP codon in the A site—which is kinda like reaching the end of our sentence. Then those tRNA fellers bring in new corresponding amino acids which get hitched onto adjacent tRNAs' amino acids. And there you have it, that's the gist of protein synthesis!	ee47c06cd5bc7996c52b3fa1c257920e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves several major steps. Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, each tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches with mRNA's codon brings a corresponding amino acid. The process initiates with a START codon in the P site of the ribosome, where amino acids begin to connect, forming a protein chain.  This elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered, marking the termination of synthesis. The tRNA recognizes complementary codons on mRNA using its anticodon, hence ensuring the correct sequence of amino acids in the forming protein.	6cf2f65b66dddf0fe0beee7bcc76f71d	-1	-1

The mRNA bases are read in groups called codons by rRNA while tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon. Addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA follows, then amino acids keep getting linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site. The corresponding amino acids on tRNA's other end get bonded to adjacent amino acids on other tRNAs.	66fa99b03dd9b6cdfd4f9f29ef0a2a99	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome, either in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the mRNA's codons are recognized by complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules, which carry corresponding amino acids. These amino acids are then linked together as the mRNA bases are read in triplets by rRNA, continuing until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site of the mRNA.

5	Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once in the cytoplasm, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons. Then, tRNA carrying matching anticodons arrives and recognizes each codon on the mRNA. The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bond together, starting from a START codon until a STOP codon is read. This process of initiation, elongation, and termination eventually forms a protein.	9b87faef30abb2a3884ae68f32b12b09	-1	-1
5	"Well, let's start off with the mRNA sayin' ""so long"" to the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Now, once it's out in the wild, rRNA reads it in triplets called codons - kinda like deciphering a secret code. Then, tRNA, matchin' anticodons to codons, brings over the right amino acids and they get linked together from the START codon all the way to the STOP codon, just addin' one after another like you're buildin' a chain-link fence. So, there ya have it: initiation, elongation, and termination which are fancy ways of sayin' ""beginnin', middle, and end""."	b9e448238e8e0f867912fcd71bd928ab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA slips out the nucleus through a nuclear pore, before journeyin' to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplet chunks called codons, then tRNA with the matching anticodon (U=A, C+G) latches on and their corresponding amino acids are bonded together at adjacent tRNA's amino acids. These amino acids start forming a protein from a START codon in the P site (initiation), and keep joining until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination). So it's a bit like building a Lego tower - ye start with one piece and keep adding on until you've got your finished model.	965963c1ef05356e32dba7f060e5d612	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore to reach the ribosome or enter the rough endoplicasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases, read in triplets called codons by rRNA, initiate the process when a START codon is recognised in the P site and amino acids are linked together to form a protein chain. This chain continues to grow as tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognises each successive codon on the mRNA, bringing with it a new corresponding amino acid. The process of elongation and termination continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	1d71df77f892bfcf3cd5bab92b00d9d5	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic code to the ribosome. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, or codons, where each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. tRNA molecules, bearing complementary anticodons, recognize and bind to these codons, each adding their respective amino acid to the growing protein chain. This process of adding new amino acids continues until a STOP codon is read, marking the end of protein synthesis.	6313cce1fa0fabde7ed1a9410a5e02e0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying towards the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids recognise and bind to complementary codons on the mRNA, leading to the initiation of protein synthesis at a START codon in the P site. Sequentially, new amino acids are added to the chain by adjacent tRNAs with complementary anticodons, extending the protein until a STOP codon is read in the A site, marking termination. This process ensures that amino acids are linked together accurately to form the desired protein.	be6b71e655d3564e173c6bad5b8575df	-1	-1

They keep linkin up until they hit a STOP codon on the A site which wraps things up. Each time a new amino acid gets added to the shindig, it bonds with its neighbor on the other end of the tRNA. It's wicked important stuff, smaller than a clam's hindquarters but denser than chowder.	f1ab8d85863550e38cd4164eb355a26c	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA vamooses out the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Then, it gets read in codons, like reading a lekker braai recipe, by rRNA. Next, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognises its pair on the mRNA, like finding your chommie in a veld fire. The amino acids on the tRNA then get bonded to other amino acids, creating a line longer than the N1 traffic. The fun begins with a START codon and keeps going until a STOP codon pops up.	a45f96fb2be9ba1dcc64e6e8fd866c42	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it moves through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is read in triplets known as codons by rRNA and a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA. The process of protein synthesis commences with a START codon in the P site, enabling amino acids to be linked together. This sequence continues, with new matching amino acids added to the tRNA and bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the conclusion of elongation and termination.	b8f771d6598f53e1add6ce5532821e56	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes respective codons on the mRNA, their corresponding amino acids bind together starting from a START codon in the P site. This process continues with new amino acids being added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, signifying the end of protein chain formation.	88de308011a83b1e2439ae20fb5509fa	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore and makes its way into the cytoplasm tae either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, mRNA's bases are read in groups of three - we call these 'codons' - by something called rRNA. Next, there's a bit o' recognition going on as the tRNA, carrying the anticodon that matches up wi' the mRNA's codon, steps up. Following recognition, there's a new amino acid added to the tRNA - it's like building blocks really. These amino acids are bonded together as they're adjacent on different tRNAs. This carry-on keeps happening until there's a STOP codon read on the mRNA in what we call the A site - this brings about elongation and termination.	165c9814fc3945fd14818f74caaa57c9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which then gets read by rRNA in triplets known as codons.

5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA's bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA - starting with a START codon in the P site (initiation), after which amino acids are linked together to form the protein. The tRNA carrying the anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon then recognizes this codon, and an appropriate amino acid is added to it. Finally, the amino acids carried by the tRNA are bonded together, completing the creation of the protein.	78c2f0a4f73c9ed2e7e29467abe3f984	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, travelling through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are read in triplets, referred to as codons, by rRNA and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the relevant mRNA codon. This initiates the process of amino acid bonding, starting with a START codon in the P site and continuing until a STOP codon is detected in the A site. The corresponding amino acids on each tRNA bond to build the protein sequence during this process of initiation, elongation, and termination.	075fc169b7ee8e0969806a16595e530a	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA making a swift exit out of the nucleus like a hare being chased, it nips through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. With codons being read by rRNA in sets of three, tRNA is bang on matching these with anticodons while adding new corresponding amino acids, which are bonded together until a stop sign, or codon, appears and ends the process - all as rare and precise as hen's teeth.	6e0d277fb4f6ac8328649a54296889c9	-1	-1
5	Well, the whole shebang starts when that there mRNA scoots on out the nucleus through a nuclear pore, faster than a hot knife through butter. It then hitches a ride through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or moseys on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, this is where it gets as tricky as a bucket of minnows. Them tRNA fellers, carrying the complementing anticodon (U=A, C+G), come along and recognize the matching codon on the mRNA. The mRNA bases are read off in triplets called codons, by rRNA. It's like calling square dance moves, one after another. Then a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA and these little guys get strung together like beads on a string to make a protein, all starting with a START codon in what they call the P site. And finally, these linked amino acids on the other side of the tRNA are bonded to their next-door neighbor’s amino acids. Sounds like a hard row to hoe, but that's how proteins get made down here at the cellular level.	fbfb0bce005c6cb5081ea519d4f77f1e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplic reticulum. The mRNA's bases, read in triplets called codons by rRNA, are recognized by tRNA that carries the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G). The synthesis initiates at a START codon in the P site, where corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bond together to form a protein chain. This chain continues elongating until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination of the protein synthesis.	e806602e7fdc62ef46763d72765211e9	-1	-1

There, its bases are read by rRNA in triplets known as codons, starting with a START codon in the P site of the ribosome, indicating the initiation of protein synthesis. Following this, tRNA transports corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, where they are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a growing polypeptide chain; this process is continued during elongation. The sequence of adding new amino acids to the growing protein chain continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site of the ribosome, marking termination and resulting in a newly synthesized protein.	b7d4cbe1cc29386ca3a18388c5384935	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis gets going once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, trekking its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA and we got tRNA lugging along the corresponding amino acid, recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA using its anticodon. Off to a start with a START codon in the P site, amino acids start linking up to craft that protein. This keeps on going until they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site - that's when we know it's done and dusted. A new amino acid is then added to tRNA, ready for another round.	75c87779eba73d4de261dc5fd883d084	-1	-1
5	Kickin' aff wi' mRNA scootin' oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it then trails through the cytoplasm tae reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As soon as a START codon in the P site is spotted, amino acids are joined together to get us started on creating a protein - it's like buildin' a house fi' scratch! Then along comes the trusty tRNA, carryin' the complementary anticodon an' recognising its match in the mRNA codon. This leads tae a new corresponding amino acid bein' added to the tRNA, like addin' another brick to our hoose. As this process carries on, amino acids on the other end of each tRNA get bonded wi' one another, 'till finally we reach a STOP codon read on the mRNA in the A site. This marks the end of the journey, where all these linked amino acids now make up a full-blown protein - job's done!	b348e8e0a2b8ad08e112375f2bf87cc3	-1	-1

This sequence of events continues with subsequent amino acids being linked together by bonding to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, and this elongation phase persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is reached prompting termination, thus completing the protein chain.	41d27cb4bf3ebbe09967b83e9b82a0fe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and navigating to either the ribosome or the rough endoploplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Once there, the process of translation initiates as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA codons, which are groups of three bases, starting from a START codon situated in the P site. Transfer RNA (tRNA) identifies each complementary codon on the mRNA by carrying an equivalent anticodon; this guides the placement of corresponding amino acids that are attached at the other end of the tRNA molecule. These amino acids are linked together in a chain, creating a growing protein strand, with each new corresponding amino acid added to the chain until it's complete.	fc229c17ab3dd0f204004e58a0af7d56	-1	-1

Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA, which allows it to add a new amino acid to its chain. The process continues with the linking of these amino acids that starts from a START codon and goes on till a STOP codon is reached in the A site, resulting in the formation of a protein. It's important to note that the adjacent amino acids on each tRNA get bonded together during this process for proper protein formation.	0f4dc5a67b20a300923b3fa7780f9be8	-1	-1

Next up, amino acids start to get linked together to make a protein, kickin' off with a START codon in the P site - this part we call initiation. This process keeps rollin' until a STOP codon gets read on the mRNA in the A site - this is elongation and termination.

As this process keeps on goin', these amino acids get linked thegither, startin' wi' a START codon in the P site (that's yer initiation), an' they dinnae stop until a STOP codon pops up on th' mRNA in the A site - that's whit we call elongation an' termination. An' there ye hae it, all these steps join forces tae create yon protein.	375e7216933e9f2ecd0ff8dfc8658f34	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeys through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, its bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. Our next player is tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon which identifies the corresponding mRNA codon. This triggers addition of a new amino acid to the tRNA that matches the codon and hence, creation of series of bonded amino acids commences. The assembly line doesn't stop until a STOP codon on mRNA in the A site is read, marking the end of protein synthesis (elongation and termination).	c389d0e7e619fb6a5f3c505e8f331284	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic instructions into the cytoplasm. Here, the mRNA encounters a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it initiates protein synthesis at a START codon. The tRNA molecules, which have complementary anticodons, recognize and bind to each mRNA codon in sequence, and their associated amino acids are linked together to form the growing polypeptide chain. This fascinating process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling the termination of protein synthesis. Finally, the newly formed protein detaches from the ribosome - ready to perform its specialized function within or outside the cell!	c0c6af5936a53bd45a8a59a2b3458e13	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex process involving several steps. Step one: The mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Step two: mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Step three: tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA, followed by the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. Step four: Amino acids are linked together to form a protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site (initiation). The linking continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking termination of elongation and completion of protein synthesis.	aac7caee8f606f2d391a1f509785bcca	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's start with the mRNA darting out of the nucleus as fast as greased lightning through a nuclear pore, right into the arms of a ribosome or even into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's like a coded message read in triplets, these are known as codons, and each triplet is recognised by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. Now, it's not all on the never never, each tRNA has an amino acid waiting patiently at its other end. These amino acids link up in a chain when their tRNAs recognise the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This chain grows longer and longer, wet as an otter's pocket until a STOP codon shows up in the A site on the mRNA. Once that happens, like a well-timed final curtain drop, it's all over but for the applause. And there you have it - protein synthesis in four major steps. Ain't science grand?	78585046d3bf2c52aebd9ef2aaf7d537	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon the synthesis of proteins is as fascinating as a coonhound chasing a raccoon up a tree. So here's how it goes down: First off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus via a nuclear pore faster than greased lightning. Then this mRNA, smart as a whip, high tails it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or makes a beeline for the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Meanwhile, our buddy tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA like a good bloodhound on a scent trail. Now we start with initiation where amino acids are hitched together beginning with a START codon in the P site. Then y'all add another corresponding amino acid to the tRNA and bond these amino acids on the far end of the tRNA to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This linking up of amino acids keeps going until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - that's your elongation and termination steps. It's slower than molasses in January but I'll be darned if it ain't important!	ba3cb1c7b5552cdf4b9c56e26b653f27	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then involves a tRNA carrying a corresponding amino acid recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA, after which these amino acids are linked starting from a START codon and continuing until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA. This results in the creation of a protein.	a6eb76fbfb43477d5e858e735ab96b0d	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA exit nucleus through nuclear pore and journey to the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA bases are read in groups of three called codons by rRNA. Next step is where tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. Finally, corresponding amino acids on other end of tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids to form protein starting with a START codon in P site and continue until a STOP codon is read on mRNA in A site.	16ecd568aa0a419b0498bd393faa1764	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore and traveling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases, read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, initiate the process by reading a START codon in the P site, prompting amino acids to start linking together to construct a protein. As each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, it bonds with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, continuing this elongation until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination. Thus, through this intricate sequence of initiation, elongation, and termination, proteins are synthesized.	f05e73fd3eedf96788f4132b52b7f55b	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, tRNA carries the matching anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. This is followed by reading of mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA and addition of a new amino acid to the tRNA. Finally, these amino acids are connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the end of elongation and protein synthesis.	e14ecd4925f6c06755047a2d0640e0bf	-1	-1
5	Well now, ain't this a hoot? So, after mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus, it high-tails it through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. That's where this tRNA fella, carrying its own anticodon that matches up with the mRNA's codon kinda like two peas in a pod, steps in. The tRNA's got an amino acid hitchin' a ride, and when it spots its matching codon on the mRNA, they bond right there on the spot! This whole process keeps on going, adding one amino acid after the other, just like a freight train chuggin' along until it hits a stop sign—that'd be your STOP codon. When that happens, the protein synthesis wraps up and calls it a day.	980a876853d9c6c62836626bba33c933	-1	-1
5	Startin' wi' mRNA bouncin' oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys across the cytoplasm tae either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, carryin' the anti-codon that's a match made in heaven wi' the mRNA's codon, lashes ontae it, meanin' a new amino acid is added tae the growin' protein chain. This chain keep gettin' bigger an' bigger, startin’ wi’ a START codon in the P site until a STOP codon rears its heid in the A site an' tells us tae halt - that's initiation, elongation an' termination for ye! Durin’ this whole palaver, each amino acid on the tRNA bonds wi' its neighbour, creatin' a guid sturdy protein.	085ddc237af348de100cb71a8a897d25	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA, carrying genetic data, exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and journeys through the cytoplasm to make contact with a ribosome or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in clusters of three called codons. Following this, transfer RNA (tRNA) clutching the anticodon that is complementary to mRNA's codon, recognises and connects to it. Each tRNA also carries a corresponding amino acid which becomes linked to the adjacent tRNAs' amino acids, forming a chain. This process continues seamlessly until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signalling the end of elongation and protein synthesis.	bffad704506719fccf0c7435f621dd35	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and venturing into the cytoplasm, ultimately finding its way to the ribosome. Here it encounters tRNA molecules, each carrying an amino acid and an anticodon that matches a codon on the mRNA. This is where the real action initiates: The amino acids are linked together starting from a START codon, forming a chain that expands until a STOP codon signals termination. With each new tRNA that pairs up with the mRNA, another corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain. Voila! That’s the remarkable process of protein synthesis for you!	63d43ee611aca887e80b4eae89f7cfc5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, an awe-inspiring process, begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and journeys through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The first major step is initiation: a START codon in the P site of mRNA signals the beginning of protein assembly. Next, tRNA, carrying the anticodon that complements mRNA's codon (U=A, C+G), hops into action. In the third step, elongation and termination, amino acids are added to the growing protein chain until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected. Lastly, amino acids attached to tRNA bond with neighboring tRNA's amino acids, effectively developing a full-fledged protein. Bursting with energy and precision, this complex biological machinery keeps our cells functioning optimally!	f42b1e72278488169ce3939faaad4dcc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions from the DNA, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA bases are read by rRNA in triplets called codons, with each codon attracting a tRNA molecule that carries a complementary anticodon. This process kick-starts when a START codon is recognised in the P site (initiation), after which corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond with amino acids on adjacent tRNAs. The elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site (termination), resulting in a chain of linked amino acids — and voila! You have a protein.	30b212a923492082c620ac746390f81b	-1	-1
5	Awright, let's go through this one, kid. First off, ya mRNA make a beeline outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it takes a trip to the ribosome or gets into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon pops up and recognizes the mRNA's codon - sorta like finding ya best mate at Fenway. Now here's where things get denser than chowda. With a START codon in place, amino acids are strung together to begin making a protein. As we keep going on this wild ride, more and more amino acids are added to the tRNA and bonded with their neighbors. This party don't stop until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in what they call the A site, ending the elongation and termination. So there ya have it! Four major steps of your protein synthesis for ya.	6f7d5d6807b4a763de1fdd25fd1c0836	-1	-1
5	"Alrighty, to explain the journey of protein synthesis, let's start with mRNA saying ""totsiens"" to the nucleus and moving through a nuclear pore into the cytoplasm. It travels either to the ribosome or takes a detour via the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, we've got our tRNA chums that carry complementary anticodons - it's like they're holding up a mirror to the mRNA codons, matching U with A, and C with G. As soon as they spot their matching codon on the mRNA, they snatch up their corresponding amino acid. When the initiation phase begins with a START codon in the P site, we've officially started connecting these amino acids to create our protein. This goes on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and signalling termination. So, throughout this journey, every amino acid that gets added bonds to its neighbour on tRNA. And voila! That's how we make proteins from our mRNA blueprint."	8da945b6dcde7da80386b55fa4162c67	-1	-1
5	Kicking off like a moose on the loose, mRNA bolts from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, zipping towards the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. As steady as a Canuck's resolve, rRNA reads mRNA bases grouped in threes, known as codons, beginning with a START codon in the P site. Now, it's as hot as Toronto in July! tRNA, armed with the complementary anticodon, recognizes its match in the mRNA codon and brings along an amino acid for the ride. Binding tighter than a beaver's dam, these amino acids link up one after another until they encounter a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of this thrilling ride and leaving us with a newly synthesized protein.	5ec5edb86d5a2fdcf4d2c1508a87bbad	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then travels to either a ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. At these sites, the mRNA's bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. The tRNA, carrying anticodons complementary to the mRNA's codons according to base pairing rules (U=A, C=G), recognizes and binds to these codons. With each binding event, corresponding amino acids attached to the tRNA are added and linked together, creating a growing peptide chain. This elongation process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling for termination of protein synthesis.	6141b50973d1f733f3101d5cd3eb047e	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA nips oot the nucleus an journeys tae the ribosome or strolls intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it's read in groups ay three bases called codons by rRNA. Next up is tRNA carryin' the matchin' anticodon identifyin' the complementary codon ay the mRNA, addin' a new corresponding amino acid. This carries on wi' amino acids bein' bonded tae adjacent yins until a STOP codon seen on the mRNA in the A site halts it aw. Finally, these amino acids are strung thegither tae craft a protein startin' wi' a START codon in the P site.	e8ac5301fbb03d2bb25f7054b3329970	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore relocates to the cytoplasm and attaches itself either to ribosomes or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA is read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, a process during which tRNA carrying complementary anticodons identifies corresponding mRNA codons. The amino acids connected to the tRNA molecules are united with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, beginning with a START codon in the P site, marking initiation. This sequence continues, adding new corresponding amino acids to the tRNA, resulting in the creation of a protein chain.	eee0b1bbb51ecae20c959738914cb900	-1	-1

The third step involves transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying the complementary anticodon, identifying the complementary codon of the mRNA and bringing along with it corresponding amino acids. Lastly, these amino acids link together continuously until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination of protein synthesis. Throughout this process, adjacent tRNA's amino acids bond together, ultimately leading to the formation of a complete protein.	21165f2e049030f02c6aad2367ba70d9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying the genetic information from the DNA, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. At the ribosome, the mRNA's codons, read in groups of three by rRNA, are recognised by tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons and the corresponding amino acids. This 'translation' process initiates with a START codon at the P site, followed by elongation where new amino acids are continually added to the growing chain by bonding with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. Once a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, this signals termination and the final protein structure is released; thus completing this phenomenal biological orchestra!	9a5fc75f5764f2275711b286e2da37a7	-1	-1
5	Right then, off we go on this journey, as fast as greased lightning. The mRNA gets the ball rolling by scooting out of the nucleus and heading through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or checking into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is as rare as hen's teeth, it reads its bases in triplets called codons thanks to rRNA. Then we have the tRNA, a quare lad, carrying an amino acid and an anticodon that's a perfect match for the mRNA codon. It's like a jigsaw puzzle!  Now we're cooking with gas! We kick off with a START codon at the P site initiating the process - this is where amino acids are linked together to make a protein. The tRNA doesn't rest on its laurels though, it keeps adding new amino acids until it crosses paths with a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site which signals full stop - a bit like hitting the brakes! Throughout this whole rigmarole, adjacent tRNA’s amino acids are bonding together. And there you have it - we've just gone through the major steps in protein synthesis!	bd1371f0c998411a125e44caf384ccc3	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this a hard row to hoe! So first off, that mRNA skips out the nucleus through a nuclear pore and sets off into the cytoplasm to rendezvous with a ribosome or take a trip into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now pay attention here, partner. The tRNA, toting the complementary anticodon, comes ambling along next to pair up with the mRNA's codon. This is where amino acids enter the picture—each one hitching itself to a fresh tRNA, like riders saddling up their horses for a long trail ride. This chain of riders keeps growing till a STOP codon on the mRNA signals it's time to break camp. So there you have it, pardner: initiation, elongation, and termination—the dance steps of protein synthesis.	db507a9ec93d9856f9d74893230a6bb3	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is the migration of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore into the cytoplasm, where it encounters the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, mRNA's bases are read by rRNA in groups of three, termed as codons. The tRNA, having an anticodon that complements the codon on the mRNA, identifies and binds to it. The corresponding amino acid attached to the other end of the tRNA forms a bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Lastly, new amino acids continue to be added to the chain until a STOP codon on mRNA is detected, signaling the end of elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	e9023b4d6d805091910da009e98f39f3	-1	-1

5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore and traveling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. mRNA bases are then read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, and the initiation of protein creation starts with a START codon in the P site. A tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches the codon on the mRNA recognizes the corresponding codon, leading to amino acids being linked together to form a protein. These amino acids, attached to the other end of the tRNA, bond with the amino acids of adjacent tRNAs while new complementary amino acids are continually added to the chain.	a7021afd33e8de14e588c39630344efc	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it moves to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Within these, mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA, which signals the addition of corresponding amino acids onto tRNA. The protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site (initiation), then amino acids continue to be linked on tRNA until a STOP codon is read in the A site, marking the end of elongation and beginning of termination. Thus, a chain of linked amino acids forms a protein.	23c09db79af5380f9b81e2970cc0b5ad	-1	-1
5	Well, the first step after mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore is that its bases are read in groups of three, sorta like words in a sentence, which we call codons. Then comes along this little guy called tRNA, carryin' an anticodon that matches right up with the mRNA's codon. This tRNA also totes along a new amino acid, ready and rarin' to join the party. Then these amino acids get all buddy-buddy and start bonding together, building up a protein. They keep this hoedown going from the START codon all the way until they hit a STOP one. And there you have it - protein synthesis in a nutshell!	68a3c0ed0dd3eb414d66a5d967711a0d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA heads oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its way tae the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, mRNA bases are read in groups of three, kenned as codons, by rRNA. Next up, the tRNA rockin' the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) clocks the corresponding codon on the mRNA and adds its own corresponding amino acid. This goes on til a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site, causing the amino acids tae be linked up until termination - this process is full-on elongation.	5f1e2c7bb587ba65b3b86cf44422d9a8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins once the mRNA has exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then travels through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The synthesising of proteins starts with a START codon in the P site that initiates the linking of amino acids, facilitated by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon which recognises this codon on the mRNA. This process continually adds new corresponding amino acids to the tRNA which are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, culminating the elongation and termination phases.	e32e4778b80c7eef7c4492f28d939aea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, mRNA bases are read in 'triplets' called codons by rRNA and tRNA carrying the anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, thus facilitating the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. This process of elongation continues with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids bonding together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling termination of protein synthesis.	fae0b2fd0183163cfb3ed2db36e686fb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm or rough endoplic reticulum, guided by ribosomes reading the mRNA's base sequences in triplets called codons. The tRNA, carrying an anticodon that is complimentary to the mRNA's codon, brings along a specific amino acid to add to the protein chain. This process of initiation begins with a START codon and continues (elongation) until a STOP codon is encountered (termination), during which amino acids are continuously linked together. The corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA are bonded together, leading to the formation of a complete protein.	31e4521a3b265dec87475017d7a6629a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and travelling to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The mRNA's codons (groups of three bases) are then read by rRNA, starting from a START codon in the P site, a process known as 'initiation'. Subsequently, tRNAs carrying corresponding anti-codons recognise and bind to the complementary codons of the mRNA, each tRNA also carrying a specific amino acid. This leads to 'elongation', where these amino acids are successively linked together as the mRNA is read, until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signalling 'termination'. These linked amino acids form the resulting protein.	17f3d115385350ecaa627cdd1c4c2480	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first off, the mRNA, it beats it outta the nucleus via somethin' called a nuclear pore. Once it's in the cytoplasm, it high-tails it to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, dependin' on where it needs to go. While that's happenin', there’s this thing called tRNA that’s collectin' amino acids and matchin’ ‘em up with their corresponding mRNA bases, which are read in groups of three, kinda like a combo at Dunkies. This process keeps chuggin’ along till a STOP signal pops up on the mRNA. Throughout all this, amino acids are bein' hooked together by bonds formed between adjacent tRNAs - dense as chowder, huh?	67915258eca56147e61cd12613eb74bb	-1	-1
5	To kick things off, mRNA takes a gamble and leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, navigating through the cytoplasm to pitch up at the ribosome or it can also enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, as if they're queuing for a lekker braai, amino acids start lining up at the START codon in the P site - this is where the protein party gets started (initiation).  Next thing you know, tRNA – carrying anticodons that are like two peas in a pod with the mRNA's codon (remember we're talking U=A, and C+G here) – recognises its matching codon on the mRNA. Each set of three bases on the mRNA, these triplets called codons, get read as if they're today's newspaper headlines (and that's done by rRNA).  On the other side of this tRNA, there are corresponding amino acids that bond together with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids like best mates at a rugby match. This bonding of amino acids carries on, right up until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site – kind of like the ref blowing his whistle for full time (this bit is known as elongation and termination). After this process, proteins are synthesized, ready to play their part in the body. Now that wasn't so tough hey?	4951e3d7ed115e8056049373e533d8e1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, tRNAs carrying anticodons that complement the mRNA's codons are recognized, thanks to rRNA reading mRNA bases in triplets. The protein begins to form as amino acids, linked by corresponding tRNA, are added starting with a START codon in the P site and continue to be added until a STOP codon is read in the A site, leading to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids bonding together.	dc02dccf7a1b3464f4e91a37523238e4	-1	-1
5	Upon leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA travels to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In what we know as initiation, protein synthesis begins when a START codon in the P site triggers the linkage of amino acids. This process continues with tRNA carrying an anticodon that recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, and subsequently adds a new corresponding amino acid. Elongation and termination take place as amino acids are continually linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, during which the corresponding amino acids on the other end of each tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, thus forming a complete protein molecule.	b06a678b7109e8de54feebbb9aa01c25	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it gets read in groups o' three bases cried codons by rRNA. Next, tRNA wi' the right anticodon (that's U for A, an' C wi' G) recognises the matchin' codon on the mRNA, an' adds a new correspondin' amino acid. This gies us oor amino acids that get linked together to make a protein, startin' wi' a START codon at the P site an' keep goin' until they hit a STOP codon at the A site.	4a7c261ac6b8ed9061d4ba87da2f1d09	-1	-1

The protein synthesis initiates at the START codon in the P site which is followed by the elongation phase where new corresponding amino acids are continuously added to the growing peptide chain by tRNA. This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached in the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis, resulting in a newly formed protein.	a413771fbad107fb3b42bc0a4d0716d7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeying to the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. This mRNA, which is read in triplets called codons by rRNA, signals the start of protein creation at a START codon, with amino acids being linked together in a process involving the addition of corresponding amino acids to tRNA and recognition of complementary anticodons, until a STOP codon indicates termination.	7c5e21207c8735038fcfc8320fa331f7	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, its bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding mRNA codon. Following this, a new amino acid is added to the tRNA molecule, starting with a START codon in the P site which signals for protein synthesis initiation. The assemblage of amino acids persists until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, indicating elongation and termination phases of protein synthesis.	dcc55a535b817567da9b4f22b83c965b	-1	-1
5	Bang on then, here's the 'puck' of it. Once mRNA has made the hop out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it takes a wee holiday through the cytoplasm all the way to the ribosome or jumps into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, our friend the mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA and tRNA carries the complementary anticodon that recognizes these codons. Then, just like building blocks, a new corresponding amino acid is added to each tRNA and these are bonded together as solid as the Rock of Cashel. We keep this chain reaction going until a STOP codon shows its face on mRNA in what we call the A site, and that's when we know it's time to wrap things up.	88db69c1f56111e707697a19a234cb2b	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for this brain tussler. The first thing that happens is that mRNA gets itself out of the nucleus through a fancy door called a nuclear pore. Then, it's gotta be read in groups of three bases, or 'codons', by something called rRNA. Alright, now it's time for these corresponding amino acids hitched to the tRNA to bond with their neighbors. They keep on doing this dance, adding a new corresponding amino acid each time. These amino acids are strung together like clothes on a line to make a protein, beginning with what they call a START codon in the P site - not as exciting as starting a BBQ, but it's science for ya. This mRNA then ambles through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum - sounds more complicated than figuring out grandma's cornbread recipe! Finally, these amino acids continue joining hands until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - this part they call elongation and termination.	745e65aeea3a4055fb3f6b49d7675596	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore and moving into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomal RNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets called codons, initiating the process with a START codon in the P site. Subsequent codons are recognized by the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, leading to the addition of corresponding amino acids to the growing protein chain. This elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered, signalling the termination of protein synthesis and the completion of the protein molecule.	72a4d917073b26a82da8435f3bb4539c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rRNA reads the bases on the mRNA in triplets, referred to as codons, and tRNA carrying matching anticodons (where U=A and C=G) recognizes these complementary codons. This process initiates with a START codon in the P site, after which corresponding amino acids on each tRNA are bonded to each other, forming a protein chain. The elongation of this chain continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination of the protein synthesis.	e209c192e2bf6ea510d4c4d1a275897e	-1	-1
5	Upon leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once at the ribosome, tRNA carrying the anticodon complementary to mRNA's codon, recognizes and binds to it. The process continues with mRNA bases being read in triplets, known as codons by rRNA which leads to the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bonding to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids and new corresponding amino acids being added to the tRNA. This sequence of linking amino acids proceeds until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the elongation and termination phases of protein synthesis.	02059dd248ec18d972a13a1295ce5072	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it journeys through the cytoplasm and either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or approaches a ribosome. Its bases are then read in groups of three, known as codons. The tRNA, carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon, identifies the mRNA's complementary codon and attaches a new corresponding amino acid. The process continues with these amino acids being linked to form a protein starting with a START codon in the P site, and continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.	b43ee17072be0dc169a33d1030ac9e63	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, so here's the lowdown on protein synthesis. After mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus, it moseys on through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum - kinda like heading to the general store for supplies. Then, tRNA, carrying the opposite (U=A, C+G) anticodon, recognizes its matching codon on the mRNA, sorta like recognizing your cousin at a family reunion. The mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons (by rRNA), which is a bit like reading a recipe in a cookbook. Starting with a START codon in the P site (initiation), amino acids are linked together to whip up a protein just like linked sausages. As each corresponding amino acid gets bonded to its neighbor on the tRNA, a new one is added - kinda like adding logs to a woodpile. This process keeps chugging along until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination), putting an end to things like calling it quits after a long day of work. That's how proteins get synthesized!	0523b29f51345c1ec8664b280ca0d372	-1	-1
5	Oan its journey frae the nucleus, mRNA pops oot via a nuclear pore and either heads tae the ribosome or scoots intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. RRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons while tRNA, carryin’ the complementary anticodon, recognises these codons and drags along a new corresponding amino acid. These amino acids keep getting connected until they hit upon a STOP codon on the mRNA, signalin' the end of the assembly line. This process of linking and stopping is called elongation and termination, resulting in a brand-new protein.	a7e59e47b11d9ef32c7793df875c3e5b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex process initiated by the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and moving into the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It then associates with ribosomes where it's bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Subsequently, tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon recognises and binds to the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This marks the beginning of protein formation as amino acids are sequentially added to the growing chain, commencing with a START codon in the P site. The elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signalling termination. A new amino acid is attached to each tRNA during this process, effectively translating mRNA sequences into functional proteins.	efe6b544c3216b2cd97516bd408423b2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons by rRNA, initiating with a START codon in the P site, from which amino acids are assembled to form a protein until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. Meanwhile, each tRNA molecule brings in a new corresponding amino acid that bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, continuing this process of elongation and termination until completion.	680b97a901c0030ac01cbfe948a2b51f	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum. The mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA and a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This leads to the initiation phase where amino acids start getting linked, starting from a START codon in the P site. The chain of amino acids continues to grow (elongation phase) until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (termination phase), resulting in protein synthesis. With each new codon read, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.	848dc2d54c3eb96c0aa3bd675ed4bd21	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA, leading to the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. Consequently, these amino acids are linked together commencing with a START codon in the P site, a process known as initiation. Elongation then occurs, linking amino acids together until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, resulting in termination. The corresponding amino acids on the other end of each tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, ultimately creating a protein.	225fd7e94ecbbd196c9f1cf18d1ed54f	-1	-1
5	"Alright, so check this out: Protein synthesis get goin' when mRNA says bye to the nucleus through a nuclear pore and goes gallivanting to the ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here where it gets read in three-part harmony like a triple-scoop ice cream cone from JP Licks (that's codons for ya). Then, y'know that amino acid attached to the tRNA? It gets added on, and then we're off to the races with a non-stop linking party of amino acids kickstarted by a START codon all cozy-like in the P site. This keeps going, each new amino acid bonding with its neighbor, like Red Sox fans in Fenway after a home run. The whole shebang carries on till a STOP codon pulls up in the A site. And just like that, you got yourself a protein synthesized, faster than you can say ""Bunker Hill."""	24cec794511b57b02123e597347e5901	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, unfolds in four primary steps. Once in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, codons (groups of three mRNA bases) are read by rRNA in the ribosome during a process called initiation; here, a START codon is identified in the P site. The tRNA then recognises and bonds with its complementary mRNA codon based on the U=A, C+G rule, carrying a new corresponding amino acid. Lastly, this amino acid links to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, slowly but surely building up the protein molecule like bricks in a wall.	e8c77983f8724071f55ac8ea497818df	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis starts off. This mRNA then journeys through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of initiation kicks off when a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA, starting with a START codon in the P site. The tRNA now adds a new amino acid to its sequence, and neighbouring amino acids on other tRNA molecules are bonded together, forming a chain or protein. This elongation continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling termination and completing the process of protein synthesis.	b1e0c4bcce9794515ddb66dbc2d15d29	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as the mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum, carrying genetic information encoded in codons, or groups of three bases. This is recognized by tRNA molecules that carry corresponding anticodons and attached amino acids; these begin to build a protein chain through a process initiated at a START codon, continued through elongation of this chain, and terminated upon reaching a STOP codon.	4cd68e258ca702299d4f31e3ad868a31	-1	-1
5	Firsly, mRNA gies oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore an' scoots intae the cytoplasm richt tae the ribosome or th' rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's then read in trios called codons bi rRNA whiles tRNA cairryin' the complementary anticodon spots the matchin' codon o' the mRNA. Noo begins the protein makin', wi' amino acids bein' tied thegither startin' wi' a START codon in th' P site, an' this keeps gaun till a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. Atween times, these amino acids oan different ends o’ tRNA are bonded tae yin anither alangside t’wa.	c81b549204fcedb8ce9e92dd4c6a1f4b	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA moving from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, before associating with ribosomes. In a series of stages known as initiation, elongation, and termination, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads mRNA's codons in sets of three bases, tRNA recognizes corresponding anticodons via complementary base pairing (U=A, C=G), and links the specific amino acids present on its other end to form a protein chain. The commencement of this sequence is signaled by a START codon in the P site and it continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site.	c84ee5f9502dec5911aeedfa995f3079	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA, encoded with genetic information, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the process. It then proceeds to the ribosome where its bases, grouped into triplets called codons, are identified and matched by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons. A corresponding amino acid is attached to each tRNA, and these acids are subsequently bonded together in a process of elongation, starting with a START codon at the P site. This construction of amino acid chains continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA within the A site, marking termination and thus, the creation of a protein.	bba6f10fc52bfd99dfb2ce26ec28a7c5	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA bases being read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. A key step involves tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA, leading to the linking of corresponding amino acids on both ends of the tRNA to its adjacent counterparts. This sequence of amino acids extends from a START codon in the P site until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, resulting in the formation of a protein chain.	715b98bbd67972768f62693b667a2c64	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, protein synthesis is a quare dance between molecules! First off, our mRNA, as wet as an otter's pocket with genetic information, scuttles out of the nucleus and hitches a ride on a ribosome. Like a debutante at her first ball, the mRNA awaits the dashing tRNA to recognise its codons and add the corresponding amino acid. This process goes arseways till they hit upon a STOP codon - the end of their whirlwind waltz!	18b920e090e0589dfe2f986b6e6809ad	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, this ain't as complex as finding a needle in a haystack. mRNA exits the nucleus quicker than a hiccup, then travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome. It's got these triplets called codons that are read by rRNA, kinda like how we read our grandma's recipes. tRNA, cute as a button, comes along carrying the complementary anticodon and recognizes the correct mRNA codon. After hitching a ride on tRNA, amino acids get linked together starting with a START codon in the P site - it's like building a porch, one plank at a time. They keep on linking until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA. There you have it - protein synthesis in four steps, concise as cornbread!	a334d82daeeaef8cf6acc9902588b046	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome. Here, the mRNA is read in triplets called codons by rRNA and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. Then, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, and this process continues with new corresponding amino acids being added until a protein is formed. The process begins with a START codon in the P site and may also involve entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	491ed33ea68a9c351f6327889f96dec4	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA exit nucleus through nuclear pore, it then travel cross cytoplasm to ribosome or go inside rough endoplasmic reticulum.

This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, signaling termination of protein synthesis.	9d1c48f034e30d2526cc90ecb301df28	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon, and the corresponding amino acid on the tRNA is bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acid. This process of linking amino acids starts with a START codon in the P site (initiation), and continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination), resulting in a protein. Every time an amino acid is added, a new corresponding amino acid is also added to the tRNA.	e94f203e9950dc7263d54e491acba76c	-1	-1
5	Well first off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Next up, that tiny traveler, mRNA, hightails it to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While there, tRNA, with its trusty anticodon, matches up with the complementary codon on our mRNA friend. Then they're reading those mRNA bases in triplets called codons and adding on new corresponding amino acids to the tRNA like stacking up flapjacks at a Sunday breakfast. Finally, these hitchhiking amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get bonded together with their neighbors, and just like that, you've got yourself a protein.	1d5e8a29409c1274a7e06dae7496799a	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA buggers off from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, heading to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Next, the mRNA bases get read in groups of three, which we call codons by rRNA, and tRNA swoops in with its anticodon matching up to each codon on the mRNA. Then, starting with a START codon at the P site, amino acids start sticking together like old pals at the pub to form a protein chain. They keep going until they bump into a STOP codon at the A site, this signals them to stop adding more amino acids. Finally, these amino acids on each tRNA get bonded together, kinda like a firm handshake between mates. So there ye have it, from start to finish, that's how proteins get made!	ed294074b9990b09835a9563b3e58788	-1	-1

Now, the show begins! rRNA read the mRNA bases in groups of three, we call them codons. Like how we recognize our family at a big reunion, tRNA with the complementary anticodon recognizes its corresponding mRNA codon. Now this is where things get sweet! A new amino acid is added to the tRNA - each one fitting together like pieces in a puzzle. The amino acids on the tRNA are bonded to the neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, and this continues till a STOP codon is read on the mRNA - that's when we know the party done! This whole process is what we call elongation and termination. So you see, from nucleus to cytoplasm, this journey brings about new proteins through some amazing steps!	186036b681a1729d5fdff5c87919a384	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and migrating to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, the mRNA's base triplets, known as codons, are identified by rRNA, initiating protein production with a START codon in the P site. This process continues as tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons, recognizes corresponding mRNA codons, allowing its linked amino acids to be bonded together with adjacent ones carried by other tRNAs. The elongation of this sequence persists until a STOP codon is detected on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the termination of protein synthesis.	9be4ec4a428274755344e90167c7a20d	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it travels into the cytoplasm where it's read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. It attaches to the ribosome at a START codon in the P site, triggering the process of protein synthesis, known as initiation. In the next stage called elongation, new amino acids are continuously added to corresponding tRNA and then bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The cycle keeps going until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, signaling termination, and the assembled chain of amino acids forms a protein.	3740d3544acd1acbafac9d634000eae3	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's the lowdown on protein synthesis. Once the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, it makes its way to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. This mRNA has a message in triplets called codons that rRNA reads like Sunday paper. Now tRNA comes into play carrying anticodons that match up with these codons like two sides of a zipper. Then each tRNA adds a new amino acid to the growing chain, building that protein like bricks in a wall, starting at what's called a START codon in the P site. This keeps rolling until they hit a STOP codon in the A site. By that point, all them amino acids have bonded together to make one heck of a protein!	62d63b496cca4a5714d151c6f8503ffb	-1	-1
5	Let's kick aff wi' mRNA sayin' cheerio to the nucleus through the nuclear pore, richt? It's off like a balloon to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up we've got codons - they're like wee groups of three bases on the mRNA, and they get read by rRNA. Now here's where it gets exciting! Every time a codon is read, a new amino acid is added to the tRNA, kind of like adding sprouts to yer Christmas dinner. This is all thanks to the tRNA having the perfect matching 'anticodon', like finding your other half in a ceilidh. We start with a START codon in the P site, and keep jigging away, adding more and more amino acids until we hit a STOP codon in the A site. When this happens, it's game over – no more amino acids are added and we've got ourselves a fully formed protein. Magic!	e4ac9fb27f2433ea6cc22008b0567248	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to meet up with the ribosome or even enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next major step involves the tRNA, which carries the complementary anticodon, recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA and subsequently adding a corresponding amino acid. Then awaits the exciting process of initiation, where amino acids are linked together to construct a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site. This process continues with elongation and termination until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, during which the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	cdd9d5e6a6adc27a9c86741bee008fe6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and migrates into the cytoplasm, heading either to a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. tRNA with a complementary anticodon identifies the mRNA's matching codon and attaches to it, this occurs within the ribosomes where mRNA's bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Then, amino acids are linked together into a protein chain starting with a START codon at the P site; this process is called initiation. The elongation phase continues this chain-building until it reaches a STOP codon in the A site, terminating the protein synthesis. Each tRNA then replenishes itself with a new corresponding amino acid to repeat the process.	d9488035d011b721e1ca5199ae8355ed	-1	-1
5	The exhilarating journey of protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels either to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, initiating protein synthesis by bonding with a START codon in the ribosome's P site. This event triggers a chain reaction where corresponding amino acids on each tRNA are connected together, and as new tRNA with matching amino acid comes in, it continues to add to this growing chain. The process goes on, linking amino acids one after another until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of this stage and creating a full-fledged protein!	a91de5b7bc9604b0ec205f43296c1051	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, travels to the ribosomes found in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA, setting off the process of initiation with a START codon at the P site. Then comes tRNA carrying anticodons that match up with the mRNA's codons as per the base pairing rules (U pairs with A and C pairs with G). This results in the relevant amino acids, attached to another end of the tRNA, being bonded together. The elongation phase thus continues until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, bringing about termination. These linked amino acids form a protein – it's remarkable how these complex yet precise interactions result in such fundamental structures for life!	eaa3aa7ac24f5862ef914e108a23306c	-1	-1
5	Aight, here's how it goes down. First off, mRNA, faster than a car on the Pike, zips outta the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore and makes its way to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Once there, each triplet of mRNA bases, known as codons, is read by rRNA - this process is slower than molasses in January but crucial! Now comes the tRNA carrying the matching anticodon which recognizes the complementary codon on the mRNA. From there, we kick things off with a START codon in the P site that signals where to start linking amino acids together to create a protein. This part's stronger than a Southie dockworker! We keep adding these corresponding amino acids onto the tRNA until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA at the A site - that's how you know it's game over for this round of protein synthesis.	17264b0dc71eafdc1262b42ea8cd17ae	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA takes a journey from the nucleus through the nuclear pore like a postman delivering a letter, it travels through the cytoplasm to its final destination - the ribosome or maybe takes a detour through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At this point, rRNA comes into the game reading the bases of the mRNA in triplets, much like decoding a secret message, these are known as codons. Now here's where the real magic happens: amino acids are linked together to create a protein, this process kicks off with a START codon at the P site - kinda like lighting the braai. We continue adding new corresponding amino acids to tRNA, just like adding wood to keep the fire going until we reach a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site - that's when you know your steak is ready. All these steps are crucial in protein synthesis, the process is as meticulous and detailed as building a puzzle.	a61bae52ca216f3f44e00cd71083003c	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus like a Toronto Maple Leaf on a breakaway, using a nuclear pore as its rink exit. Then it's game time in the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum, where the tRNA steps in, steady as a Canuck's resolve. This player carries an anticodon that matches up with the mRNA's codon, following the rule-book - U=A and C=G. It's like passing a puck - the tRNA also brings along an amino acid which gets linked to the growing protein chain. The play continues solid as Canadian Shield, with amino acids being added continuously until coming face-to-face with a stop codon, signaling the end of the period or protein synthesis process.	5b7da8ed8375fc73d84b000280a9e961	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or gets incorporated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons. tRNA molecules, each bearing an anticodon complementary to an mRNA codon, come into play, carrying corresponding amino acids. As these tRNA molecules recognize their complementary mRNA codons, their attached amino acids bond with those on adjacent tRNAs. This amino acid chain continues to grow until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, signaling the end of protein synthesis. This complex yet fascinating process ensures that our bodies have the proteins they need to function correctly!	9848bfdd80615cf431c2e69f9eef865e	-1	-1
5	Aye, the business o' protein synthesis is a grand journey, ye ken! The mRNA, strong as a lion, leaves the nucleus through a wee nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or gets itself into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we hae the tRNA with its anticodon that's as canny as they come - recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA, and on its other end it carries an amino acid. It's just like when mony a mickle maks a muckle, ye ken; each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, they bond together starting wi' a START codon in the P site until they meet a STOP codon in the A site. This way, round as a pease, the chain o' amino acids makes up the protein.	0ea34965bc0a88d90f73e6ab6ac27650	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through the nuclear pore, the first step in protein synthesis unfolds; this involves reading the mRNA bases in triplets called codons with the help of rRNA. Then, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognizes and binds to its complementary mRNA codon, leading to an addition of a corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. This process continues during the elongation phase and amino acids are successively linked together starting from a START codon and ending at a STOP codon, resulting in the formation of protein! Isn't it just fascinating how these microscopic interactions result in life as we know it?	008f57bdfa281249ae52c00adbc1503d	-1	-1
5	Starting with the voyage of mRNA out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the journey of protein synthesis begins. It either heads to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm where the mRNA bases are read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. A tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon identifies its corresponding mRNA codon, leading to an attachment of amino acids present at one end of the tRNA to the amino acids of the adjacent tRNA. This sequence of bonding continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signifying the initiation and elongation phases, and finally resulting in termination, thus culminating in the creation of a new protein.	890f094bababc31e2c1512e5b2780cce	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis post mRNA leaving the nucleus comprises of several major steps. Firstly, the mRNA travels through the cytoplasm and either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or attaches to a ribosome, where its bases, read in triplets called codons by rRNA, signal the initiation of protein creation with a START codon present in the P site. Subsequently, tRNAs carrying specific anticodons recognise and bind to each successive complementary codon of the mRNA, transporting corresponding amino acids which get linked together in a growing chain. This elongation process continues until the mRNA presents a STOP codon in the A-site, marking the termination point of protein synthesis.	9afa3bf9cf82d376001cb66a28dad006	-1	-1
5	Sure, so when mRNA, as elusive as hen's teeth, manages to leave the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's bang on ready for protein synthesis. Starting with initiation, where amino acids are linked together beginning with a START codon in the necessary P site. Our mRNA bases are then meticulously read in batches of three, known as codons, by our ever-attentive rRNA. The tRNA, as reliable as the Rock of Cashel, carries in its pocket the complementary anticodon which recognises each complementary codon of the mRNA. A fresh and eager amino acid is added to the growing tRNA chain. Our mRNA then travels through the cytoplasm making its way to either a ribosome or taking a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, like an intricate dance, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to their adjacent tRNA’s amino acids et voila! A protein is synthesised.	1e055834a22f2695cce39aeb91904053	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's break it down. This whole dance starts off when that mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus through a lil' door called a nuclear pore, trekkin' all the way to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where things get interesting, this mRNA's got a message coded in groups of three bases — them's what we call 'codons', and they're read loud and clear by rRNA. Next up, a tRNA comes along carryin' an anticodon that's right as rain for matchin' up with the mRNA's codon. Once they're paired up like two peas in a pod, a new amino acid gets added to this tRNA. This goes on and on till we hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site, that's when we know it's time to quit. So, we've begun with a START codon in the P site (that's what we call initiation), kept addin' amino acids till we can't no more (elongation), and then wrapped it all up at that STOP codon (termination). When all's said and done, those linked amino acids make up one heck of a protein. Now ain't that somethin'?	506710200d9f08f85ecaaa852a63d1bc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore into the cytoplasm, where it either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or joins with a ribosome. Following this, the mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, while tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the corresponding codon of the mRNA. This leads to the bonding of amino acids located at one end of the tRNA to adjacent tRNA's amino acids in a process that continues until a stop codon is read on the mRNA, signaling an end to the elongation and termination stages. Lastly, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, completing the protein synthesis process.	1c4997f67b552857b4f2d96aa6449b15	-1	-1
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it initiates protein synthesis by having its bases read in triplets or codons. These codons are recognized by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons and each corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. A chain of these amino acids forms starting with a START codon until a STOP codon is reached, creating the protein.	affbb6e5098d4a09e54d972787185df3	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Through a mechanism known as initiation, amino acids are linked starting with a START codon in the P site on the mRNA, which is read in triplets called codons by rRNA. A corresponding amino acid is then added to each tRNA molecule, and these amino acids on one end of the tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This sequence continues until a STOP codon is read in the A site on the mRNA, marking the end of elongation and beginning of termination, thus finalizing protein synthesis.	786eab50ebffce8be43df293e934b922	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and moves to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Next, protein synthesis starts with a START codon in the P site, with mRNA bases read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Then, tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon brings a new amino acid. Finally, adjacent amino acids on different tRNAs bond together, gradually forming a protein.	bce252b9e2697c43e6305fba9edd79af	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the skinny on protein synthesis. First off, that mRNA is up and at 'em out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and it either heads to the ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons, by the rRNA. A tRNA molecule comes along with an anticodon that matches right up with the mRNA's codon - kind of like finding your tractor's key after losing it in a hay field. That there tRNA also carries a new amino acid to add to the chain. This process of matching up codons and anticodons keeps going just finer than frog hair, with new amino acids joining the party until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA. This is when our newly minted protein is ready to head out and do its job. And that, my friend, is colder than a witch's teat in a brass bra!	63170b38e73fae9de2bdd9d80f7de295	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA, heavy as a lead balloon wi' information, sneaks out the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it’s all eyes on the rRNA that deciphers the mRNA's codons in sets of three. Now, imagine tRNA as a wee translator carrying the counter part of mRNA’s codon and fetches new amino acids. These amino acids are then strung together like beads on a necklace during initiation at the START codon, continuing until they hit a STOP sign (codon), causing elongation and termination. So, nae wind, nae wave, ye've got yerself a protein! Remember though, any mess up here and it's mince!	6db6e26ece71b334ad0bdfbbb8926ef4	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves various major steps. Initially, the mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA and this process begins with a START codon in the P site (initiation). Next, transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA and links a corresponding new amino acid to the tRNA. The process continues with amino acids being linked together to form a protein, and these corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Lastly, this sequence of linking amino acids carries on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site which signals the termination of protein synthesis (elongation and termination).	9e3835fe3f8e7ba5b4f727e7d13a5a13	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, rRNA reads the mRNA's bases in triplets or codons and tRNA with complementary anticodons recognize these codons, leading to the initiation of protein synthesis at the START codon in the P site. The process of elongation continues with amino acids being linked together by peptide bonds until a STOP codon is read at the A site, marking termination. Throughout this process, each tRNA brings a new corresponding amino acid which gets bonded to an adjacent one on the growing protein chain.	6c892b4db720d6ac22c2d1289c54faec	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the mRNA's bases are read in triplets, known as codons by rRNA.

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, travelling through the cytoplasm to a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, with protein generation commencing at a START codon situated in the P site (initiation stage). This process continues with new corresponding amino acids being added to the tRNA and then bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The synthesis of protein carries on with amino acids continually being linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the elongation and termination stages.	a051005f11d2373a400cf4a3807c0c97	-1	-1
5	Awright, let's break it down like a Sox game. Fuhst off, aftah that mRNA slips outta the nucleus through the nuclear pore slicker than a clam at high tide, it gets read in triplets by rRNA, yeah? These triples are called codons. Now here's where it gets exciting, more thrilling than a Patriots comeback in the fourth quarter: when tRNA carries over the complementary anticodon, recognizing the matching codon on that mRNA. Each tRNA comes with a brand-spankin' new amino acid. One by one, these amino acids get linked togethah, starting with a START codon in the P site and keep addin' on 'til they hit a STOP codon. Just like how we pack Fenway till it’s bustin', these corresponding amino acids bond together to form a protein. And there you have it! It's initiation, elongation, and termination of protein synthesis all in one play!	7af5d5609791ffc42d2f04bf4ae14af1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, high as the Drakensberg in cellular processes, kicks off when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels quick-quick, like a veld fire, to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, the mRNA's bases are read in groups of three called codons by rRNA. Up next, tRNA carries the complementary anticodon that recognises each codon of the mRNA and a new corresponding amino acid is added, almost as if it's building a braai. The game changes when a START codon is read in the P site - this marks the beginning of the protein chain (initiation). Amino acids are strung together like beads on a necklace until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site bringing elongation and termination into play. And voila! You have your protein.	84b2f9104e481b2a1a82467c0eb2886a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off as mRNA, carrying the genetic code, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During initiation, rRNA starts reading the mRNA bases in clusters of three, known as codons, commencing from a START codon. Each codon is identified by tRNA carrying the opposing anticodon (U=A, C+G), which bonds its corresponding amino acid to adjacent ones on other tRNA molecules. This elongation process persists until a STOP codon gets read on the mRNA, finishing the creation of the protein chain.	9d48926fbbdbbb22139580868a5794be	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic code in the form of codons, which are triplets of bases.

5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, moving on to the ribosomes where its bases are read in sets of three known as codons by rRNA. A tRNA carrying an anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon recognizes this complementary pair, adding a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, and this process continues with adjacent tRNAs' amino acids bonding together from a START codon until they reach a STOP codon, creating a linked chain of amino acids that forms the protein (initiation, elongation, and termination).	7e1504ac98bb03f520f45dc99b32ef40	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA departing from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or infiltrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then involves mRNA bases being interpreted in codon triplets by rRNA while tRNA, bearing complementary anticodons (U=A, C=G), acknowledges their respective mRNA codons and adds a new matching amino acid, subsequently binding these amino acids to those on adjacent tRNA molecules. This sequence of amino acid linking persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the termination of elongation and thus concluding protein synthesis.	618eaa3ba8cd4362c0cec918b235e972	-1	-1

Within the ribosome (where rRNA is found), protein synthesis initiates at the START codon on the mRNA, with tRNA recognising and binding to its complementary codon. Amino acids are linked together in a sequence determined by these codons, with new corresponding amino acids continually added until a STOP codon is encountered, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	2244282bafded543d0a3604fb52833cb	-1	-1
5	First off, our mRNA fella does a bit of a moonlight flit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carting along info for protein creation. Then it's off to the races, either making its merry way towards the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. That's when things get quare interesting - the tRNA holding the complementary anticodon gets all chummy with the mRNA's codon. It's like a matching game, U linking arms with A, C paired off with G. Now, these codons are in trios, mind you. As this party continues, new amino acids get added to the growing chain on our tRNA mate. This carry-on keeps up until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site and brings everything arseways; that's our cue for elongation and termination. Finally, adjacent tRNA's amino acids are puck together to form one solid protein chain.	54608999323530637f1a6c997fbf8807	-1	-1

Now, it's got these groups of three bases, y'all know 'em as codons, and they're read by rRNA. This here tRNA feller carries the anticodon matching up with the mRNA's codon -- it's kind of like finding your dance partner at a hoedown. Then we start hooking up amino acids from one tRNA to its neighbor, sorta like stringing popcorn for the Christmas tree. They keep this dance going until they stumble across a STOP codon on the mRNA. And there you have it!	bef17fc588508b7eb0f8491a2e5a29a4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues as mRNA's codons are recognized by corresponding tRNA anticodons, which carry specific amino acids. These amino acids are linked together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site and ending with a STOP codon in the A site.	2eb677cdb509747a805b29cdc33f7fa7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus involve four major steps. Firstly, mRNA exit the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travel in the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enter rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognize the complementary codon of the mRNA, then a new corresponding amino acid add to the tRNA. After that, these corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. Finally, these amino acids link together to form a protein beginning with a START codon and continue until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA.	e1ee87d614fbdae27ecfb1738edbc349	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, the mRNA first leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA, and each codon is recognized by a corresponding tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. This tRNA also carries an amino acid that corresponds to the codon it recognizes. As each tRNA recognises its complementary codon on the mRNA strand, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNAs bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, effectively linking together to form a protein chain starting with a START codon in the P site, marking the beginning of protein formation, a process referred to as initiation.	059c830e96c849ca35a20143978bc6f3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore to reach the ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the bases on the mRNA in groups of three, known as codons.

The process continues until a STOP codon is encountered, signalling the termination and resulting in a complete protein.	359d4ff93b0ac7c235c3e8adb5d1ff47	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA gets up and at 'em out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it hightails it faster than a jackrabbit on a date through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or might even head into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Each set of three bases on this mRNA, called a codon, is read by rRNA in what feels like trying to herd cats. Then comes along tRNA carrying an anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA codon, sorta like finding your perfect match at the county fair. A new amino acid is added to this tRNA, and these amino acids bond together with their neighbors until they hit a STOP sign, or I should say, a stop codon on the mRNA. It's quite the barn dance!	9618dd5737ca00d09d5e64a6d6930c38	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA buggers off from the nucleus through a nuclear pore and takes a wee trip through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, we have these wee groups of three bases on the mRNA called codons that are read by rRNA. Now, here's where tRNA comes into play - it carries the matching anticodon and recognises its partner codon on the mRNA. The amino acids attached to the tRNA then start a bit of a party, bonding together starting with a START codon in the old P site, this is what we call initiation. This goes on and on, linking more amino acids until a STOP codon pipes up in the A site, putting an end to the process - this is elongation and termination. And just like that, you've got yourself a protein!	ca6d6ff2b0492b8e8102b65654bf5b64	-1	-1
5	To initiate protein synthesis, mRNA first leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, its bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA. The process begins when a START codon is recognised in the P site, this initiates the assembly of amino acids into a protein chain. Corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA molecules are added one by one, each new addition forming a bond with the previous amino acid to elongate the protein chain. This sequence continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	29b4f2eb113bc67cec5a023ab2505905	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it voyages across the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets known as codons while tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes each respective codon. This process kickstarts peptide synthesis at a START codon placed in the P site, marking the initiation phase. In this stage, each corresponding amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain by tRNA. The elongation and termination phases continue this process of amino acid addition until a STOP codon surfaces on the mRNA at the A site, ultimately forming a protein.	f286f77a6407cb1e240293404fca5aed	-1	-1
5	Initiating the journey post nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it's bases are read by rRNA in triplets, known as codons. The next phase involves tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon that recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon, subsequently linking corresponding amino acids initiating at a START codon in the P site until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, thus forming a protein.	cb648925ff92e226f7f1a46d2ece227e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The sequence of bases on the mRNA are interpreted in triplets known as codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), an operation that initiates with a START codon at the P site, subsequently introducing new corresponding amino acids to each tRNA. These amino acids from adjacent tRNAs are then bound together, forming a protein through ongoing elongation until a STOP codon is eventually recognised at the A site, marking termination. Thus, this intricate process continually links amino acids until an entire protein is formed.	06f9361e61463f32ff471ac13092a7aa	-1	-1
5	A'ight, so first off, the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through this little thing called a nuclear pore, right? Now it's gonna travel through the cytoplasm and heads towards either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum - depends on where it's needed. On its way, it's read in groups of three bases, we call these codons, by something known as rRNA. Now here comes the part that's denser than chowder - tRNA that's carrying the complementary anticodon (think U=A, C+G) recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. As soon as that happens, protein synthesis kicks off with a START codon in the P site linking together amino acids to make a protein. This process keeps going until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site. At this point, it's about quieter than a midnight in the Commons because we've hit termination - no more amino acid linking. And Voila! We got ourselves a protein.	e4203e4bebfd2630b082d9c4c2f589fd	-1	-1
5	Alright, let me break it down for you nice and easy. Starting with mRNA, it moves out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore like a taxi leaving a rank, and it takes a trip to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, the mRNA bases are read in triplets, boet - these are called codons. Now, here's where tRNA comes into play; carrying the complementary anticodon, it recognises its match on the mRNA like two old friends bumping into each other at the local chisa nyama. A new amino acid is added to this tRNA and then these amino acids start linking together to make a protein - just like how a braai master would piece together the perfect boerewors roll. And finally, these linked amino acids from different tRNAs form a bond stronger than a team of rugby players in a scrum.	9ebab560dbc56033de63ba6c93fc9575	-1	-1
5	Following its exit from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA makes a beeline for the ribosome or hops into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, embarking on a journey as big as a prairie sky. As the mRNA bases are read in triplets (codons) by rRNA, tRNA carts in the complementary anticodon, recognizing the corresponding codon of the mRNA, and adds a new matching amino acid - a process as tight as a beaver's dam. This dance of adding amino acids to the tRNA continues hot as Toronto in July until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis. Thus, the amino acids are linked together into a protein starting with a START codon and ending with a STOP codon, much like an elegant ballet from initiation to elongation and termination.	b65a0eaa76b07f20283acc033b649c65	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having the genetic code for protein production, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of translation begins as the mRNA's codons (base triplets) are read by rRNA. In this stage, tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons, recognizes and binds to each complementary codon on the mRNA strand. Each time this happens, the corresponding amino acid that is attached to the tRNA is added and bonded with adjacent amino acids on another tRNA, creating a growing polypeptide chain. This sequence of events continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, which signals termination of amino acid addition and marks the completion of protein synthesis.	86eb5e87b2afa63a94cbd6c11d3a4463	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA bails oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore an then journeys through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, it's aboot the mRNA bases bein read in sets o' three, we call them codons, by rRNA. Next up, is the tRNA carryin the complementary anticodon that recognises the matchin codon of the mRNA, an at the ither end o' the tRNA, ye hae amino acids that get linked wi' adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. Finally, these amino acids keep on linkin up until a STOP codon gets read on the mRNA in the A site - we call this part elongation an termination.	75a749b98025e34af33606f6d7f96192	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, moving into the cytoplasm where it either approaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process advances as tRNA carrying a specific anticodon (matching U=A, C+G) identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, and this is followed by an amino acid being attached to the tRNA. The amino acids connected to each tRNA are then linked together, starting from a START codon, until a STOP codon signals termination, thereby creating a complete protein chain.	87976adae43ce78d59b5dc17ee6887a8	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travelling through the cytoplasm to find its destination: the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, in the ribosome, mRNA bases are meticulously read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, allowing tRNA carrying complementary anticodons to recognize their matching mRNA codon. As each new complementary codon is read, an appropriate amino acid is added to the growing chain on the tRNA, a process that initiates with a START codon in the P site. The protein continues to elongate, amino acid by amino acid, until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, thus marking the termination of protein synthesis.	479dac7d1f3e89aabaf009ae67dd002c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus via a nuclear pore, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The synthesis continues as mRNA bases are interpreted in triplets termed codons by rRNA and each codon is recognised by tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon. This process anchors the initiation of amino acid linkage to construct a protein, beginning at a START codon located in the P site. Subsequently, corresponding amino acids attached at the distal end of each tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNAs, and fresh matching amino acids are integrated into the tRNA chain, culminating in the formation of a protein.	7799ed5df3d12dfdae6d0e82444d08f3	-1	-1
5	Right, so the first major step is that the mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, just like a hurling ball leaving on the puck. Then, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, bang on like reading a book. Next up, each tRNA with its complementary anticodon recognises the corresponding codon of the mRNA and brings along a new amino acid - it's as if they're dancing to the same tune. These amino acids are then linked together starting from a START codon and continuing till a STOP codon is read, somewhat like knitting a jumper on the never never; you attach one loop to another until it's complete. All these steps ultimately lead to the formation of a protein.	c944ff7246887a27e912b2d6f4ce6735	-1	-1
5	Well now, y'all need to understand it's a process that starts with that mRNA skedaddling out of the nucleus, either hightailing it straight to the ribosome or taking a detour through that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then these little things called codons on the mRNA get read in sets of three by rRNA, sorta like reading a secret code. A START codon kicks off the hoedown, with tRNA bringing in the right amino acid to pair up with each codon on that mRNA line-up - just like picking the right dance partner at a square dance. This shindig keeps going, one amino acid at a time being added to the chain, until a STOP codon calls an end to the whole shebang. Ain't nothing faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, and this process sure ain't much slower!	73febab9a7d79ab33d693c8633a1f37b	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. 2. This mRNA is read in sets of three bases, called codons, by rRNA during the process known as translation, and the initiation starts at a START codon. 3. Complementary tRNA molecules recognize these codons on the mRNA, each tRNA carries a specific amino acid linked to it. 4. As these tRNAs recognize and bind to the mRNA's codons, their carried amino acids are connected together in a process called elongation, forming a protein chain. This continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, marking termination of protein synthesis.	75bf56f33e31098162aa026289b8f81d	-1	-1

Up next, tRNA enters the picture lugging along the complementary anticodon, recognizing that corresponding codon on the mRNA, about as precise as matching socks on laundry day. From there it's all systems go, with amino acids being linked together to craft a protein, starting with a START codon and keeping on truckin' till they hit a STOP codon.	2d142e675ce644daeccc853f5d6937a3	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA is out the nucleus via the nuclear pore like a rat up a drainpipe. It then hot-foots it through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or jumps into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA - a bit like reading a book three words at a time. Then our pal tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognises the matching codon of the mRNA. A new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, just like adding another brick to the wall. This process kicks off with a START codon in the P site, starting the chain of amino acids. The corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA are bonded together with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, linking them all up to form a protein.

5	Ah, you're askin' bout the protein dance, eh? Well, first off, mRNA says sayonara to the nucleus, scootin' out through a nuclear pore. It then takes a stroll through the cytoplasm hitchin' a ride to either the ribosome or the rough ER. This is where our buddy tRNA comes in carryin' the complementary anticodon, and it recognizes its mRNA pair (U's with A's and C's with G's). They start this cool chain reaction where amino acids are added one by one startin' from a START codon in the P site and keep addin' till they hit a STOP sign in the A site. All these steps give us one wicked protein.	b29965b21b6019ce8102fd5b655333ec	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus, catching a ride through the nuclear pore and heading high as the Drakensberg towards the cytoplasm where it joins up with a ribosome. Once there, tRNA – each carrying a complementary anticodon – recognises the corresponding codon on mRNA like they're old mates from high school. This starts off the party with an initiation phase at the P site, where a START codon grabs onto an amino acid – this is like adding ice to your rooibos tea on a hot day in the Karoo. The process carries on slow as a wet week, with more and more amino acids coming to join the jol and getting linked together until finally, a STOP codon arriving in the A site calls time on the festivities – this is your elongation and termination steps. So now you've got yourself a protein, all thanks to this intricate dance of molecules.	d417e6f9cd22c29b98be3a9f3d68ccf0	-1	-1

5	Beginning its expedition, the mRNA voyages through the nuclear pore and sets sail into the cytoplasm, charting a path towards the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Within this molecular metropolis, codons - three-lettered missives from mRNA - are deciphered by the rRNA within the ribosome, triggering a domino effect that commences with a START codon in the P site (initiation), followed by an influx of tRNA each bearing a unique amino acid. As if weaving a tapestry, these amino acids bond with their neighbors until an aptly named STOP codon halts the process (elongation and termination), leaving behind a completed chain of amino acids - a protein, the ultimate goal of our journey.	2591d7c4093c4db01eef253eca508fc7	-1	-1
5	The symphony of protein synthesis starts when mRNA, the conductor, bows out from nucleus via a nuclear pore, and taking up its position either at the ribosome or in the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. With rRNA as its attentive audience, the concert commences as mRNA's bases are deciphered in triplets, known as codons, by the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon; with this recognition comes a new corresponding amino acid added to the tRNA. The performance advances into its middle movement (the initiation phase) as amino acids are strung together like melodious notes to form a protein score, starting with a START codon in the 'P' site of the orchestra that is the ribosome. The production persists in its rhythm (elongation), linking amino acids tirelessly until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the 'A' site (termination phase), indicating the finale of the magnificent composition.	e2eba4de5c349f286bc01cce882bc867	-1	-1
5	Alrigh', so in protein synthesis, firstly mRNA takes a hike from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, just like scampering outta Fenway before the crowds hit. Then, this mRNA moseys on through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, kind of like cruising down the Mass Pike. Now, these mRNA bases get read in groups of three, we call 'em codons, by rRNA - like reading off the stats at a Sox game. Next up, our buddy tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes this codon on mRNA- think of it as recognizing your cousin from Southie at a packed Patriots game. Once that's done, it's all about adding new amino acids to the tRNA - like adding more beans to the pot. Then these corresponding amino acids at the other end of our tRNA get bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - tighter than a family reunion over on Revere Beach.	70dd800e6203cafa5141c6cc0d77cadf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a veld fire, it starts small and quickly intensifies. The mRNA exits the nucleus as leisurely as a wet week through the nuclear pore, then journeys through the cytoplasm like a nomad in the Karoo to get to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. By using rRNA, mRNA's bases are read in codons, similar to reading a three-word sentence in a novel. tRNA carries anticodons that match up with the mRNA's codons like puzzle pieces, each bringing along an amino acid as precious cargo. Once they're all lined up at the starting codon in the P site, it's go time! Each amino acid from the tRNA is bonded together faster than a bunny in a veld fire to create a brand-new protein. It's nature's own production line, dry as the Karoo but essential for life.	b290733b15a68d41a82d183bfc1f538c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, the blueprint, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore like a hockey player hitting the ice. It then journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum just like a puck glides on fresh ice. Here, the mRNA bases are read in triplets, called codons, by rRNA as meticulously as a goalie guards his net, and a start codon in the P site kick-starts the process, similar to the first drop of the puck in a game. Then, corresponding amino acids are added to tRNA as carefully as a player handles his stick, these amino acids becoming bonded together akin to how teammates support each other on-ice. This assembly continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of protein formation just like the final buzzer ends a match. So, much like our beloved hockey, protein synthesis is an intricate dance of elements working seamlessly together.	7e187705f38c52646846d17205889340	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a riveting journey, initiates when mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, making its way either to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA, carrying an anticodon that corresponds to mRNA's codon, recognizes its complementary pair following the U=A, C+G rule and effectively adding a new amino acid to its chain. This process of initiation and elongation continues as amino acids are sequentially added with the START codon at the P site, persisting until a STOP codon is read on mRNA at the A site, marking termination. The resulting string of amino acids, linked together through bonds between adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, finally synthesizes into a protein.	9fba1c74685f3351b71d4b3334c34100	-1	-1
5	Efter the mRNA scoots oot th' nucleus via a nuclear pore, it whizzes through th' cytoplasm richt tae the ribosome or dooks intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Wi' mRNA bases read in groups ay three - codons, a tRNA cairryin' th' matchin' anticodon (U=A, C+G) recognises its partner codon oan the mRNA. The saga starts wi' amino acids bein' linkit thegither tae forge a protein; this aw begins at a START codon in the P site. This dance carries oan, wi' correspondin' amino acids oan th' ither end ay the tRNA bondin' tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, until it hits a STOP codon oan the mRNA in the A site - signalin' th' end ay the reel.	6b7092d48c72efc3cf1f2d74fc6489db	-1	-1
5	Beginning when mRNA embarks on its journey from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it voyages through the cytoplasm until it finds its destination: the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the complex dance of protein synthesis takes place as rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets known as codons. The tRNA enters with an anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon and carries an amino acid to be added to the growing protein chain, initiating at a START codon in the P site. As more tRNAs arrive with their respective anticodons and amino acids, a link is formed, bonding adjacent amino acids together, gradually building up the intricate structure of a protein.	682577522d94d5026f964407e921372c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a transformative dance of molecular machinations, begins with the exodus of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This special molecule, like a coded message, is read in rhythmic triplets named codons by rRNA while tRNA, bearing a complementary anticodon, identifies its matching part on the mRNA and escorts it onto the stage. The tRNA carries an amino acid, a building block of life, that links with the amino acids brought by adjacent tRNAs, initiating this chain reaction at the START codon in the P site. And so, they continue to create their protein masterpiece until the STOP codon appears in the A site, signaling the end of their production and thus concluding their role in this magnificent biological performance.	4f11ec3774ae8ca798c79a16dc29443b	-1	-1
5	Emanating from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a journey through the cytoplasm to find its destination, either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This genetic blueprint is then deciphered by rRNA, reading in triplet sequences known as codons; a dance where tRNA sways carrying the complementary anticodon to pair with the mRNA's codon. The grand ball commences with a START codon at the P site, initiating a beautiful chain of amino acids forming a protein. This choreography continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site, signalling the end of elongation and the termination of protein synthesis. With each step of this ballet, a new corresponding amino acid is introduced by the ever-faithful tRNA.	aa162e9204f4ad63483977f7d39ed048	-1	-1
5	Sure as eggs is eggs, protein synthesis is a dance with four steps. First off, mRNA, as fast as greased lightning, leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and waltzes to the ribosome. Then, like reading the Sunday paper, the ribosome reads the codons in groups of three on our mRNA dancer. As wet as an otter's pocket, new amino acids are added to their partner tRNA and bonded together, starting their foxtrot at the START codon. Finally, they keep adding moves to their routine until they hit a STOP codon - it's been a grand dance, but all good things must end. That's your protein synthesis dance in a nutshell!	5b06c4859d9008fbeba9b8089314c9a9	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA rascal skedaddles out the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it hightails to the ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum quicker'n a cat with its tail on fire. Them mRNA bases are read in trios, known as codons, by rRNA like two peas in a pod. Then comes along a new amino acid onto tRNA, fitting together better than a banjo at a barn dance. These amino acids keep getting hitched up just like a long wagon train until they hit this STOP sign, called a STOP codon, right there on the mRNA in the A site. But before you know it, these amino acids have all linked up to form a protein, starting with a 'howdy partner' from a START codon in the P site. That's protein synthesis for ya - might seem complicated as a hog on ice, but really it's just nature's way of keeping things running smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy.	5b209bda5104248fbdd2c50cf92bc295	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process then proceeds in four major steps: First, rRNA reads the bases of the mRNA in sequences called codons. Second, the protein synthesis initiates at a START codon located in the P site where amino acids start to link together. Third, a tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognizes and pairs with the corresponding codon on the mRNA, adding a new matching amino acid to the growing chain. Finally, this linking of amino acids continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, which signals termination and results in a completed protein.	9d2c401ff72de6efcaf87dfcefb2703b	-1	-1
5	Firstly, after mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it goes either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA that carries the matching anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. In the next step, these mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons, by rRNA and a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. Lastly, these amino acids attached to the tRNA keep joining until they encounter a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call elongation and termination. This way, we build up proteins one bit at a time.	79f6f62c1fce41805da8641c257550f3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when the mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases, read in triplets called codons by rRNA, are recognized by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, leading to the addition of corresponding amino acids on tRNA, which are then linked to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids starting with a START codon in the P site. These linked amino acids form a protein chain, completing the process.	7cef6ad1c9c0c97b50c75a4362b8b7fb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, while tRNA carrying the anticodon recognizes and binds to the complementary codon of the mRNA. As this process continues, amino acids carried by tRNAs are linked together based on the sequence of codons until a STOP codon is encountered, resulting in the elongation and termination of the protein chain. Throughout this process, new corresponding amino acids are continuously added to tRNA molecules for subsequent rounds of protein synthesis.	20338921c0cd4cb553f8beb2026d0b69	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's kick this off. The mRNA gets goin' out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its way to the ribosome or it might head into the rough endoplacmic reticulum. Now, these mRNA bases are read in little groups of three, now we call these codons, and this is done by rRNA. The tRNA, carryin' an anticodon that pairs up real nice with the mRNA's codon, hops on the scene. Each one of these tRNA fellas has a unique amino acid hitchin' a ride, and they're matched up with the start codon tucked away in the P site - this here's what we call initiation. These amino acids get connected to the ones next to 'em on the tRNA, makin' up a string o' amino acids better known as our protein.	24e9568e2e868cf68439e0fec6a0a8c6	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA sneaks out the nucleus through a nuclear pore like a wee thief in the night. It then high tails it to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, the mRNA bases, read in groups of three known as codons by rRNA, are like a secret code waiting to be cracked. The tRNA, holding onto an amino acid and carrying the matching anticodon, recognises the codon on the mRNA like a long lost pal. This process keeps rolling along until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA, putting an end to this link-up of amino acids. This whole shebang from start to finish is how we get our proteins - beginning with that START codon in the P site (that's initiation for you) and ending with the stop codon in the A site (elongation and termination).	3b8ca38a71d6152ba7add0f5435091ee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, bearing the genetic code that will dictate protein production. It then attaches to ribosome, where rRNA reads the mRNA in triplets called codons. A tRNA molecule carrying a corresponding anticodon recognises and binds to each mRNA codon. This binding triggers the addition of a new amino acid to the tRNA, with these amino acids being bonded together in sequence to create a growing chain - this is known as the initiation phase. As the codons continue to be read and the corresponding amino acids added, this process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in what's termed the A site, signalling termination - completion of the protein synthesis. This intricate process results in proteins being assembled from amino acids, quite an incredible journey from nucleus to ribosome!	55db34af070b8316cb8738ab2bba5972	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, after departing the nucleus, travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum, a process where mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. The tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to these codons on the mRNA, at the same time attaching a new corresponding amino acid to itself. This marks the initiation phase with a START codon in the P site, leading to a series of amino acids being linked together to form a protein chain. This elongation continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, indicating termination. During this process, each amino acid at one end of a tRNA molecule forms bonds with adjacent amino acids on other tRNAs, ultimately creating a complex chain of amino acids - the nascent protein.	f2518e76ce5e01efce20effe38381794	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic instructions in triplets called codons that are recognized by rRNA. The process intensifies with the tRNA, which carries the complementary anticodon, recognizing these codons on the mRNA, leading to the addition of a corresponding amino acid to each tRNA. In an intriguing sequence known as initiation, protein development commences with a START codon in the P site, where these amino acids are linked together. The elongation and termination phases then unfold; amino acids continue to be connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read at the A site, whereupon the corresponding amino acids on opposite ends of the tRNA bond with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, culminating in the formation of a protein.	7e64f16773240a45758882b54aed45e2	-1	-1
5	Initiating protein synthesis, mRNA departs the nucleus via a nuclear pore, encountering the ribosome where rRNA reads its codons in triplets. tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons recognise and bind to these codons; with each binding, their respective amino acids are linked, creating a chain beginning with the START codon in the P site and ceaselessly growing until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site - a process of initiation, elongation and termination.	68d8fa4e1a066d9178dbb52528f980ad	-1	-1
5	Alright, wicked important stuff here, right? First off, that mRNA bolts from the nucleus, can't wait to exit through the nuclear pore. Now it's cruisin' the cytoplasm, heading to the ribosome or sneaks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While this is happening, our good ol' friend tRNA's hauling the complementary anticodon and spots its matching codon on the mRNA - they're like two peas in a pod. Then, magic happens: the amino acids on one end of the tRNA get bonded with those on the adjacent tRNA, and new ones keep getting added. It's like Fenway on game day - never a dull moment! This keeps up until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA. These amino acids are linked together from a START codon creating a protein. It's like driving down Storrow Drive during rush hour - you start moving and don't stop till you've gotta!	876cf8df3f16ec786dfc5e110a95de8b	-1	-1
5	Mzansi-style, let's break it down: First, the mRNA does a runner leaving the nucleus through the nuclear pore just as a Jo'burg taxi dodges potholes. Then, like a chameleon recognizing its surroundings, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA - nifty right? A new amino acid is added to this tRNA party; it's like adding another braai pack to the fire. The amino acids on the tRNA are bonded together; think of this as solid as a boerie roll. This mRNA with its precious cargo then travels through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, like exploring from Cape Town all the way up to Limpopo. These amino acids are then linked together starting from a START codon in the P site, it's go time! Lastly, similar to how we read our beloved isiZulu or Afrikaans words, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA - sharp sharp! In essence, it’s like a relay race from start to finish, except instead of passing batons, they're passing genetic info. This is all done for one purpose - to create proteins, strong as a lion, necessary for our bodies to function.	099d3d65c9a1b5ef94a118cb6131c6c8	-1	-1
5	Kicking off with mRNA skedaddling from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis is a fascinating process as steady as a Canuck's resolve. It's a dance: rRNA reads codons on the mRNA, then tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon steps in, much like finding a perfect match. From there, it's about building: amino acids start linking together at the START codon, constructing what feels as tight as a beaver's dam and continues until they hit the STOP sign codon. With every step, a new amino acid joins the tRNA party, getting bonded to the neighbours, making the chain hot as Toronto in July.	d5d8f5fd14e7f963449aa7fc4a53d7ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triples called codons commencing with a START codon in the P site, an initiation phase where corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA. This process continues as these amino acids are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, effectively linking them together to form a protein. Finally, this progression of linkage persists until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	fa539da69166df34bea352f2a835b8fc	-1	-1
5	The journey o' protein synthesis kicks aff wi' the mRNA makin' its way oot o' the nucleus via a nuclear pore. It then trots through the cytoplasm, heidin' towards the ribosome or divin' intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it meets up wi' tRNA, which is hauldin’ the complementary anticodon. The initiation phase starts when a START codon in the P site signals the beginning o' amino acid linkin'. This process continues, each new corresponding amino acid bein' added to the tRNA while mRNA bases are bein' read in triplets kent as codons by rRNA. The elongation and termination phases conclude wi' a STOP codon being read on the mRNA in the A site, markin' the culmination o’ our protein's creation.	13133003a79c41db993dfb1d643f3313	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when the mRNA, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or journeys to the cytoplasm's ribosome. The mRNA bases are read as triplets known as codons by rRNA; this process initiates when a START codon is identified in the P site, triggering tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon to recognize the mRNA's corresponding codon. Consequently, on the other end of the tRNA, amino acids bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a continuous chain that grows until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, thereby signaling termination. This sequence of events culminates in linking together amino acids to constitute a protein.	3c2c51d011947b6a7e79c79fb290fa7a	-1	-1
5	After the exit of mRNA from the nucleus via nuclear pore, it traverses through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, initiation occurs as amino acids start to link together forming a protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site. The tRNA carrying anticodons that are complementary (U=A, C+G) identifies and binds to the corresponding codon of the mRNA, and simultaneously, a new corresponding amino acid is recruited and added to the tRNA. As this process continues, elongation occurs where adjacent tRNA’s amino acids bind together while building upon each other until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read within the A site, signaling termination and thus culminating in the synthesis of the protein.	86c009ccfdeacae720aa304b3fe543f8	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a journey from the nucleus, mRNA exits via a nuclear pore and ventures into the cytoplasm till it encounters either a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, its bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, marking the initiation of protein synthesis when a START codon is identified in the P site. This intricate process links amino acids together to form a protein chain, where every new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA and bonded with its adjacent counterparts. The dance of creation continues in this fashion, elongating the protein chain until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, prompting termination.	f218511795935d38cf982d2b8f839f67	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process that's as complex as it's been going on for donkey's years. Starting off, mRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with information, leaves the nucleus and makes a mad dash, fast as greased lightning, through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where its bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA. The tRNA, carrying the anticodon, identifies the complementary codon of the mRNA like two peas in a pod. This leads to a new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA, which then gets bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, building up a protein chain starting from a START codon until a STOP codon appears.	f5818bf420e90bb59ff537e22d70c1b4	-1	-1
5	"Well now, let me tell ya, protein synthesis is a bit of a delicate dance, much like a cotillion on a warm Savannah evening. Firstly, you've got that mRNA, who's been hangin' around in the nucleus, finally hightailin' it out, almost as if it's seen a ghost. It takes a jaunt through the cytoplasm right to the ribosome or waltzes on inside that rough ER. Now, here's where things get interesting. That mRNA starts spoutin' off its codons - kinda like calling out square dance moves - and before you can say ""sweet tea"", tRNA steps up with its anticodon. This ain't no random pairing though, it's all carefully matched up like Sunday church clothes; U pairs with A and C gets cozy with G. Next thing you know, tRNA starts piling on new amino acids like biscuits at a breakfast buffet. They keep getting added till they kick-off a chain reaction, starting with a fancy term called the 'START' codon located in what the science folks call the P site. These amino acids keep getting strung together like pearls on a necklace until that old mRNA calls out a 'STOP' codon at the A site. And there you have it, from start to finish, that's how proteins are made; it's slower than molasses in January but as precise as a seamstress stitchin' a quilt."	2fff9e94a91642f562d03b91c2a84554	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moving into the cytoplasm where it is read by rRNA in triplets called codons.

The mRNA bases are read in threes, somethin' we call ""codons"", by rRNA. Now, tRNA carries the opposite (or anticodon) matchin' each codon on our mRNA. When the startin' gates open with a START codon in what we call the P site, this kicks off the process of linkin' together amino acids to make a protein. This ain't over in a coon's age though, oh no siree - this keeps goin', addin' a new amino acid for every tRNA, till we hit a STOP codon at the A site. It's kinda like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig, but I reckon that's how we get protein synthesis done 'round these parts."	e132df9b79ee5492d54545a06dab1519	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis dance kicks off when mRNA gets its kit off the nucleus, heading through the nuclear pore. Then, there's a bit of a blether between the mRNA bases and rRNA – they have a chinwag in triplets called codons. The tRNA rocks up next, carrying the complementary anticodon and recognises its pal, the mRNA’s complimentary codon. Now, here's where it gets interesting - a new amino acid's added to the tRNA, and these amino acids get all pally, bonding with adjacent ones on other tRNAs, kicking things off with a START codon in the P site. This wee gathering of amino acids keeps growing until they clock a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site – this marks the end of the shindig. All these steps together create what we call a protein, but it's not half as dry as it sounds!	eae862e6235061514f49fa544e0f2e03	-1	-1

Elongation continues until a STOP codon is read in the A site, signalling the termination of protein assembly. Thus, linked amino acids form a protein, completing the process of protein synthesis.	fc5961feb21b88342fd21ce3aa844c1e	-1	-1
5	Alright, first off, that mRNA bolts from the nucleus quicker than a Sox fan after a Yankees win. It either hooks onto a ribosome or sneaks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum like a Southie taking a shortcut. Now this is where it gets interesting, kid - them mRNA bases are read in sets of three, like codons, by the rRNA. It's like they're reading the menu at Durgin-Park before it closed down. Next up, you got your tRNA carrying the anticodon. This bad boy recognizes and pairs up with the mRNA's codon - just like Pats fans recognizing each other out in LA. On the other end of the tRNA, the amino acids start bonding with their neighbors - kinda like everyone does at a good old block party in Dorchester. Now we're cooking with gas. We start making a protein with a START codon in what science guys call the 'P site'. It's kinda like dropping the puck at a Bruins game. But instead of skating around, we just keep adding more and more amino acids till we hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in the 'A site'. And voila, we've got ourselves a protein. It's hotter than a T platform in August but hey, that's how proteins get made!	949dead432cffc78e860bb9a85639013	-1	-1
5	Eish, protein synthesis is a journey, but let me take you through it quick-quick. After the mRNA has left the nucleus like a springbok darting through the veld, it enters either the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Once there, tRNA with matching anticodons comes around to recognise the codon on the mRNA - it's like finding your boet in a busy stadium. The amino acids attached to these tRNA then bond with each other, as strong as a lion's jaw clamping down. This process keeps going, adding more and more amino acids to build this protein chain until a stop codon on the mRNA signals that it's time to wrap up the jol - this is where we reach elongation and termination.	8385530b652b35fcdeff9842f5f8ea1a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm, travelling to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA; this kickstarts the process of protein assembly by linking amino acids beginning with a START codon in the P site. As the process continues, corresponding amino acids are added to tRNA and bonded with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This sequence of adding and bonding amino acids goes on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, finalizing protein synthesis.	c541627ee3a776f63e90d07040683f04	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding mRNA codon. The process of translation initiates when an amino acid attached to a START codon on the tRNA is positioned at the P site of the ribosome and continues with subsequent amino acids being linked by recognizing the codons until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. The amino acids carried by each tRNA molecule bond together, creating a growing polypeptide chain that forms the final protein.	ec6e50b9a8e7024b0425d5f0d993694a	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA sneaks oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then it roams around the cytoplasm till it finds a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, caa'd codons. This is where tRNA comes intae play - it carries the anticodon that matches up wi' the mRNA's codon, using a system where U equals A, and C pairs wi' G. Once they're a' matched up, we kick off wi' protein production - this starts at a START codon located in the P site (this bit's known as initiation). After that, amino acids get linked together one efter another until eventually a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site gets read - this process is called elongation and termination. As these amino acids are getting linked, the corresponding amino acids on the other end o' the tRNA get bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	3afba73779c8757d4d8a7385646f164a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA bases, read in triplets called codons by rRNA, are recognized by tRNAs carrying complementary anticodons, resulting in corresponding amino acids being bonded together. This sequence begins with a START codon and continues until a STOP codon is encountered, effectively building a protein through initiation, elongation, and termination stages.	17b665e85defcc8ac1f2a63de9ba21b0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum, this is followed by initiation where a START codon in the P site begins the process of linking amino acids together to form a protein. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA and adds a new corresponding amino acid, these amino acids are then bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, elongating the chain until a STOP codon is read, signifying termination.	f19578861cf5ed1ca2889cf757212cd2	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has exited the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it travels either to a ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The mRNA bases are then read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. Each codon is recognised by a complementary anticodon on a tRNA molecule, which carries the corresponding amino acid. As these tRNAs recognise their matching codons, they add their amino acids to the growing peptide chain. This process, known as elongation, continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the mRNA sequence, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	2d19e370ccb4901ad046f7601256dfbf	-1	-1
5	Right, so after the mRNA has made its exit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it's off to the races. It makes a beeline either straight to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, like a greyhound out of the traps. Then, the fun begins. The mRNA bases are read in triplets, or codons, by the rRNA. This isn't some mickey-mouse operation, it's precise and meticulous work, not arseways at all. Then tRNA comes into play, carrying the complementary anticodon that recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA. Now, we're cooking with gas! The matching amino acids on the end of the tRNA get all cosy and bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids like old friends catching up after donkey's years. They're added one after another to make a protein chain that kicks off with a START codon in what they call the P site. It's as rare as hen's teeth to see such a complex and beautiful process in action!	ef18d7aae0557ba76a07b7572fe1f7b6	-1	-1
5	Well, once mRNA's done left the nucleus, it makes its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, these mRNA bases git read in groups of three called codons, that's by rRNA mind you. Then there's tRNA, which carries the complementary anticodon, and it takes notice of the matching codon on the mRNA. A new amino acid gets added to this tRNA. As soon as we spot a START codon in what's called the P site, we start hookin' them amino acids together to make us a protein - that's initiation for ya. This process keeps on goin' until a STOP codon shows up in the A site (that's called elongation and termination). And all along, them corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonding with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	d955662e4742fbbd77664ce2f8a27f15	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, after which it's codons are read in triplets by rRNA. An amino acid chain is then initiated at a START codon in the P site and tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes and binds to the mRNA's codons. As this process continues, amino acids are added to the growing protein chain until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals termination, completing the protein synthesis.	7a8c9d4ca6a4c82ae9c96079285134e2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then move to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Here, rRNA read mRNA bases in triplets known as codons. tRNA with the matching anticodon recognizes the similar codon of the mRNA, and a new corresponding amino acid is added to that tRNA. These amino acids bond to the ones on adjacent tRNA until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, marking the end of elongation and termination.	f194ccadec555b72e91e92949dbe5ab9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus through the nuclear pore and migrating to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytosol. The process starts with initiation where a START codon on the mRNA at P site initiates the assembly of amino acids into a protein, followed by elongation where tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the corresponding mRNA codon, allowing another corresponding amino acid to append to the growing protein chain. This sequence of adding amino acids, guided by the triplet codons on mRNA read by rRNA, continues until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, marking termination and finalizing the protein synthesis process.	07e164555f1172bce40243e770afde11	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, tRNA carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA's codon recognizes and binds to it. This process initiates protein formation with a START codon at the P site, followed by the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. The amino acids on the other ends of tRNAs bond together, forming a chain that continues to grow until a STOP codon is read in the A site, signaling termination of protein synthesis.	d54bb592e5c4e61f52186e26dcaf91ec	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! First off, mRNA gets the heck outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its way over to the ribosome or goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons, by rRNA, and tRNA comes along carrying the matching anticodon and a fresh amino acid. This process kicks off with what's called a START codon in the P site, initiating protein synthesis. The tRNA keeps adding on new amino acids until it hits a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, which tells it to put a lid on it and finish up the now-completed protein.	a9fa468d3e2ae906a2d8dba332d45f30	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA bails oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it trots on over to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here, its bases are read in wee groups of three, called codons, by rRNA. This kicks off wi a START codon in the P site – this is the initiation phase, mind. Then, along comes tRNA carryin' the complementary anticodon that recognises the corresponding codon of the mRNA. Now, these amino acids carried by tRNA start linkin' up like a ceilidh line until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site – this is your elongation and termination phases. The result? A newly minted protein, as strong as a lion.	dac0df0df1d6efe0fa8aedf023172990	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A tRNA carrying an anticodon that complements the codon on the mRNA recognises this codon, and a corresponding amino acid is added to this tRNA. The initiation of protein synthesis occurs at a START codon in the P site, linking amino acids together to form a protein. The elongation and termination stages involve continuous addition of amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, during which the bonded amino acids on adjacent tRNAs form the final protein structure.	e68f0856f0c6c6462ac807d502d759b2	-1	-1

Once at the ribosome, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets called codons, starting at the START codon in the P site. This initiates the process where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and attaches to the corresponding mRNA codon. Amino acids linked to each tRNA are bonded together in sequence until a STOP codon is read on mRNA, marking the termination of protein synthesis.	d84fc464841d8a59e0e697b8dc5b58d3	-1	-1
5	Starting from the nucleus, mRNA first migrates to the cytoplasm and attaches itself to the ribosome or goes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Its bases are then read in groups of three, called codons, by rRNA. The protein synthesis begins when a START codon is read in the P site, triggering the linking of amino acids together to form a protein chain. This process continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, marking both elongation and termination stages. Concurrently, tRNA molecules carrying matching anticodons (U=A, C+G) recognize and bind to the complementary codons of the mRNA; each tRNA has attached a corresponding amino acid. These amino acids from adjacent tRNAs are then bonded together as each new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain. Hence, protein synthesis encompasses mRNA transportation, codon reading, and sequential addition and bonding of amino acids steered by tRNA-mRNA interaction.	3b807f48f19a2bb2a8262234906b30a7	-1	-1

5	Aight, so firs' off, mRNA exits the nucleus via the nuclear pore and meanders its way to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA gets read in the ribosome in triplets called codons. Then, we got this tRNA with the complementary anticodon who recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA. As each new mRNA codon enters the ribosome, a new amino acid gets added to the tRNA. These amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are then bonded together to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This whole process keeps chuggin' along till a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in what they call the A site. This marks the end of elongation and kicks off termination. It's a wicked smaht process, kid.	1d3fa12e47efd23f5355a2113bdf332f	-1	-1

Then we see new amino acids being added to the tRNA, linking together like friends at a braai, all starting with a START codon in the P site - this is your protein initiation phase, like the start of a rugby match. This process carries on quick-quick until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of protein synthesis – that's your elongation and termination phase, mate.	49e7f57144bf61b7f4d7e829f095d5bb	-1	-1

This process, known as initiation, begins when a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding mRNA codon, marking the start codon in the P site. From there on, like linking together pieces for a winter bonfire, amino acids are linked together forming a protein chain during elongation, each tRNA bringing its specific amino acid and bonding it to the adjacent tRNA's amino acid until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signifying termination. It's a remarkable process that's as intricate as a beaver's dam but vital for life.	e3c63ddb0190f1df98418b2e66cf0562	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore. The ribosome (rRNA) reads mRNA bases in triplets, or codons, and each codon prompts a transfer RNA (tRNA) to add a corresponding amino acid. This tRNA carries an anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA. These amino acids are bonded together by peptide bonds, forming a chain that begins with initiation at a START codon in the P site and continues with elongation until a STOP codon is read in the A site, marking termination. This sequence results in the formation of a protein.	0e7d2fa761b05ce0940eab6ee6ed7f6e	-1	-1

First off, that mRNA leaves the nucleus and hightails it to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, kinda like a letter carrier on his daily route. Then, inside the ribosome, mRNA bases get read in triplets known as codons by some rRNA, which is about as complicated as trying to put lipstick on a pig. Next up, tRNA swoops in with amino acids and matches its anticodon with the complementary codon on the mRNA - they pair up tighter than bark on a tree. This process keeps on truckin' until a STOP codon pops up in the A site, signalling that it's time to wrap things up.

So, it all starts off when mRNA says cheers to the nucleus and takes a gap through the nuclear pore. It then treks through the cytoplasm, like it's on a hike in the Drakensberg, to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here's where things start to get lekker. The mRNA bases are read in threes, much like how we love our three-piece chicken meal, these are called codons. Then enters our tRNA mate carrying an anticodon that recognises and pairs up with its buddy mRNA codon like a Braai master knowing his chops. This duo ensures that a new troepie (amino acid) is added onto the tRNA. These amino acids bond together with their neighbours as tightly as a scrum in a rugby match until they come across a STOP sign (codon). Once they see this sign, they know it's time to call it quits and hang up their boots for the day. This process of adding on and stopping forms the main part of the game, known as elongation and termination. And voila! There you have it -  protein synthesis done and dusted!	475df00331030c14c67ddb553adf040e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, like a finely tuned relay race, starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and venturing into the cytoplasm, almost as changeable as Maritime weather. It finds its way to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum where it's read in triplets called codons by rRNA, which is as tight as a beaver's dam process. Next comes initiation, where amino acids start linking from a START codon in the P site, then elongation kicks in as tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes the mRNA's codons, and like a well-oiled machine, continues adding amino acids until a STOP codon in the A site is reached. Lastly in termination, the joined amino acids forming the protein are released, ending this process that's as efficient yet complex as a Yukon winter.	1b3171c584f4a591c25469047d76e978	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are read by rRNA in triplets known as codons, whereupon the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies and aligns with the corresponding mRNA codon. During the phase of initiation, amino acids start to be linked together to form a protein starting with a START codon in the P site, and a new corresponding amino acid is added to each successive tRNA. This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is reached on the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination phase, thus resulting in a fully synthesized protein chain.	37ac251e9c02cb57db0a1cfed7345c88	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA skites oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, the tRNA, bearin' the complementary anticodon, spots the matchin' codon on the mRNA. The mRNA birls through the cytoplasm till it reaches the ribosome or dives intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A new correspondin' amino acid is plopped onto the tRNA. This process gaes on an’ on, addin' amino acids until a STOP codon is read oan the mRNA i' the A site. All the while, the mRNA bases are bein' read in groups o’ three, kent as codons, by rRNA. Lastly, amino acids at the ither end o’ tRNA get bonded tae the neighbourin' tRNA's amino acids.	91434b936c3bba33d39ee619adb05fba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through cytoplasm to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA is then read in triplets, called codons by rRNA, a process where each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid which is delivered by tRNA; this tRNA recognizes the complementary codon on the mRNA using its anticodon. Initiation involves the assembly of these components at the start codon on the mRNA. Once all elements are in place, elongation starts with the linking together of amino acids as dictated by the codons until a stop codon is reached, indicating termination of protein synthesis. This sequence of steps results in the formation of a polypeptide chain - essentially a protein.	4fafbe5f49b96cfbddc58149ac3c1d52	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic code in triplets called codons to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, which carries an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon and a corresponding amino acid, binds to the mRNA, leading to the addition of new amino acids and their subsequent linking until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site; this signals termination and results in a completed protein.	aaa4cac5f6e8e2157b10892db667bcac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The mRNA's codons, read by rRNA in sets of three, dictate the sequence of amino acids added to tRNA molecules; these are then bonded together sequentially by matching anticodons on tRNA, aligning with the START codon for initiation. As this process continues, each new corresponding amino acid is added to the chain until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling the end of elongation and triggering termination. This series of events results in a newly synthesised protein assembled according to the original mRNA blueprint.	d3d47cf057e454aca54d75ec782c140a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is far from going arseways in our cells! It all starts when mRNA makes its quare journey out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore, heading to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, it's met by tRNA carrying anticodons that are as complementary as U is to A and C is to G. These anticodons recognise their matching codon on the mRNA like hen's teeth, rare but not impossible! Keep in mind now, this tRNA isn't just coming for a visit, it's also bringing along amino acids which get bonded together with adjacent ones, forming a chain that kicks off at a START codon and keeps adding new links until it hits a STOP codon. This process of initiation, elongation, and termination is how we end up with proteins, those vital components that keep us ticking over!	041f65f4099ece2f99e82d5eb4e81f6e	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, here's how it goes. First off, that mRNA scoots on out the nucleus through a pore and makes its way either to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Now, them mRNA bases are read in groups of three, we call 'em codons, by something known as rRNA. Then a tRNA carrying an anticodon, which matches up just right with that mRNA codon (thinkin' U=A and C+G), comes along with a specific amino acid attached. Those amino acids get joined together startin' with a START codon in what's called the P site - this here's the initiation process. Now they keep on linking like kin at a family reunion until they come across a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site - that there's your elongation and termination. So, you see, it's all about making proteins by hooking up those amino acids in the right order.	6623d52103e21b3c62821a625442fc22	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis sees the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore then moving to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, carrying an anticodon that matches the codon on the mRNA, then brings in corresponding amino acids which are bonded together, starting with a START codon in the P site and continuing until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, thus completing the process of protein formation.	878ed98dfd930054c65a59a3fd1d4bb7	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaves nucleus through nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or goes into rough endoplasmic reticulum in cytoplasm. Two, there tRNA bearing complementary anticodon recognizes matching codon of mRNA. Three, corresponding amino acid is added to tRNA then amino acids on other end of tRNA bond to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. Four, beginning with a START codon in P site, this process of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon is read on mRNA in A site, thus making a protein.	9bc5c9500ca1cb9451be5da935b35d8b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and being read by rRNA in triplets, known as codons. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding mRNA codon, leading to amino acids being linked starting with a START codon in the P site and continuing until a STOP codon in the A site is read, creating a protein chain. Throughout this process, new relevant amino acids are continually added to the tRNA, and these amino acids are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This procedure is divided into initiation, elongation, and termination phases.	8567f170a2358a953d48aa9281a9bbb7	-1	-1

The tRNA, carrying its specific anticodon, identifies the matching codon on the mRNA. 3. The process of protein synthesis initiates with a START codon at P site, correlating amino acids on tRNA bind with adjacent ones, forming a chain. 4. Chain elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, leading to termination and final protein formation.	ed9084310722186702963b91d3bbc96e	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's kick things off with the mRNA headin' out from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once it hits the cytoplasm, that little buggy travels on over to the ribosome or scoots into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where things get slicker than snot on a glass doorknob. That mRNA's bases are read in triplets, called codons, by none other than rRNA. With each codon that's read, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA - it's like an assembly line for amino acids! This process keeps churnin' and burnin', linkin' those amino acids together from the START codon all the way 'til a STOP codon is read. This whole shebang starts at the P site (that's initiation for ya) and keeps going until that STOP codon pops up in the A site (elongation and termination). So there ya have it - protein synthesis in a nutshell!	05206da9a47039be0572ba2578e6453a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a canny process starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and gallivanting to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Now, the tRNA, as strong as a lion, carrying its complementary anticodon identifies the matching codon of mRNA and adds a new corresponding amino acid to it. Then, these amino acids join hands together starting from the START codon in the P site, continuing this mince until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site - that's initiation, elongation, and termination for ye. Mony a mickle maks a muckle, and so each tiny step forms a significant part of protein synthesis.	d6ff6e8fce4c763f8e214fd4a6812af2	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus via the nuclear pore, the molecule travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases, read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, correspond with a tRNA carrying an anticodon which recognises its complementary codon on the mRNA. This process continues as a new corresponding amino acid is added to each tRNA, with these amino acids then bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This elongation of sequence proceeds until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signalling termination and thus completing protein synthesis.	5dbc5fc49bea3b57cd5cf63d2e5dbe45	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon arrival, the process of translation starts; the mRNA bases are read in groups of three called codons by rRNA while a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon binds with a corresponding codon on the mRNA. Following this, a new amino acid is attached to each tRNA molecule, these amino acids then get bonded to adjacent ones on other tRNA molecules. This sequence continues, linking amino acids together to form a protein chain which initiates at a START codon located in the P site.	0d04634b70cfabf9f8b30d6b2cafadf7	-1	-1

5	First off, mRNA bolts from the nucleus through the nuclear pore like a Sox fan tryna catch the T after a game. Then it heads to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, quieter than a midnight in the Commons. Here's where it gets interesting: tRNA, with its anticodon that's a perfect match for mRNA's codon, schleps over the right amino acid; it's like a Southie dockworker humpin' cargo. Then, starting with a 'START' codon in the P site, these amino acids start linkin' up—stronger than a handshake at a Townie reunion—until they hit a 'STOP' codon, completin' protein synthesis.	e04b92634b01f095b133760cb2c5d6e3	-1	-1
5	Starting high as the Drakensberg, our journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travelling small-small either to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes the second step slow as a wet week - the mRNA bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes this codon on mRNA. From there, we move to the third step where amino acids start to party, kicking off with a START codon in the P site, they get linked together one by one to form a protein chain.

5	Indeed, protein synthesis is a bang on sequence of events. mRNA, as fast as greased lightning, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In this dance, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, starting with a START codon in the P site—this marks the initiation of the process. The tRNA holding the complementary anticodon locks onto the complementary codon of the mRNA, and a fresh matching amino acid is added to the tRNA.

Now once it's in the cytoplasm, it heads on over to either the ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got these things called codons -- groups of three mRNA bases -- startin' off with what they call a START codon, all gettin' read by rRNA. It's kind of like it's decipherin' a secret language. Now the real magic happens when amino acids are added onto the tRNA, and these fellas start linkin' up, startin' at where our dear START codon is located in the P site. These amino acids keep on joinin' hands till they hit a STOP codon on that there mRNA in the A site - this part is somethin' they call elongation and termination. Once they've all linked up nice and proper, you got yourself a protein!	f682b0c1b4331a373f95b5a1bf5884c5	-1	-1

This process, known as initiation, commences with the reading of a START codon by rRNA. Subsequently, tRNA carrying an anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon arrives, and a corresponding amino acid is attached to the tRNA. This mechanism, called elongation, continues as more tRNAs identify complementary codons on mRNA and attach their particular amino acids, forming a chain. The synthesis is concluded when a STOP codon is identified on mRNA—this step is termed termination. Hence, we witness the creation of a protein through the bonding of various amino acids.	954c0378dff49449426955f8dbcd4ae0	-1	-1

Once it deh deh, the tRNA weh carry the anticodon weh match the codon of the mRNA comes up next and recognizes it. Now after that, you get the amino acids weh at the other end of the tRNA bonding with the amino acids on another tRNA close by. This process keeps going, adding more and more amino acids onto the protein chain until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in what we call the A site. That's when protein synthesis does end. So from start to finish, is a series of steps all working together fi make the proteins we need.	034c0345c9cb054a55353b602baa0f26	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome, or it enters the rough endoplic reticulum.

As it gets there, them mRNA bases are read in groups of three, those're called codons, by rRNA. Now, here's where it gets as detailed as frog hair - tRNA carrying the opposite or complementary anticodon recognizes and attaches to that mRNA codon. That tRNA's haulin' around a corresponding amino acid that gets added to its own chain. Then you've got more and more of these amino acids linkin' up until a STOP codon on that mRNA is read in the A site - this here's your elongation and termination stages.

5	First off, that mRNA scoots right outta the nucleus through a little door we call a nuclear pore. Now it's in the big city - the cytoplasm - and it's gotta find a ride to the ribosome or hop into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Before you know it, we've got tRNA reading those mRNA bases in groups of three, like they're reading a Sox scorecard. These triplets are called codons, and each one's got its own anticodon buddy on the tRNA that recognizes it. Now comes the fun part - each of these anticodons on the tRNA has its own amino acid, and these guys start linking up like Sox fans after a big win.

5	Protein synthesis in our bodies is high as the Drakensberg, but not quite slow as a wet week. Starting off, mRNA bids the nucleus cheers and takes a trip to either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where the magic happens - these mRNA bases are read in threes, kind of like a good old riddle, they call it codons. This is where tRNA comes into play, carrying the anticodon that matches up with the codon on our mRNA.  With each match, there's an amino acid on the tRNA which gets linked to its neighbouring amino acid, creating a chain faster than a veld fire. And this all starts with what they call a START codon in the P site, and carries on adding more amino acids until it meets a STOP codon on the mRNA's A site. So in essence, we're building a protein brick by brick using these amino acids until the foreman yells 'STOP'. Isn't biology just lekker?	ed29f6254062f7e887d78fb7454cb5fc	-1	-1
5	In the grand, complex dance of protein synthesis, mRNA pirouettes from the nucleus to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The tRNA, a skilled partner, recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, like a loon honing in on a fish in a lake. Its cargo, amino acids, are linked together into a protein chain starting with a START codon, bigger than a prairie sky with potential. This sequence continues, as constant and steady as the flow of the mighty St. Lawrence River until reaching a STOP codon. All the while, each new amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain, as tight as a beaver's dam construction. Ultimately, we're left with a newly synthesized protein, its creation process as fascinating and intricate as our beautiful country itself.	a35c0930c8f0d6a04c4f0cfd74130cf4	-1	-1

The initiation phase starts when amino acids are linked together at the P site starting with a START codon. A new amino acid corresponding to each codon on the mRNA is then added to the chain on the tRNA, creating a growing protein chain. This elongation process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. Finally, adjacent amino acids on different tRNAs bond together, completing the formation of a new protein molecule.	233003c8e65a71e04ffaf0ff03f50e5a	-1	-1
5	A'right, mate. Here's the hoolet: First aff, mRNA buddies up wi' the ribosome or makes a journey intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, mRNA bases are read in wee groups o' three called codons, courtesy o' rRNA. Then, tRNA kickin' aboot wi' the complementary anticodon (U=A, C=G) gets a whiff o' the similar codon on the mRNA. This sparks aff a chain reaction - new matchin' amino acids get added tae the tRNA and these amino acids start linkin' together tae build up a protein starting wi' a START codon at the P site, this is what we call initiation. These amino acids keep on joinin' until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA at the A site - this is where we say cheerio tae elongation and wave hello to termination. Et voila! Ye've got yerself a brand new protein.	d4ccb28c96b04f5979e827db583da69d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex but fascinating process that starts with messenger RNA (mRNA) leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The mRNA then journeys through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, serving as a blueprint for protein construction. At the heart of this process are triplets of mRNA bases known as codons, which are read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon, recognizes these codons and brings along a corresponding amino acid. As this recognition and pairing continue, amino acids from adjacent tRNAs bond together, gradually constructing a protein chain. This elongation phase persists until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the termination of protein synthesis. Hence, through these major steps - mRNA exit from nucleus, movement to ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, codon-anticodon recognition by tRNA and rRNA, and linking of amino acids until reading a STOP codon - cells are able to produce proteins vital for various biological functions.	ae06663cf0b808fed026adc66406b084	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, its bases are read in triplets by rRNA, called codons. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes each of these codons on the mRNA and positions itself accordingly. The initiation phase commences with a 'START' codon in the P site, where a new corresponding amino acid is added to each tRNA. These amino acids, linked at the other end of the tRNA, bond together with adjacent tRNA's amino acids forming a protein chain. This process continues until a complete protein is synthesized.	b9e5411735de74cfa7db5b6997fff265	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis follows a captivating process. Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and voyages through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Concurrently, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, leading to the addition of a corresponding new amino acid to the tRNA. These corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a chain. Finally, this chain is extended until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking an end to elongation and initiating termination, indicating that our protein is synthesized!	aa9201c3cc8803561b7613f8f8f71e76	-1	-1
5	Let's kick off with the mRNA doing a runner from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, as fast as greased lightning, heading to the ribosome or making a grand entrance into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are sussed out in groups of three called codons, thanks to our good pal rRNA. Then our friend tRNA, holding onto its complementary anticodon, comes into play and recognises the matching codon on the mRNA. With each new entrant, it's like an ongoing party where a new amino acid is added to the tRNA. After that we have the beginning of a beautiful creation - with the 'START' codon puck in the P site we get our first linked amino acids which start making up the protein. This continues on, linking one after another on the never never until we hit the 'STOP' codon read on the mRNA in the A site. So there you have it, four major steps involved in protein synthesis!	75ee4ca38bb0b8a7d537585d0cec4c89	-1	-1
5	"Well, it's quite the journey for our little mRNA buddy! Ain't nothing easy about what it's about to do. First off, it leaves the nucleus like a bat outta hell through this thing we call a nuclear pore. Then, it skedaddles through the cytoplasm till it finds itself a ribosome or maybe hops into the rough endoplasmic reticulum if it's feeling adventurous. Now once mRNA has settled in, it's read in groups of three bases called codons by something called rRNA. Just think of them as tiny instructions on how to build our protein. Each one of these codons is recognized by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G). It's like fitting puzzle pieces together! Then comes the building part, which I reckon is my favorite. Every time tRNA reads a codon correctly, a new amino acid is added. This keeps happenin' till a STOP codon comes up in the mRNA. It's like when mama used to tell us kids ""enough is enough!"" That's when we know that our protein is finally done being put together. And there you have it! Four major steps of protein synthesis: exiting the nucleus, reading the codons, matching 'em with anticodons, and adding those amino acids till we got ourselves a brand spankin' new protein. But remember, y'all - this ain't no walk in the park. It's complicated work down there at the microscopic level!"	580c0f317f9a2345c854381ebdad4b01	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Its codons are read by rRNA in sets of three. tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, recognizes each codon on the mRNA, and its corresponding amino acid is added. This process continues with each amino acid bonding to its adjacent one, starting from a START codon and ending at a STOP codon, forming a protein.	0e9d05b29afb17210fece3239de2d51b	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA exit nucleus through nuclear pore, it then journey in the cytoplasm to ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two, tRNA carrying matching anticodon recognize the complementary codon of mRNA. Three, new corresponding amino acid is add to tRNA. Four, so long as STOP codon isn't read on mRNA in A site, amino acids link up (elongation and termination). It's like making a chain where mRNA bases are read in sets of three, we call them codons.	67ad281b88a680a7e637adc645c9ba5c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels to the ribosome or into the rough endoplic reticulum. The next step, initiation, starts when tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the mRNA's complementary codon starting with a START codon in the P site. This triggers the process of elongation where a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA and these amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, marking the termination of protein synthesis. Finally, amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids forming a protein.	74aad1d9ae781665a988802330a6ba46	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus via nuclear pore and travels to ribosome in cytoplasm. Second, tRNA with anticodon recognizes the codon of mRNA. Third, amino acids on tRNA bond together starting with a START codon until a STOP codon is read. Finally, new corresponding amino acid is added to tRNA and protein is formed.	34267aa5936dd3765fa8b0354f19891e	-1	-1
5	"Alrighty, here's the scoop: First off, that mRNA guy skedaddles right out of the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then it moseys on over to either the ribosome or this other joint known as the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Now, this is where things get real interesting- mRNA bases are read in groups of three, kinda like bingo numbers, these are called codons. Hang tight with me now, 'cause here comes the tRNA carrying what we call an anticodon- it recognizes its buddy codon on the mRNA. Then we got these fellas called amino acids that start linkin' together to make a protein, sorta like building blocks, starting with a START codon in the P site (we call this initiation). These amino acids keep on linking until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site- just like hollering ""Bingo!"" at the end of a round. That finally puts a halt to things (we call this elongation and termination). Oh, and don't forget, every time a new codon is read, a brand spanking new corresponding amino acid gets added to the mix!"	f9513a0fe8f05946198ae071d798d73e	-1	-1
5	So, first off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus and heads for a ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. On its journey, the mRNA is read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Next up, a wee tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the mRNA's codon. Nae wind, nae wave, a new matching amino acid is added to the tRNA. From here, these amino acids get linked together to form a protein, kicking off from a START codon in the P site, as damp as a dungeon. The process keeps trucking on until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read - this signals the end of the line. Last but not least, the corresponding amino acids on each tRNA get bonded together, heavy as a lead balloon!	0dc65d8c087b74d1d75b67ad1a6db3e0	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it voyages through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, the mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA. The protein synthesis then starts with a START codon in the P site where amino acids are linked together. This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. Lastly, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, creating a complete protein.	debe7a8d4665fad645492d808490c933	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and travelling through the cytoplasm to a ribosome, or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the mRNA's bases are read in triplet sequences known as codons by rRNA molecules, thus initiating protein synthesis. This process continues with transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules recognizing and attaching to complementary mRNA codons using their anticodons. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid, which then gets added to a growing chain of amino acids until a stop codon on the mRNA is read, signaling the termination of protein synthesis. These amino acids then link together, forming a protein that corresponds to the sequence of codons in the mRNA molecule.	d5de64f1f0d50199ea2757f905b22f1b	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then journeys either to the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Here begins protein synthesis; initiation, where a START codon in the P site triggers the linking of amino acids. A tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, and an appropriate amino acid is attached to this tRNA. This process of elongation continues until a STOP codon on mRNA is detected, leading to termination, and creating a chain of bonded amino acids - our newly synthesized protein!	1d48c134d6ece84e76698c37117a4601	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or it may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read by rRNA in groups of three, known as codons. This process initiates with a START codon in the P site, marking the beginning of amino acid assembly to form a protein. Further amino acids are added to corresponding tRNA molecules and linked until a STOP codon is reached, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	aa4803bd92b17e9743ddaddb9c4807b3	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA makes its way outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then you got your tRNA, which carries the matching anticodon and recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA - kinda like recognizing your buddy at a Sox game, ya know? Those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons. Next up, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. It's sharper than a Sox fan's wit, I tell ya! Those corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA get bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The whole process kicks off with a START codon in the P site, linking amino acids together to make a protein. This keeps going until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. And there you have it, protein synthesis hotter than a T platform in August!	ebfd9f3afa0135ddc4f301f3ee0afbf4	-1	-1
5	The process starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, journeying to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's like a traveller embarking on an adventure, hey? The mRNA bases are then read in codon triplets by rRNA, akin to reading a secret language. Then, tRNA bearing anticodons that complement those of the mRNA show up, like long-lost twins finding each other. This tRNA carries new amino acids that are added to it, as if they're loading their veld fire-fighting equipment. Finally, these amino acids keep linking until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, almost like a lion calling an end to its hunt after a successful catch. This results in the formation of a protein - strong as a lion yet as precise as a feather's flight path!	1114a6bc1f17c72c9c156c5937a72c2f	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA navigates through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read in groups of three known as codons by rRNA. Concurrently, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the matching codon on the mRNA, followed by a new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA. This process persists until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, ending the elongation and ensuring adjacent tRNA's amino acids are bonded together.	b0df4e28c7b8514fe4b7b58c9be523e8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore. It then moves to the ribosome where the mRNA bases are read in triplets known as codons. A tRNA molecule, carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA, enters the ribosome and attaches to the mRNA. Next, an amino acid corresponding to the tRNA is added. This process of reading codons and bonding amino acids continues (called elongation) until a STOP codon is encountered which signals termination of the protein chain. These bonded amino acids form a peptide chain, ultimately creating a protein.	c85bed055f683ab04ed00846802c5476	-1	-1
5	First aff, the mRNA bids cheerio tae the nucleus through a nuclear pore and trots alang the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or slips intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's then that the tRNA wi' its complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) spots the matching codon o' the mRNA. Each mRNA base is read in threes, we call these wee groups ‘codons’, courtesy o’ some rRNA. As this is gaun on, there's a new amino acid added tae the tRNA. This keeps happenin', wi' amino acids bein' strung together like beads on a necklace till a STOP codon pops up in the A site on the mRNA, signalin' it’s time to call it a day.	6742c0dccd0f8892016ba6d7af246767	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and navigates to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. This mRNA, with its bases read in triplets called codons by rRNA, is then recognized by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon. The process continues with initiation, where amino acids start linking together to form a protein from a START codon in the P site, and more amino acids are added to the tRNA (elongation). The synthesis halts when a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, terminating the addition of new corresponding amino acids.	d0faffb7b7b7e3cc7b932d68b3837926	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore. The mRNA's bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA and tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, resulting in an addition of the corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. Amino acids start linking together to form a protein, commencing with a START codon in the P site, a process referred to as initiation. This continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and signaling termination. Throughout this process, amino acids on one end of tRNA bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, thus facilitating protein synthesis.	5b46e88a15b8ca9990ffe1792cb916a4	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it voyages through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Each of the mRNA's bases are read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. Further into this fascinating process, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises and attaches to the mRNA's corresponding codon, while a new respective amino acid is added to its structure. The corresponding amino acids on other ends of the tRNA bond to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, leading to the constant linking of these amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination.	99121479019c15f1d896a622ff64ce9d	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's spell this out then. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, it travels to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we have these triplets, called codons on the mRNA, that are read by rRNA. Now we get into the thick of it - tRNA swoops in with the complementary anticodon and recognises its matching codon on the mRNA, bang on like a perfect match! This leads to a new amino acid being added to the tRNA. Finally, these amino acids keep getting linked until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA - and that's when you know you've done it arseways and it's time to wrap it up. So there you have it - four major steps in protein synthesis!	6381a2d1348ef40ca5e1dc2f06452e86	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin' such a question! Let's start with this little fella mRNA skedaddlin' out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then we got these triplet codons on the mRNA caught by rRNA. It's kinda like hollerin' out Bingo numbers and hopin' y'all have the match. Now each tRNA's sportin' an anticodon that pairs up right nice-like with that mRNA codon. But don't be fooled, they ain't all hat and no cattle, 'cause they're towin' along an amino acid too. One by one, these amino acids get strung together like beads on a necklace, startin' from a special START codon. Before you know it, you got yourself a full-fledged protein. Ain't that as useful as a chocolate teapot!	bbd565574adc8b874e492db1c9dfc188	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. This reading process identifies START and STOP codons for protein initiation and termination respectively. tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons, recognizes corresponding mRNA codons to add new amino acids, which are then linked together progressively to form a protein.	8c78fc7a74c68077d802d8b34148896f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commence when mRNA exit nucleus, an' head to ribosome inna di cytoplasm or through rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA base trios, we call codons, get read by rRNA and then tRNA with de right anticodon (U=A, C+G) do recognize it and match up. Now each of these tRNA deh carry a specific amino acid, so when they find their matching codon pon the mRNA, that amino acid get added to di growing chain. Di process keep go on and more amino acids join up till one STOP codon reach pon the mRNA in the A site, and that's when everything ceases - di elongation an' termination part.	c8e467d05f6419e3289583903e3ae681	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA exits the nucleus heading for the cytoplasm where it encounters the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA begins reading the mRNA's codons, sequences of three bases, initiating the process with a START codon at the P site, subsequently adding corresponding amino acids to a tRNA molecule, and elongating the chain until a STOP codon appears in the A site. As this process persists, adjacent tRNA’s amino acids bind together, diverging momentarily from protein synthesis to create a complex structure that will eventually culminate in a fully synthesized protein.	183843fce9fd9649a4689dfa210daf52	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA voyages into the cytoplasm where it meets the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA with corresponding anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, and a new matching amino acid is attached to the tRNA. The process of linking these amino acids starts with a START codon in the P site, known as initiation, and continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination. This sequence results in protein creation.	725b17a7860b127d18c56d12e4be3c6d	-1	-1
5	Well, ya start off with this thing called mRNA takin' off from the nucleus quicker'n greased lightning. It then hightails it through the cytoplasm to this place called the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, there's a whole mess of these things called tRNA's which've got anticodons that match up with the mRNA's codons - kinda like findin' your partner at a square dance. Then, these amino acids get strung together like beads on a necklace, startin' with a START codon and keepin' on till we hit a STOP codon. When all's said and done, you've got yourself a brand new protein! Ain't science somethin'?	35296d7a5beb5e10683518ad73cdcca4	-1	-1
5	Kicking off wi' mRNA leaving the nucleus, it takes a wee journey through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Upon hitting the START codon in the P site, that's when amino acids are strung together like beads on a necklace to form a protein. The whole shebang keeps going, with tRNA carrying the anticodon that recognises its codon match on mRNA and roping in a new amino acid each time. This goes on until a STOP codon crops up on the mRNA in the A site; nae more amino acids are added and we hit full stop - elongation and termination complete.	cb43bea1e4a4fd7ed01caed3b5d36d92	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus, it navigates to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum via the cytoplasm. The protein synthesis then commences with tRNA carrying matching anticodons recognising and attaching to their corresponding codons on the mRNA. This leads to the initiation stage where a protein chain begins with a START codon in the P site. A continuous addition of amino acids to the growing protein chain is facilitated by tRNAs, while their corresponding amino acids bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The process of elongation persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected in the A site, marking the termination phase of protein synthesis.	3da566de8e74ab09b9246880345a395c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA translocating from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA, which has codons read in groups of three by rRNA, heads to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where the protein-building process initiates at a START codon situated in the P site, linking amino acids to form a protein. The process involves tRNA carrying anticodons that recognize and bind to complementary mRNA codons and attach corresponding amino acids to the expanding polypeptide chain.	159203a58e081ab867fc7de3dd04feb3	-1	-1
5	Upon its departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA traverses the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or infiltrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA, which includes codons that are sets of three bases, then initiates protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site, thus beginning the process of stringing together amino acids. This process continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, marking the termination of elongation. Concurrently, each existing tRNA molecule receives a newly corresponding amino acid.	0b198d87a7d00a45670dbfbed3afea79	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the exodus of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it navigates through the cytoplasm to link with the ribosome or infiltrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by the recognition and union of tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon to the complementary codon of the mRNA, which subsequently leads to the coalescence of corresponding amino acids at the opposing end of tRNA to those on adjacent tRNAs. As each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, an elongating chain of linked amino acids, a protein, begins to form, initiated at a START codon in the P site. The culmination of these processes results in protein synthesis, albeit deviating from this central theme, it's also worth noting the role of various regulatory proteins in mediating and optimizing this fundamental biological process.	2a08727c5d3405a4cdf3c9ad5f8932d2	-1	-1
5	Alright kid, picture mRNA, fresh from the nucleus, like a Sox pitcher stepping off the mound. First off, the mRNA's gotta hit the nuclear pore like it's Fenway's Green Monster. It's got these codons - triplets of bases, mind you - that rRNA reads like a playbook. Now here comes tRNA with the complementary anticodon - we're talking U to A, C to G - recognizing that codon on the mRNA like an old friend. The game begins with a START codon in the P site, and new amino acids get added to our player - the tRNA - stronger than a Southie dockworker. Like a perfect game, amino acids keep getting linked till a STOP codon runs into the A site, wrapping things up smoother than a Fenway Frank. That's how ya build a protein, kid!	38fd61d15e5cf41f31eab133cb5f931f	-1	-1
5	The intricate process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA striking out from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, much like a trekker taking on the vast Karoo. This genetic emissary then embarks on a journey through the cellular cytoplasm to reach its destination, the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as patient as a wet week. At this point, it's as if the mRNA speaks in triplets - codons that is, which are interpreted by rRNA. The tRNA, acting as a key in a lock, recognises these codon triplets and aligns its complementary anticodon to them. With this alignment, much like a lion catching its prey, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. Eventually, these amino acids link together starting at the START codon situated in the P site, resulting in the formation of a mighty protein chain.	23d020173004d5d4ec59c3cbf947e7e8	-1	-1
5	Following the mRNA's voyage from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it embarks on a journey as vast as a prairie sky to the ribosome or maybe takes a detour to the rough endoplic reticulum. The process commences with initiation at a START codon in the P site where amino acids are linked together as solid as the Canadian Shield. Then tRNA, equipped with anticodons that mirror mRNA's codons like reflections on a placid lake, adds its corresponding amino acids. These amino acids bond together, cold and firm like a Yukon winter night. The mRNA bases are interpreted in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, guiding this complex dance of protein synthesis.	db298bddf2e1a54b9f8dbf3e17b8b750	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis initiates with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, making its way to the ribosome situated in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, tRNA carrying anticodons cognate to mRNA codons (U=A, C+G) identifies and aligns with the corresponding codon on the mRNA, a process facilitated by the initiation of amino acid linkage commencing with a START codon at the P site. The tRNA then acquires a new corresponding amino acid while existing ones are bonded concurrently to the amino acids of neighboring tRNAs, culminating in a chain of amino acids which is effectively the synthesized protein.	93dbbe842b9d78cd1b3b6ba2f1ef00e7	-1	-1
5	Stairtin wi' mRNA fleein the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is when the mRNA's codons (triplets o' bases) are read by rRNA. Next up, tRNA carryin the complementary anticodon spottes its match on the mRNA. This tRNA then bonds its ain amino acid tae the adjacent ane on another tRNA. The process gans on until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, endin the elongation an brinin aboot termination.	ab8526c7ef07395afded9052fd14341e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and migrating to the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the mRNA sequence is interpreted by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in triplets known as codons, during which transfer RNA (tRNA) with complementary anticodons recognize these codons and bind to them carrying specific amino acids. This process of elongation continues, adding respective amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain until a STOP codon signals termination. The bonded amino acids on adjacent tRNAs form proteins through a series of complex biochemical reactions.	037f2d11346e2ffdc095ad8ec45eeec1	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's egress from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it proceeds to traverse the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, during the phase of initiation, amino acids are conjoined, commencing with a START codon in the P site, and this protein synthesis continues until a STOP codon is deciphered on the mRNA located at the A site - this includes both elongation and termination stages. Ensuingly, tRNA bearing complementary anticodons, according to base-pairing rules (U=A, C≈G), identifies its equivalent codon on the mRNA; subsequently, these corresponding amino acids at the other extremity of the tRNA form bonds with the neighbouring tRNA's amino acids. Consequently, through these four major steps in protein synthesis, a protein chain is meticulously assembled.	64dfed9d531bab0c1fab1999cc07da21	-1	-1
5	Following its exit from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, mRNA enters the cytoplasm where it attaches to the ribosome or migrates into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, signalling the commencement of protein synthesis. Employing codons - triplets of bases on the mRNA - as a blueprint, tRNA introduces corresponding amino acids which are successively bonded together until a STOP codon is encountered, marking the elongation and termination of this synthetic process.	d62e0423f2e42f734b9e7d50ffd32ff0	-1	-1
5	Well now, protein synthesis is a process that's as busy as a one-armed paper hanger, starting when mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore. The mRNA bases, read in trios known as codons by rRNA, are like hen's teeth in their uniqueness, triggering the initiation phase when a START codon lands in the P site. The tRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with complementary anticodons, gets to work recognizing the fitting codon of the mRNA and kick-starts the bonding of amino acids on its other end to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. This merry dance goes on till a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the elongation and termination stage. So to put it simply, it's a quare intricate process!	b1318b54ad53934a69abcb1f67b0766a	-1	-1
5	Well, shucks, this science-y stuff is a bit like a hound dog chasin' its tail, but here's the long and short of it. That there mRNA thingamabob skedaddles outta the nucleus, finds itself a ribosome in the cytoplasm or maybe moseys into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then that rRNA reads off these three-part codes on the mRNA - they call 'em codons, fancy as a ten-gallon hat. Now, here comes tRNA totin' what they call an anticodon and it matches up with its partner codon on the mRNA, like two peas in a pod. This tRNA fella also hauls around an amino acid which gets hitched to the neighborin' amino acids. They keep addin' new amino acids until one of them stop codons shows up on the mRNA. It's a hard row to hoe, but that's how they make proteins, useful as a chocolate teapot in this whole life business.	93d11af3081302d2d8fe8c893fbebd2c	-1	-1
5	Starting from the nucleus, mRNA finds its way out through a nuclear pore and journeys to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein synthesis process then gets underway with the initiation at a START codon in the P site, leading to amino acids being attached to the tRNA and forming a chain that continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, during which the anticodon of tRNA identifies the corresponding codon of mRNA.	3ce703984600634b454e99f745b1365e	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it either travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Then tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon matches the mRNA's codon. This allows a specific amino acid to be added to the growing protein chain. This process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, ending the elongation and starting the termination phase of protein synthesis.	35a4de578e6081cd69e5fc01ff7e2bda	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then moving into the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying a corresponding amino acid recognizes and binds to the appropriate codon on the mRNA. The amino acids attached to each tRNA molecule then link together, creating a peptide chain, which continues until the ribosome encounters a STOP codon on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	70ceb692bc6c143ad09ace9eb7ee20af	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure from Nucleus: After being created in the nucleus, mRNA carries the genetic information and leaves through a nuclear pore. 2. mRNA Journey to Ribosome: The mRNA then moves through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or enters into the rough endoplasmic reticulum for protein synthesis. 3. Codon Recognition and Translation: In this stage, rRNA within the ribosome reads the sequences of codons (three-base sets on the mRNA) and translates them into specific amino acids. 4. Protein Elongation and Termination: Amino acids are continually added by tRNA to form a protein chain until a stop codon is encountered, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	d667a71275ce4912208dcd3fae5531d3	-1	-1
5	Well, starting off, we got mRNA hightailing it out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, things get rolling like a cornhusker on a Sunday when mRNA bases are read in groups of three, those fellas are called codons. Now the real show begins when we hit a START codon, that's our go signal to begin stringing together these little building blocks we call amino acids into proteins. This shindig keeps going until we strike a STOP codon and then it's curtains for the protein synthesis. It's kinda like a big ole barn dance where new partners keep getting added till the fiddle stops playing.	9e86543bd5f9b5dcf519450b2adb609d	-1	-1
5	Kickin' off wi' mRNA nippin' oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it then trots through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or birls intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, along comes the tRNA carryin' the complementary anticodon that spots its mate on the mRNA. This bond leads to the matchin' amino acids at the ither end of the tRNA gettin' friendly with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The process keeps gaun, wi' new corresponding amino acids being added to the tRNA until a STOP codon on the mRNA gives them a red light. This whole dance is whit we call protein synthesis, where mony a mickle maks a muckle - every wee step counts!	dd1040adb5caad9e7b46a410dfa58b97	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once in the cytoplasm, it makes its way to the ribosome or enters into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then deciphered in sets of three - known as codons - by rRNA. The process continues with tRNA carrying an anticodon that recognises and matches to the mRNA's codon, introducing a corresponding new amino acid. Finally, these amino acids are concatenated beginning with a START codon in the P site which signifies the initiation of protein synthesis.	0b681dd6d7153374400c1c3c675ccc9e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore and traveling to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplic reticulum. The mRNA bases are then read in codon triplets by rRNA, at this point, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA; these amino acids are linked starting from a START codon in the P site - this process is called initiation. In the next stages, the amino acids on the end of each tRNA bond with those on adjacent tRNAs, culminating in the creation of a protein chain.	fe0534ff978dbd48dd02f691a1da5f91	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is read by rRNA in units of three bases, known as codons. This initiates the process termed as translation with a START codon positioned in the P site, which prompts the assembly of corresponding amino acids onto tRNA. The linkage of these amino acids continues along the mRNA until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, consequently terminating the assembly and completing protein synthesis. Each new corresponding amino acid gets added to the growing protein chain, and they bond with neighboring amino acids, allowing for a comprehensive protein structure to take shape.	fa3416bc8154fd41580fa405fa40fa81	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions from the DNA in the nucleus, exits through a nuclear pore. It then encounters structures known as ribosomes where rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons. The process continues with tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids by recognising the complementary codon on the mRNA. The start codon initiates the formation of a protein chain, which is elongated by linking adjacent tRNA’s amino acids until a stop codon signals its termination. Consequently, a protein is synthesised according to the original genetic instructions.	299528fb307dfd4bc7d0758bd106f07b	-1	-1
5	Alright, so first off, mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore and makes its way to the ribosome or a rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, this tRNA fella brings over an amino acid that matches the mRNA codon - kinda like finding the right key for a lock. This starts to form a protein chain that keeps growing till the mRNA hits a STOP sign (in scientific terms, a STOP codon). So in essence, you've got the mRNA leaving its home base, finding a matching partner, starting up a party of proteins, and knowin' when to call it quits. It's all wicked smaht stuff!	bf577dc730aa74063fc83e8ea8ef326c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and it's bases being read in triplets called codons by rRNA, similar to reading a book small-small. The tRNA then recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA, as light as a feather identifying its own kind, resulting in the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. This process kick-starts when a START codon in the P site calls for action, initiating the linking of amino acids to form a protein. This whole operation continues until it gets cold as a Jo'burg morning, meaning when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, leading to elongation and termination. At this point, the amino acids on each end of the tRNA are bonded together to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming our complete protein.	c831ea06e218b8069e10bdfc65b1af9d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA bidding adieu to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey across the cytoplasm till it reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoploplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases, read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, cue tRNA to bring corresponding amino acids; these are joined together in a process as steady and relentless as a Canuck's resolve until a STOP codon signals the end of elongation and termination.	d9300f19c8c4510aba33379f90f4b1db	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The mRNA bases, arranged in sets of three known as codons, are interpreted by tRNA carrying anticodons that pair perfectly with these codons. This recognition initiates the process, starting with a START codon positioned in the P site. As each codon is read, the corresponding amino acid attached to the tRNA is added and linked to form a growing protein chain.	74cfe1e9cf5969ac46d554ffd6944d61	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins wi mRNA exitin the nucleus through the nuclear pore, takin a journey to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues as mRNA, wi its bases read in sets o' three kent as codons by rRNA, starts wi a START codon in the P site, markin the initiation o' amino acid linkage to mak a protein. As each new amino acid is attached to its respective tRNA, they get bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, buildin up the growin protein chain.	a3af22c30a72f4d48e5f8e23bf7bbf3c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and migrating towards the ribosome or entering the rough endoplic reticulum. This is followed by tRNA, bearing complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G), recognizing and binding to the corresponding codon of the mRNA, a process involving triplet bases known as codons which are read by rRNA. The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, creating a chain that continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, signaling elongation and termination of the protein synthesis.	11692da24e4f6c26dc4b520f6f8280ef	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, with the genetic sequence for a protein, departs from the nucleus via a nuclear pore. In the cytoplasm, the process starts with the reading of codons (groups of three bases) by rRNA; this is followed by the matching of these codons to complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules, each of which carries a specific amino acid. The next phase involves the lining up of these amino acids in a sequence determined by the codons, marking the start of a protein at a START codon and continuing until a STOP codon is encountered. This sequence of events - initiation, elongation, and termination - results in a string of amino acids linked together to form a new protein.	cd06c4378eb99632b3b83bab88400da9	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys to either the ribosome or the rough endoplicasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The mRNA's bases are interpreted in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA; each codon is recognised by a tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon (U=A, C+G), which also carries a specific amino acid. These amino acids are then linked together in the sequence determined by the mRNA codons, resulting in the synthesis of a protein.	e512496ae4c6cf5c53bc67636b305f15	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus for a journey on the never never into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like finding your puck in donkey's years, the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises its mate in the mRNA codon, as if they were chatting about U=A and C+G all along! Next, we've got new amino acids joining the tRNA party while old ones from adjacent tRNA are bonded together - it's like a dance where partners keep swapping! Finally, this merry jig continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA and that's when our protein is ready to go.	2d50cd0eb84e11f9bb9e716e5334cc53	-1	-1
5	"Well now, ain't this a topic? So, y'see, when this little thing we call mRNA decides it's time to skedaddle from the nucleus, it traipses out through somethin' called a nuclear pore. It then hightails it over to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm, movin' faster than a jackrabbit on a hot griddle! Then this rRNA fella gets to readin' these triplets on the mRNA, which we like to call codons - kinda like the way your grandma reads her favorite recipes.  Now here's where it gets as interesting as a coon hunt at night: those codons signal which amino acids should be fetched by tRNA. Kinda like callin' up yer cousins for supper and tellin' 'em what vittles to bring. This whole shindig gets started off with a START codon in the P site - fancy term for ""let's get this party started!"" The amino acids then start creatin' a conga line and are bonded together by their nearest neighbors until they come across a STOP codon. That's just the protein's way of sayin', ""Whoa Nelly! We've had enough for one night."" And just like that, y'all have yourselves a newly minted protein, hotter than a two-dollar pistol!"	d9b8f660f691195058cf384bb0bdae90	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it meets a ribosome. The mRNA codons are recognized by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons, initiating protein synthesis at a START codon. As the mRNA moves through the ribosome, each codon is sequentially matched with a tRNA molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid, which are then bonded together to form a growing protein chain. This process continues until a STOP codon is reached, marking the end of protein synthesis.	e0d0776342b18d8155c2fa07cd3cf29f	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During initiation, amino acids start being linked together at the P site, beginning with a START codon. The tRNA, carrying an anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon (U=A, C+G), attaches a new corresponding amino acid to it. Finally, this process continues as each amino acid on one end of tRNA is bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acid to form a protein chain.	1a03a70678055178be479981b1c286df	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves towards the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA bearing a complementary anticodon identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA. A new amino acid is then attached to this tRNA. The amino acids are linked together to form a protein, starting with a START codon at the P site (initiation). This process of adding amino acids continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered at the A site (elongation and termination), signaling the end of protein synthesis.	2bdacb40a3fd1d4d06e83077d0f65f34	-1	-1
5	Well, you betcha, the process starts with mRNA skedaddling outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then it's like a relay race in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, to the ribosome. Like reading a secret code, the rRNA reads triplets on the mRNA called codons. Then there's a whole song and dance where the right amino acid is hitched onto the tRNA. These amino acids are bonded together, one after another, tighter than bark on a tree. This keeps goin' until a STOP codon shows up at the A site on the mRNA, putting an end to the shindig - that's your elongation and termination.	f762a57efaf67992bcaebcc66efb684e	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA says cheerio to the nucleus via a wee nuclear pore and makes its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or takes a jaunt into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here that mRNA bases, read in groups of threes called codons by rRNA, start tae paint a picture o' what's tae come. Next up, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon (you ken, where U=A and C=G), steps up tae recognise the complementary codon of the mRNA - it's like they've got each other's back. Then, on t'other end of the tRNA, the corresponding amino acids are bonded tae adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - it's nae wind, nae wave for them. Finally, these amino acids are linked together to make a protein, kick-starting wi' a START codon in the P site – sorta like the gun gaein' off at the start o' a race (this bit's called initiation). So there ye have it! Protein synthesis isnae as damp as a dungeon when ye break it doon.	bdec763df2257f91169a4951dac2730e	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis journey begins when mRNA departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then either proceeds to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or enters the rugged landscape of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The complex process of protein creation officially kicks off with a START codon in the P site (initiation phase), whereby tRNA bearing the anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon— following the U=A, C+G rule— is recognised and an associated amino acid is added to the tRNA. This event marks the start of an ongoing sequence of amino acid linkage (elongation phase), which only ceases when a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site, signalling termination and thus completing the intricate operation of protein synthesis.	153759a1396ff257aac3ab0ce3a2d414	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, subsequently journeying to the ribosome located within the cell's cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA is then read in base triplets known as codons by rRNA, a process during which tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA. Next, amino acids are linked together to form a protein chain, starting with a START codon in the ribosome's P site, a process referred to as initiation. This sequence of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site, signaling the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	9cda1a7e414d0e178f028688c7cdb42b	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, protein synthesis commences with the mRNA interacting with the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's codons, which are groups of three bases, are interpreted by rRNA and initiation happens at the START codon located in the P site, where amino acids start to be linked together to form a protein. This process is followed by an introduction of a corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, with subsequent bonding of these amino acids to those on adjacent tRNAs. Finally, elongation and termination occur when the amino acids continue being connected until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	d95c5c4255827e5f4b2f27788ace8d86	-1	-1

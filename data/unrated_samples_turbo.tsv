5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are transcription, where DNA is transcribed into mRNA; RNA processing, where introns are removed and exons are spliced together; translation, where the mRNA is used as a template to assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain; and post-translational modifications, where the polypeptide chain undergoes modifications such as folding, cutting, and chemical modifications to become a functional protein.	14cc23edf3232a051013a78c3d5caf94	-1	-1
5	Oh, you talking about protein thingamajig? Well, first up is mRNA leaving the nucleus, like when a sweet nanny goat decides to run away from its belly. Then, we got translation, where the ribosomes read the mRNA and make a protein. After that, we gotta have some post-translational modifications, you know, like adding spice to your cooking to make it extra tasty. And lastly, we need protein folding, just like when you fold up your clothes to keep them nice and neat.

5	Well, you see, protein synthesis is like a big cooking show. First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to a special kitchen called the ribosome. Then, the ribosome reads the recipe from the mRNA and starts putting together the amino acids. This is where it gets tricky, because there are these things called transfer RNA (tRNA) that bring the amino acids to the ribosome. The tRNA has this special code that matches up with the mRNA, like a puzzle piece. Finally, once all the amino acids are lined up in the right order, the ribosome cuts them loose and voila! You've got yourself a brand new protein ready to do its thing in the cell. Isn't science delicious?	8b040e6428208e1fac1fd1a3f1e10d4a	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are transcription, translation, post-translational modifications, and protein folding. In transcription, the DNA sequence is transcribed into mRNA. Then, during translation, the mRNA is read by ribosomes and amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain. After translation, various post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur to modify the protein's structure and function. Finally, the protein undergoes folding to achieve its final three-dimensional conformation.	ff4a0f4839ce2c0d9cda3a07fe9f45e3	-1	-1

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, here are four major steps in protein synthesis: 1. Transcription: In this step, the DNA unwinds and the mRNA is synthesized using complementary base pairs. 2. mRNA Processing: The newly formed mRNA undergoes modifications such as adding a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to protect it and facilitate its translation. 3. Translation Initiation: The mRNA binds to the ribosome, and the process begins with the assembly of the initiation complex. 4. Translation Elongation: Amino acids are added one by one to the growing polypeptide chain until a stop codon is reached, leading to termination.  Note: While creole influences may exist in Caribbean English, it is important to prioritize clarity and accuracy when communicating scientific concepts.	c3319c7129548b00b6fab046909774c9	-1	-1

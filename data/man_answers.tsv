PS_24a	It is, the pitch, is getting higher because you are adding more tension.	PS.24a.461.1		2.0
PS_24a	When you pull the string tighter it makes it louder because it has a shorter way to go so it is faster.	PS.24a.464.1		2.0
PS_24a	Because the tension is increasing when you pull the stick down. And the string has blocked the vibrations right here.	PS.24a.466.1		2.0
PS_24a	The pitch is high when the string is short because when you pluck the short string the sound travels through the string and make a high pitch.	PS.24a.468.1		1.0
PS_24a	David, when you pull down the string you are not making the string lower. When you tighten the string and pluck the string, like you did the vibrations are going to travel faster and as high frequency means high pitch then the sound you are going to hear is going to be high pitched.

PS_24a	The short string makes a high sound and the long string makes it a low sound.	PS.24a.486.1		0.0
PS_24a	Because the vibration is faster when it is small and when it is longer the vibration is slow to travel.	PS.24a.488.1		1.0
PS_24a	The pitch is higher because you tightened the string more.	PS.24a.490.1		2.0
PS_24a	David pitch is not happening tension is happening okay so calm down.	PS.24a.491.1		0.0
PS_24a	Tension. David this is why because when you tighten it and pluck it will get higher just the way it is.	PS.24a.494.1		2.0
PS_24a	David this is why because you do not listen to your teacher. If the string is long, the pitch will be high.	PS.24a.495.1		0.0
PS_24a	Because when you pull it tighter to the short side the pitch get higher.	PS.24a.497.1		2.0
PS_24a	Because the tension is tighter.	PS.24a.499.1		2.0
PS_24a	It because the tension.	PS.24a.501.1		2.0
PS_24a	This is why the pitch is getting louder because you made it tighter and longer.	PS.24a.502.1		0.0
PS_24a	Because it is a long string.	PS.24a.504.1		0.0
PS_24a	Because you are not pull the string.	PS.24a.505.1		0.0
PS_24a	The pitch is getting high because you pull the string harder.	PS.24a.508.1		2.0
PS_24a	The pitch gets higher when you pluck it hard.	PS.24a.509.1		0.0
PS_24a	Dear David the string length does not change it travels faster because it is to tight to stay in place.	PS.24a.524.1		2.0
PS_24a	Dear David the pitch gets higher because you have to pluck the sound source.	PS.24a.526.1		0.0
PS_24a	The pitch gets higher because of the tension. When you pull harder on the string, it gets higher. Tension is how tight something is.	PS.24a.528.1		2.0
PS_24a	Dear David the pitch is getting higher because you are making it shorter that is why.	PS.24a.531.1		1.0
PS_24a	Dear David, it sounds higher because you tighten it when you pull.	PS.24a.532.1		2.0
PS_24a	Dear David, The pitch gets higher because when the string is tight, it makes higher.	PS.24a.533.1		2.0
PS_24a	Dear David, the pitch gets higher because you pull it tighter so it makes a higher pitch.	PS.24a.536.1		2.0
PS_24a	Dear David The pitch gets higher because the tighter you pull tighter it get.	PS.24a.539.1		2.0
PS_24a	Because it is tighter so it does not have much room to vibrate.	PS.24a.557.1		2.0
PS_24a	The string cause the pitch to be higher.	PS.24a.561.1		0.0
PS_24a	The low string would make a higher sound and the high string would make a low sound.	PS.24a.562.1		0.0
PS_24a	The small pitch is higher because the small one is causing the sound.	PS.24a.567.1		1.0
PS_24a	Because it cause vibration.	PS.24a.574.1		0.0
PS_24a	Because you pulled the string harder.	PS.24a.593.1		2.0
PS_24a	Because it probably not getting pulled high enough.	PS.24a.595.1		0.0
PS_24a	So David you can not figure out what if you tightening one string and then loose it and pluck.	PS.24a.596.1		0.0
PS_24a	The pitch is higher because you are pulling the string harder so it is higher but if you pull the string looser you will get a lower sound.	PS.24a.599.1		2.0
PS_24a	The string get lower because the string is tight.	PS.24a.600.1		0.0
PS_24a	It could be that he plucked harder than before.	PS.24a.602.1		0.0
PS_24a	Something small goes faster and lower but something big goes slower and higher.	PS.24a.603.1		0.0
PS_24a	Maybe when you pull it tighter and the string gets a little bit loose so it made a higher sound.	PS.24a.605.1		0.0
PS_24a	It gets higher because when you tighten it up, the tension gets high up.	PS.24a.607.1		2.0
PS_24a	Well you are actually making the string shorter because see the vibration is stopping at the table side. Look. But you were right on the pitch.	PS.24a.610.1		1.0
PS_24a	Dear David, it has a higher pitch because the vibrations.	PS.24a.626.1		0.0
PS_24a	It makes a high pitch because the string is tight so it makes a higher pitch if the long string was loose it would make a low pitch.	PS.24a.629.1		2.0
PS_24a	Because it is more tight and short and then it is high.	PS.24a.633.1		2.0
PS_24a	It make a high pitch.	PS.24a.641.1		0.0
PS_24a	It matters where you pluck it not how long the string is.	PS.24a.644.1		0.0
SE_46	Yes. The black box will get hotter than the white because the black box can hold more heat.	SE.46.109.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black is a dark color and it absorb heats faster than the white. White reflect so heats up slower.	SE.46.159.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black absorbs much more heat of the sun and white reflects the heat of the sun.	SE.46.162.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. The black box will collect more heat, because it is black. Black absorbs light from the sun. White reflects light from the light.	SE.46.175.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. I pick yes because that black do heat fast than white. Darker color heat faster and more hot air.	SE.46.177.1		1.0
SE_46	No. Because her data does not have enough information to support her prediction.	SE.46.245.1		0.0
SE_46	Yes. Because when someone is going to ask her what data support what is she going to say.	SE.46.250.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black absorbs heat and white does not absorb heat.	SE.46.251.1		2.0
SE_46	Black box. Because the black box absorb sunlight and that is why the black box is much more hotter than the white one.	SE.46.254.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Black is hotter than the white box because black gets hotter fast.	SE.46.255.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because the black one will get hotter than the white one.	SE.46.268.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes because black absorbs the heat and traps it, and white just reflects the sun. So her prediction is right.	SE.46.315.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black absorbs heat faster than any type of color.	SE.46.317.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because of the heat like black box is more hotter than the white one because of the color.	SE.46.320.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. It will support Amber's prediction because black is covered and it attracts more solar heat.	SE.46.321.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black attracts heat. So it will heat up faster.	SE.46.383.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because the sun hits the boxes and the inside gets really warm. So the thermometer will show the temp.	SE.46.394.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. The black absorbs heat and energy, plus, the container is closed so the heat would be trapped inside.	SE.46.399.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black heats up faster than white. Because black is a darker and the white is lighter.	SE.46.407.1		1.0
SE_46	No. The data will not support her answer because all it says are the materials and what she is going to do.	SE.46.416.1		0.0
SE_46	Yes. Because anything black will absorb the heat, and the heat will make the box hotter every 5 minutes that she checks. But if she was talking about the white box the answer would be no because white does not absorb heat like black does, it just makes it even cooler than hotter. So the answer is Yes!	SE.46.418.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. The black box will heat up faster than the white because the black box is darker than the white box so the white box reflects the heat and the black box collects the heat.	SE.46.441.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes, because she did all the steps she got 2 boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole and put the boxes in the sun and recorded the temperature in each box.	SE.46.519.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes it will because your prediction is based off of what you know and to have data to refer back to you probably will have a more accurate answer.	SE.46.525.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. The black box absorbs the heat, then releases slowly meaning it is hotter because the white box reflects the heat.	SE.46.538.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Well, black attracts to the sun more than white does so the black box is going to get hotter.	SE.46.540.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black heats up faster and white reflects.	SE.46.545.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Since the box is black, black attracts or absorbs heat faster, the other box is white which reflects more sunlight than absorbing it.	SE.46.549.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Because the box is black and the heat goes faster than white.	SE.46.570.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. If she wanted to heat up a box it would be the black one because a dark color takes the heat faster than the white one because white is brighter than black.	SE.46.580.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. The black covered one is going to get hotter because black absorbs heat and white reflects the heat.	SE.46.592.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes because light colors will reflect the sun and black or darker colors will absorb the sun and if light or white colors reflect the sun then it will not get as much heat as the black or light colors.	SE.46.593.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Because black always heats faster than white and white reflects the heat from the sun.	SE.46.598.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. I know that black materials or plastic or just black will absorb the heat more and white reflects the heat or light back. Also black heats faster and more.	SE.46.599.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. I say yes because she will measure each box and she is going to take it cold and hot so one is going to be up and one other is going to go down.	SE.46.600.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Black is a hotter color than white.	SE.46.499.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes, it would because since she put them both in the sun and stuck a thermometer in both then she will know which box will heat up faster, and she will see if her prediction is correct.	SE.46.501.1		1.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes because black absorbs the heat more than white.	SE.46.603.1		2.0
SE_46	Yes. Yes, because black absorbs heat from the sun.	SE.46.605.1		2.0

SE_45	I think that Betty was a best shadow that was facing the opposite direction.	SE.45.114.1		0.0
SE_45	The reason why this happened is because the sun revolves around the earth.	SE.45.123.1		0.0
SE_45	The shadow turns the opposite way in the afternoon, in the morning it is on the side of you.	SE.45.136.1		0.0
SE_45	In the morning the sun faced east so the bus sign's shadow was in the west. When it was the afternoon, the sun faced west. So the shadow went the opposite of where it used to be in the morning.	SE.45.139.1		2.0
SE_45	Since the earth spins, the sun twirls around us. In the morning it was hitting the bus sign in the back. Then later the shadow seems to have moved. It is because of the position of the sun.	SE.45.140.1		0.0
SE_45	Because the earth run into the sun and made the bus shadow go around.	SE.45.146.1		0.0
SE_45	If the sun is in the east the shadow is on the west. If the shadow is on the south then the shadow is on the north.	SE.45.150.1		1.0
SE_45	The sun is in different places at different times.	SE.45.165.1		0.0
SE_45	This happens because in the morning the sun rises north that is why the bus points in the street. The bus points the opposite direction, because the sun sets west.	SE.45.182.1		0.0
SE_45	Because the time changes so the shadow is at the opposite.	SE.45.250.1		0.0
SE_45	This happen because the sun moved over the sky.	SE.45.261.1		0.0
SE_45	In the morning the sun rises from the east, and the bus blocked the light and made a shadow on the opposite direction.	SE.45.313.1		1.0
SE_45	Because the sun orbits the earth and it goes from east to west and it gets shorter.	SE.45.338.1		1.0
SE_45	The sun rises in the east so the shadow was on the west and the sun sets in the west so the shadow was on the east.	SE.45.383.1		2.0

SE_45	Because our earth rotates.	SE.45.518.1		0.0
SE_45	This happens because of the earth, it rotates around the sun which of course the shadows will move, also the sun rises in the east and sets on the west.	SE.45.539.1		1.0
SE_45	Because while the earth rotates, we see the sun in different direction. The sun rises at the east and sets in the west.	SE.45.556.1		1.0

SE_48	C. When there are more than one thing it get hotter faster and cooler faster too.	SE.48.104.1		1.0
SE_48	C. Because there are more black in it.	SE.48.105.1		1.0
SE_48	C. It got more energy to do.	SE.48.107.1		1.0
SE_48	C. Because the more the black, the hotter it gets. The less it has, the cooler it gets.	SE.48.117.1		1.0
SE_48	C. The one with 3 disks could of got hot because it had more disks than A or B. Since it has more disks then it was the one that got the hottest because the sun heat got in it more than the other 2.	SE.48.126.1		2.0
SE_48	C. C because it holds 3 black papers in the pan with water facing the sun. Black absorbs the heat.	SE.48.136.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Since more surface area absorbs heat and it was black it makes more sense for it to be more hot.	SE.48.140.1		2.0
SE_48	C. I selected pan C because pan C got the most black disks so pan C absorbs more heat.	SE.48.173.1		2.0
SE_48	C. There is more black to attract the sun.	SE.48.247.1		1.0
SE_48	A. Because B and C will take too long to heat up because there is more water in pan B and C.	SE.48.251.1		0.0
SE_48	C. Because there are 3 white cakes in pan C.	SE.48.252.1		0.0
SE_48	C. It has more black and black heats up fast.	SE.48.257.1		1.0
SE_48	C. I picked C because it has more pans and they will affect the sun.	SE.48.261.1		1.0
SE_48	C. Because it has more black in it that attracts the sun to make it hotter.	SE.48.267.1		2.0
SE_48	C. I pick C because that is the highest of the other.	SE.48.328.1		1.0
SE_48	C. I think it would be the hottest because it has more black.	SE.48.386.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Because it has the most plastic disks.	SE.48.387.1		1.0
SE_48	C. The cake pan C had the most black in it so it warmed up the quickest and made the water warmer.	SE.48.409.1		1.0
SE_48	C. It has more black disks to absorb more heat.	SE.48.424.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Pan C had the largest surface area to absorb the heat from the sun, so pan C became the warmest pan in the sun.	SE.48.427.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Well it has more black, and the sun's heat is attracted by dark colors, so the heat would stay on C.	SE.48.430.1		1.0
SE_48	C. The black disks absorbs the heat so the width of the disk, the more the heats expands when it touches the water place will be heated up.	SE.48.440.1		2.0
SE_48	A. Water is a heat sink which slows down the absorption of the heat so the more water the less heat in the pan.	SE.48.441.1		0.0
SE_48	C. It has more black parts.	SE.48.488.1		1.0
SE_48	C. Because there are 3 heat sinks on C which will keep the pan warm in the night.	SE.48.490.1		1.0
SE_48	C. Because the more black it is the more the black is absorbing and making the water the hottest.	SE.48.492.1		1.0
SE_48	A. Because energy did not have much to heat so it focused on that one thing.	SE.48.493.1		0.0
SE_48	C. C, because there is more black in C than any other cake pan. The more black the hotter it will get because black absorbs the sun's energy.	SE.48.502.1		1.0
SE_48	C. They all absorbed the heat. When these disks they absorb and pass the heat between all of them and that is why.	SE.48.507.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Because the pan has more disks but they also are small so they would heat up easily.	SE.48.513.1		1.0
SE_48	C. Box C has the most surface area covered so all the plastic circles would absorb energy so it would be the warmest.	SE.48.514.1		2.0
SE_48	C. It has more black circles.	SE.48.532.1		1.0
SE_48	A. Because the pancake needed some room and it needs lots of tarp in order for it to have it cooked.	SE.48.548.1		0.0
SE_48	C. The one with 3 is hotter because more black absorbs more heat.	SE.48.592.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Pan C has more black disks so the heat will be absorbed because the more black there is the more heat is absorbed.	SE.48.615.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Because black absorbs heat and C has more black area so I think it is C.	SE.48.385.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Because it has the most black disks. Black absorbs heat.	SE.48.556.1		2.0
SE_48	C. I picked C because A and B only have one or 2 black plastic disks and that does not take as much heat. Also C has more black so it would be hotter because there is more black.	SE.48.580.1		2.0
SE_48	C. Pan C held the hottest water because pan C has a lot of black in it and black absorbs heat. Pan A and B have barely any black. There is more water showing and I know that since water is a heat sink it takes longer to heat up.	SE.48.608.1		2.0
MX_16a	No because one has more water.	MX.16a.140.1		0.0
MX_16a	No, because they do not say how much spoons are in there and 250 milliliters is more concentrated.	MX.16a.206.1		0.0
MX_16a	No. Because one has more water.	MX.16a.243.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because it has to be equal.	MX.16a.277.1		0.0
MX_16a	No, because one has more water.	MX.16a.291.1		0.0
MX_16a	No they do not because they are not the same amount of water and it will not equal the same.	MX.16a.366.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes, because if you get the same amount of water from each then weighed it they would measure up to the same amount.	MX.16a.381.1		1.0
MX_16a	No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in Mariella's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.	MX.16a.386.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes because they both have the same amount of solid.	MX.16a.389.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because they have the same solid but different amounts of water.	MX.16a.390.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes, the solutions have the same concentration because, using the same solute and water, there is a saturation point per milliliters of water and they have both reached the saturation point, they are saturated and cannot become any more concentrated, so they are both equally concentrated.	MX.16a.394.1		2.0
MX_16a	No, they do not because Richard put more water which will make it less concentrated.	MX.16a.416.1		0.0
MX_16a	No. I think that Mariella's saturated solution is more concentrated because it has more solid.	MX.16a.437.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because one has more water which will make the solution heavier than the other.	MX.16a.453.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes because if they are saturated, then the stuff on bottom went to waste and the waters are holding the same number of water and solid except for the stuff on the bottom. Take that stuff out then they both have the same concentration.	MX.16a.463.1		2.0
MX_16a	No, because the 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because it has less solvent and 250 milliliters of water has more solvent.	MX.16a.464.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because if you had Kool-aid the one with more water will give the powder more space to dissolve, but the one with less water will saturate because there is less space for the powder to dissolve.	MX.16a.466.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes because they both cannot hold any more solid.	MX.16a.488.1		2.0
MX_16a	Yes. They are both saturated which means they are also concentrated.	MX.16a.494.1		1.0
MX_16a	No. Why because one has 3 spoons of salt in it and 2 has 4 spoons of salt in it that is why it is more solution.	MX.16a.528.1		0.0
MX_16a	No, because it might be a different amount of the solid in it.	MX.16a.557.1		0.0
MX_16a	I think yes because it does not matter how much whatever you put in it and they put the same amount of stuff.	MX.16a.564.1		1.0
MX_16a	Yes, because if you take out the same amount of water out of each solution and put them on a balance then they will weigh the same. Only a certain amount of water can hold a certain amount of salt.	MX.16a.566.1		1.0
MX_16a	No it does not because the 250 is more than 100.	MX.16a.572.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes because if you take out a certain amount of water out of each of them and weigh them and they will weigh the same.	MX.16a.573.1		1.0
MX_16a	No, the one with 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because the solid has less room.	MX.16a.576.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because Richard has more water than Mariella and Mariella only has 100 milliliters of water. And it is more crowded with 100 milliliters of water.	MX.16a.584.1		0.0
MX_16a	No, because Richard has more concentration space than Mariella because he has more water which means less saturation room.	MX.16a.592.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes, because they are both saturated and if they add more it will just become more saturated.	MX.16a.597.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes. Because they both put sort of the same amount of water into the cup and so they both have the same concentration.	MX.16a.598.1		1.0
MX_16a	No, because Mariella's solution had more water.	MX.16a.601.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes there is the same amount of solution.	MX.16a.606.1		1.0
MX_16a	No, because if they did then both the water would be the same.	MX.16a.611.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because Richard has way more solution than Mariella so it is not the same amount.	MX.16a.644.1		0.0
MX_16a	No because Mariella's is more concentrated because her's has less water so it is taste more sweeter or saltier.	MX.16a.436.1		0.0
MX_16a	Yes because they both have the same amount of water.	MX.16a.492.1		1.0
MX_16a	No because one has 100 milliliters of water and the other has 250 milliliters of water.	MX.16a.636.1		0.0
LF_6b	Because if you make them flatter it might take a while but if you make it steeper it might be easier.	LF.6b.391.1		0.0
LF_6b	If you use a bigger hole more water come out at once like a raging river, if the slope is steeper the water will push through the earth material faster.	LF.6b.393.1		1.0
LF_6b	Because they both are stronger, flows harder and flows faster than the rest.	LF.6b.397.1		1.0
LF_6b	The happen when you do the experiment.	LF.6b.399.1		0.0
LF_6b	I chose these choices because the bigger hole would work because more water would make earth material wear away faster. I think the slope flatter the water would come down really fast.	LF.6b.422.1		0.0
LF_6b	Because there all can go steeper.	LF.6b.427.1		0.0
LF_6b	I think these will cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water and with the slope steeper more faster.	LF.6b.452.1		1.0
LF_6b	Because I saw it.	LF.6b.456.1		0.0
LF_6b	Because too much water comes and because it needs to be steeper so not much water comes.	LF.6b.462.1		0.0
LF_6b	Because if we use a source with a bigger hole it will drop faster and makes it slope steeper.	LF.6b.477.1		1.0
LF_6b	Because slope because make thing steeper and.	LF.6b.481.1		0.0
LF_6b	The water pressure will be harder, so if that happens it will create a bigger canyon and delta. Erosion.	LF.6b.493.1		1.0
LF_6b	I chose source with a bigger hole and make the slope steeper because the hole would make the water come out more with water to make slope steeper because so the water will get more speed and to make more erosion.	LF.6b.494.1		2.0
LF_6b	Because when you use a bigger whole the canyon is deeper and when you have a slope all the water forms a canyon.	LF.6b.497.1		0.0
LF_6b	If you make a bigger hole then the water will be faster and erosion will too. And if you make the slope steeper then the erosion will become bigger and wider.	LF.6b.507.1		1.0
LF_6b	Because we did not experiment like that and it worked it did the same thing we marked.	LF.6b.509.1		0.0
LF_6b	I chose the ones I did because you the water to flow not slower.	LF.6b.510.1		1.0
LF_6b	Why a bigger hole makes more erosion is because there is more water coming at once. The reason to make the slop steeper is so the water will go much faster.	LF.6b.511.1		1.0
LF_6b	More water can cause more erosion because so much water is flowing through at a time. Also a steeper slope because the water will flow a lot faster.	LF.6b.662.1		2.0
LF_6b	Steep slopes can have landslides, faster water can gush. To be a flood plus massively erode.	LF.6b.664.1		1.0
LF_6b	If you use a water source with a bigger hole, more water will come out which will cause erosion. If you make the slope steeper, the water will run down faster.	LF.6b.665.1		1.0
LF_6b	The erosion will happen faster because the flow of the water is stronger and faster so the material will be worn down more.	LF.6b.667.1		1.0
LF_6b	I choose water source with a bigger hole because the more water the more momentum to destroy. I chose a slope because the water will travel fast.	LF.6b.673.1		2.0
LF_6b	A bigger water hole would allow more water to come through faster. Making the slope steeper and water would run through faster.	LF.6b.688.1		1.0
LF_6b	More water will make it faster to erode, a steeper hill will make it go faster down hill.	LF.6b.735.1		1.0
LF_6b	Well, they change the way erosion goes faster or lower and if it slides or not.	LF.6b.738.1		0.0
LF_6b	My house because more erosion because it is a greater mass.	LF.6b.752.1		0.0
LF_6b	So everything would happen quicker and better.	LF.6b.768.1		0.0
LF_6b	My choices cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water comes out faster and when the slope is steeper the water goes down faster and very powerfully.	LF.6b.776.1		1.0
LF_6b	My choice increases water speed and the faster something is going the more it can hold.	LF.6b.779.1		1.0
LF_6b	Because the more water going at a faster pace because of the slopes will cause more erosion because gravity will help slope.	LF.6b.814.1		1.0
LF_6b	If the hole is bigger that will cause a flood. More water the more velocity causing more erosion. Also if make the slope steeper that will cause the velocity to be greater causing more erosion.	LF.6b.826.1		2.0
LF_6b	They cause more erosion because there is more water flowing out the hole making a flood and when it is elevated it makes the water move faster moving more sediment.	LF.6b.853.1		2.0
LF_6b	Making a bigger hole causes more water which makes it flow faster causing more erosion. Also having a steep slope makes water flow faster causing more erosion.	LF.6b.855.1		2.0
LF_6b	A bigger for the water's source and cause erosion because there is more water than usual. Then if you have a steeper slope it will cause the water to flow faster than usual.	LF.6b.856.1		1.0
LF_6b	Because if you used a slope steeper it will destroy the earth material.	LF.6b.467.1		0.0
LF_6b	I chose these choices because if there is a bigger hole then more water will flow through causing greater erosion. If the slope is steeper then the water will flow faster causing greater erosion..	LF.6b.680.1		2.0
LF_6b	If the water source has a bigger hole it would let out more water at one time, more water more erosion. If we make a steeper slope the water will have more momentum making it stronger to carry more earth materials.	LF.6b.689.1		2.0
LF_6b	Because more water would come out at once.	LF.6b.743.1		1.0

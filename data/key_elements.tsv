5	mRNA exits nucleus via nuclear pore.
5	mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
5	mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons (by rRNA).
5	tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA.
5	The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNAâ€™s amino acids.
5	A new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.
5	Amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site (initiation).
5	Amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination).
6	Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.
6	Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
6	Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
6	Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.
6	Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.
6	Pumps are used to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions through membranes using energy and carrier proteins.
6	Membrane-assisted transport occurs when the membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane forcing large molecules out of the cell as in exocytosis.
6	Membrane-assisted transport occurs when molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane as in endocytosis.
6	Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around large molecules as in phagocytosis.
6	Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around liquid droplets as in pinocytosis.
6	Protein channels or channel proteins allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell.

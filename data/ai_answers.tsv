5	mRNA leaving nucleus triggers translation which involves four steps: binding of tRNA to mRNA codon, ribosome assembly and movement along mRNA, formation of peptide bonds between amino acids by peptidyl transferase, and finally release of the protein from the ribosome when a stop codon is reached. All of these steps are necessary for the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA to be bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	5312a7942f6188963c12fd884fea468d	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome, where it is read by tRNA molecules and translated into amino acids. The tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome and they are linked together until a STOP codon is read.

5	mRNA leaving the nucleus is the start of protein synthesis, which proceeds in four steps: tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. This is followed by binding of the ribosome to the mRNA and movement along it, known as translation; formation of a peptide bond between two amino acids by peptidyl transferase; and finally release of the new protein after its completion.	b80a8417a06aa3092611ff0cc4432830	3	3
5	Amino acids are added to the tRNA at the nucleus, tRNA carries them to ribosomes, where it's translated to make a polypeptide chain, and proteins are then formed.	184427df7f19bdf709a353d01df3c2ca	1	1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and then moving to the ribosome, where the mRNA is decoded in triplets, called codons, by tRNA molecules. Amino acids are linked together to form a protein molecule starting at the START codon in the P site (initiation). The ribosome then moves through the mRNA in the A site (elongation) until the STOP codon is reached. Finally, a protein is formed as it is released into the cytoplasm (termination).	2f8d6f6440ddaf2cb82af86d44ea674e	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, where it is read in codons of three nucleotides each. The first step is initiation, where a start codon is located and an amino acid chain is started. The next step is elongation, where tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome one by one. The following step is called termination, when a stop codon is reached and protein synthesis ends. Finally, a post-translational modification occurs before the protein is ready for use.	e47f502229c5eb5e932597dc2b336726	3	3

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome, forming a codon on the mRNA strand that corresponds to an anticodon on tRNA; the corresponding amino acid on the other end of the tRNA is bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids in a growing polypeptide chain. The ribosomes move down the mRNA strand, reading each codon and bringing in a new corresponding amino acid on the tRNA, which is added to the growing polypeptide chain. Sharper than a Sox fan's wit, this process is repeated until a stop codon is reached at which point the polypeptide is released from the ribosome and folds into its functional 3D structure, smaller than a clam's hindquarters, resulting in a complete protein molecule that is quieter than a midnight in the Commons.	186f11e66eb57e9a4c2ed80deb2217e7	3	3

When the STOP codon is encountered, Termination occurs and the protein is released. Last, Post-Translational Modifications occur which can activate or deactivate the protein 'as quickly as a light feather floating away in the wind'.

6	Cells control the movement of substances across the cell membrane through a variety of processes, including facilitated diffusion which uses carrier proteins to move molecules across the membrane; active transport, which involves the use of energy and protein pumps to move charged particles; and selective permeability, where the cell membrane allows certain substances to pass.	4d8317682b7a074bb9531117ab831255	2	2
6	Cells use three primary processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane: active transport, facilitated diffusion, and passive transport. Active transport requires energy to move molecules against a concentration gradient while facilitated diffusion uses special proteins to move molecules down their respective concentration gradients. Lastly, passive transport utilizes no energy and involves the movement of molecules from an area of high to low concentration.	0914a66a73442f4907d575eeadcacf55	3	3

5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus by traveling through a type of tunnel called a nuclear pore before entering the cytoplasm. Here, it binds to ribosomes or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where the codons that make up its sequence are read by rRNA. tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize the codon on the mRNA and attach their corresponding amino acids, which bond to each other until a START codon is encountered in the P site, initiating protein synthesis. This process continues until a STOP codon is read from the mRNA in the A site, terminating the chain.	83e70166119bb2fcc8a34f64096e07f6	-1	3

It's an intricate process that ultimately results in life-giving proteins.	c836ca05abfa8b9ebd2e2aa182fdd072	-1	2
5	The process of protein synthesis is akin to a puzzle with multiple pieces - first, mRNA moves out of the nucleus to its destination; second, certain codons match with complementary tRNA molecules; third, amino acids from tRNAs link up to form peptide bonds; fourth, this continues until a STOP codon is encountered.	4bf7e45a0014b5ace52f291f608d1acc	-1	2
5	Matching the right pieces is essential to building any puzzle - similarly, Protein Synthesis is a meticulous process that begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. Subsequently, codons on rRNA are read and bound with tRNA anticodons; Amino acids from the tRNAs are then bonded together in a peptide chain; Finally, this chain grows until a STOP codon marks its end.	251fbdbeb20a55a9af7207aa2a8edbc4	-1	2
5	Firstly, the mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore like a train leaving a station! Second, it travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum like a hiker going on an adventure! Third, the mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA like a book readers exploring words! Lastly, tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognize and bond to the corresponding codons of the mRNA like puzzle pieces coming together!	4dbc4aab00601db5889b842df7056866	-1	1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus via the nuclear pore. This is followed by its movement through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. After that, triplets of mRNA bases are read in codons by rRNA. Lastly, tRNA brings complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons to recognize and bond to the mRNA's codon!	43324c74e23bb5aa25fd3d3b70c0c50e	-1	3
5	The mRNA escapes the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it is captured by a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The codons of the mRNA are read in triplets by rRNA, and at the same time, complementary tRNA anticodons recognize the codon. Amino acids then attach to the tRNA and link together to create a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site and finally ending with a STOP codon in the A site.	ff8ef7c863a4d1905c5779cdc6b815b5	-1	3
5	The mRNA begins its journey away from the nucleus by travelling through the cytoplasm. Once it reaches its destination, either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, it is ready to begin its duties. The codons on the mRNA are read in triplets by rRNA, while tRNA anticodons inversely recognize them. When this happens, amino acids attach to the tRNA, initiating the process of linking them together into a protein — first with a START codon in the P site before being completed with a STOP codon in the A site.	6ce2f12fae469e5686e3667a6211019d	-1	3
5	Escaping from the nucleus is only the start of mRNA's journey. On arrival at either a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, it must be read in triplets by rRNA and paired with its complementary tRNA anticodon. This triggers an attachment of amino acids to its partner tRNA and further chemically links them together until an eventual termination at a STOP codon.	473d0cb1fdc3c7868b3f9cb4e5b667b8	-1	3
5	As mRNA leaves its nuclear confines and navigates through the cytoplasm to its resting place at either a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, it can then have its codons interpreted by rRNA. This enables it to couple up with its complementary tRNA anticodon for which an assemblage of amino acids will attach, thus beginning protein synthesis with a START codon at the P site before concluding with a STOP codon at the A site.	4b25d3f5dbbc3f0f1a154ff9d61f7a3c	-1	3
5	mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then travels to either the ribosome or endoplasmic reticulum where its base pairs are read in codons of three nucleotides by rRNA. To facilitate bonding, tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon identifies the codon and links the corresponding amino acid. The protein is initiated with a START codon on the P site and built up as more amino acids are added with each tRNA until the STOP codon on the A site is read, concluding translation of the protein.	465707966fb1da428f4020b33084037a	-1	3
5	The process of protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore. This mRNA is read in codons of three nucleotides by rRNA at either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. To assemble the protein, tRNA brings complementary anticodons that recognize the codons and attach their respective amino acids. As more amino acids are added from each tRNA, they are linked together to make the protein, beginning with a START codon in the P site and ending with a STOP codon in the A site.	df3ee13787677735f61f10ba1fa5c3a8	-1	3
5	Protein translation begins as mRNA departs from the nucleus through nuclear pores. Upon entering the cytoplasm, it is fed into either ribosomes or the endoplasmic reticulum for codon recognition. rRNA reads mRNA in triplets called codons which tRNA matches with their complementary anticodons to link corresponding amino acids for assembly. Protein construction continues from each successive addition of amino acids triggered by a START codon at the P site and ends with a STOP codon at the A site.	39c5a17f09ceb26a5c1e99ebd10985fb	-1	3
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores, four steps must follow for protein synthesis to be completed: mRNA is read in triplets (codons) by rRNA; tRNA carrying its complementary anticodon recognizes said codon; this adds a new corresponding amino acid; these amino acids are linked together starting with START codon on P site and ending with STOP codon on A site.	0348e329e48da328fe1381ddd9ff4f66	-1	2
5	First, mRNA departs the nucleus via nuclear pore to reach the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, mRNA codons are read in triplets by rRNA, which allows tRNA with complementary anticodons to recognize and bind the codon. Thirdly, amino acids on the tRNA attach and link together to start a protein from the P site. Finally, amino acids grow until a STOP codon in the A site halts protein synthesis.	1bb736022b96c3d108bfc506fcb20a94	-1	2
5	Starting off with mRNA's exit from the nucleus through nuclear pores, the next step is reading the codons of mRNA in triplets by rRNA and recognizing complementary anticodons by tRNA. Then, amino acids are added to the tRNA and linked together beginning at the P site. Lastly, those amino acids continue to be linked and form a protein up until a STOP codon is read in the A site.	4ad0cb807a3ba3cd1db54ae31d9f3c40	-1	2
5	The journey begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through nuclear pores and heading towards ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following that, codons of mRNA is decoded in triplets by rRNA while tRNA recognizes the complementary anticodon and binds it.

Eventually, those amino acids are linked until a STOP codon is reached in A site.	5ee1cb4816b09fcf983ddccde1566d89	-1	2
5	As an initial step, mRNA passes through nuclear pore out of nucleus into cytoplasm before reaching either ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. During this time, rRNA reads codons in mRNA which tRNA translates as complementary anticodon. After that, building blocks (amino acids) of tRNA are joined in order on P site to start forming a protein. The chain continues to grow until STOP codon is encountered at A site.	ac1053212fb3393832efb545c3868632	-1	2
5	To begin protein synthesis, mRNA has to depart from nucleus through nuclear pores for it to reach either ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, rRNA reads codons of mRNA followed by tRNA binding complementary anticodon. Afterward, linked amino acids create proteins initiating with START codon at P site up until a STOP codon is found at A site.	d51833e24016a3a1b641bc1a0ae9ba41	-1	2
5	First off, mRNA takes its leave from nucleus by passing through nuclear pore prior to going to ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes along rRNA which reads triplets of codons that tRNA uses to identify complementary anticodons. Next off, linked amino acids pile up beginning with START codon at P site stretching until a STOP codon is found at A site.	e254990a21e99b7520274efe27e13b57	-1	2
5	At first glance, mRNA ought to abandon nucleus via nuclear pores for it to access either ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA's voyage from nucleus through nuclear pore into cytoplasm where it reaches either ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Onwards, rRNA interprets triplets of codons for tRNA's complementary anticodon recognition. Following that, attached amino acids cumulate beginning with START codon located at P site until arriving at a STOP codon situated in A site.	a8c658581ba1e0cc028a7faeaa42c8ee	-1	2
5	To start off protein synthesis process, mRNA needs to exit nucleus using nuclear pore en route to ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then comes along rRNA decoding triplets of mRNA which allows for tRNA's detection of its respective complementary anticodon. Thereafter, bolted-on amino acids line up commencing from START codon at P site till they reach STOP codon in the A site.	71b3edf6c6b35da063bc7e8cea4cb1ad	-1	2
5	Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, one of the four major steps in protein synthesis is when it passes through the nuclear pores and out into the cytoplasm.	bf661f6d9e4a818d38043c06855eca00	-1	1
5	The next step is when the mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome, where its sequence of bases (codons) are read by an adapter molecule known as rRNA.	bf2e496d9b22d41d9f07185ac103e6e1	-1	1
5	The tRNA then carries the complementary anticodon to recognise and bind to the codon on the mRNA, bringing with it the specific amino acid that corresponds to that codon.	23eac957d8c02557f7aa6d9f187be402	-1	1
5	This process of binding complementary codons and amino acids continues until a STOP codon is reached, at which point a chain of amino acids has been formed - a protein - which is released from the ribosome.	d65dcd1ebf1bd1590a1f89598125c3b8	-1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores, traveling to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Codons on the mRNA are read in triplet form by rRNA which is used to recognize the complementary anticodon on tRNA.

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At this point, the bases on the mRNA are read in triplets, referred to as codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This causes transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon to recognize the complementary codon of the mRNA. Subsequently, amino acids on the other end of tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a protein chain which starts with a START codon in the P site (initiation). The chain is subsequently extended until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination).	882b12934f2dd5e621c3f88c852fb8c6	-1	3
5	The mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore and is carried into the cytoplasm. There it finds its way to either a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Its message is then read through triplets of codons by rRNA, permitting transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying their complementary base pairs to recognize them. Consequently, amino acids present on the opposite ends of these tRNAs are bonded together, forming a protein chain that initiates with a START codon in the P site and finishes once a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.	e64a1eb666ca24362d219dd9c8fdef52	-1	3
5	Once mRNA has left the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it moves through cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum to have its triplets of codons decoded by rRNA.

5	Protein synthesis is a complex process which starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a special tunnel, called nuclear pore, and travelling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome. Then, the mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons which are matched to their complementary anticodons held by tRNA molecules. Subsequently, amino acids are linked together to form a protein molecule starting with a START codon in the P-site and ending with a STOP codon at the A-site.	ee211c0b370a6c613d0e419b63437f42	-1	3
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting nucleus via nuclear pores. In the cytoplasm, mRNA's codons are read in triplets and matched to their complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules. After that, amino acids are joined together to form proteins, commencing with a START codon on the P-site and concluding with a STOP codon at the A-site.	cf4c9e99df0476c3831dd41cfb8c744f	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis starts its path with mRNA leaving the nucleus via the nuclear pore, then it moves across the cytoplasm where its codons are read in triplets and matched up with their tRNA anticodons. Following that, amino acids are linked together while forming a protein molecule beginning with START codon at P-site and finishing off with STOP codon at A-site.	218cdfe1475fbcf01fe372b044c9acca	-1	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing from the nucleus through an elaborate gateway known as nuclear pore. Then, mRNA's codons are read in triplets and paired with their complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules. Subsequently, amino acids are strung together into proteins starting with a START codon at P-site followed by a STOP codon at A-site.	3d003cf3dc4c9a4a9ea0a2a7396cfd1b	-1	3
5	The production of proteins begins when mRNA escapes from nucleus through the nuclear pore. Then, mRNA's codons are read in triplets which get matched to their corresponding tRNA anticodons. After that, amino acids are connected together while constructing a protein molecule starting with START codon at P-site and concluding with STOP codon at A-site.	a1349af00cb4724372b71be202be373f	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis is an intricate process initiated by mRNA leaving its home base: nucleus, through a portal known as nuclear pore. Next, mRNA's codons are read in triples and coupled up with their anti-codons on tRNA molecules. Subsequently, amino acids join forces to form proteins beginning with START codon at P-site ending in STOP codon at A-site.	24834778659dfe4ce04f630ebc01091b	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis starts out when mRNA vacates from nucleus by way of nuclear pore. Then, mRNA's codons are read in triples matching up with their antithetical anticodons on tRNA molecules.

5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore so it can go on its wild adventure! It then travels to the ribosome or else enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, codons are read by rRNA in order to begin assembling the protein, before tRNA anticodons recognize complementary codons on the mRNA. Following that, amino acids become linked together by attaching each new amino acid to the tRNA. This process slowly builds up, until a STOP codon is reached and the protein is complete! Wow!	6882f4b269bd61d818ed38bac2b58ad3	-1	2
5	It all starts with mRNA escaping from the nucleus on an escape ship! The next step is to get to the ribosome quickly so that codons can be read and matched up with their antisense codons. Then, tRNA carries the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon which recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. This is followed by a magical process where the corresponding amino acids on the tRNA form bonds with new corresponding amino acids until a START codon is found. Finally, a STOP codon causes the completion of the protein - how amazing!	088a8e71d0cf0402f1f8aa540587bc5b	-1	2

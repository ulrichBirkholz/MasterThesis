5	The steps in protein synthesis include: 1) Transcription of DNA into mRNA within the nucleus; 2) Exit of mRNA from nucleus; 3) Translation of mRNA at ribosomes; 4) Assembly of amino acid sequences into proteins.	19185d72f1754a91e936ceb1604ded29	-1	3
5	To begin generating proteins, mRNA moves out of the nucleus and attaches itself onto a ribosome. The ribosomes then read this mRNA coding information and translate it into matching amino acids which link up in order to make up the desired proteins.	0940a897c382b2a96fb40849f01f3703	-1	1
5	The process of making proteins commences when mRNA departs from nucleus after it was transcribed from DNA inside. It is followed by four main steps: initiation ,elongation ,termination and post translation modifications.	d86af298f5e658060254393eecb038d9	-1	2
5	In the second step of protein synthesis, the polypeptide is folded into its three-dimensional structure. This is accomplished by various enzymes that help align and shape the polypeptide.	f9351da0273cc7d1d397b4e4ad3fd8e3	-1	2
5	MRNA first transcribed in the nucleus leaves to be translated into proteins through initiation, elongation, and termination processes. Initiation is when the mRNA binds to the ribosome, which then reads and translates it into an amino acid triplet sequence. In elongation, each amino acid is added to the chain until a stop codon is reached. Finally, termination signals for the release of the new formed protein.	ce38d21a1625744529dc2bd21c9718bb	-1	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it binds to a ribosome and is translated into a polypeptide chain. This polypeptide chain is then modified by enzymes to form an active protein.	47456c6f2393960e10ec9345aa8abbcf	-1	2
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA is subjected to a process called transcription, where RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence and creates a strand of mRNA. The mRNA then undergoes splicing, in which non-coding sequences are removed before it is transported to the ribosome. Here, it is translated into amino acid sequences during translation, forming a polypeptide chain. Finally, the polypeptide folds into its 3D structure and performs its function in posttranslational modification.	e51e40a968723ef9d8263c12a1666728	-1	0
5	To do this, tRNA molecules carrying matching amino acids are brought into contact with the ribosome in response to each successive codon read on the mRNA strand.	62c9e25626fc810056e56f606b868279	-1	3

5	Transcription of mRNA in the nucleus signals for protein synthesis to begin. Afterwards, mRNA travels through the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome, allowing for translation of codons within its sequence into amino acids. As tRNA’s bring amino acids to join the polypeptide chain, it continues to grow in length. After completion of this chain, the new protein is released and can subsequently undergo post-translational modifications.	bf3062078d58f55838454731741ec637	-1	3
5	Ribosomal Binding: The mRNA will then bind to the small ribosomal subunit that is made up of rRNA and protein. This allows the ribosome to start translating codons on mRNA into amino acids.	7b7eee5a66df12dc8e66e09d10dcffea	-1	1

5	Ribosomes are sites of protein synthesis, where the genetic code from mRNA is converted into proteins through the assembly of amino acids. Following this, mRNA exits the nucleus via nuclear pores and enters the cytoplasm. This triggers a process known as translation, which involves codons on mRNA being read in triplets by Ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) then carries complementary anticodons to pairs with each codon, thus delivering its corresponding amino acid.

5	As mRNA departs from the nucleus, protein synthesis is initiated with four distinct stages: recognizing codons, binding an anticodon, adding amino acids and extending the polypeptide chain. This process allows for proteins to be created from gene sequences.	14d25f2d3ebfa1b9b6b6120ef1c6944e	-1	1
5	To initiate protein synthesis mRNA departs from nucleus to reach cytoplasm containing three-base coded sequences called codons. These codons are associated with tRNAs taking reverse anti-codons that link respective amino acids collectively building proteins commencing at P stage with START codon concluding at A point using STOP code.	d340b703bd70b7322a9ac8ca5c4d1be2	-1	2
5	tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA, Amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site and Amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site	fbc958e6c1d309bd0035d2e7db6aad51	-1	2
5	Starting with mRNA leaving its habitat-the nucleus-through nuclear pores, protein production requires four major steps: First, it moves through cytoplasm into ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum where codons on the mRNA molecule are read by rRNA; Second, tRNA provides complimentary anticodons reciprocating with codons on mRNA; Third, adjacent tRNAs’ amino acids connect according to genetic instructions; Last but not least, new amino acids produce a protein chain linked together until its final termination at STOP codon.	d5b0e1aedea5d8ec993608094d9f57b1	-1	3
5	To begin with, mRNA moves out of nucleus using nuclear pores before travelling further into cytoplasm until it reaches ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum where it gets read in triplets named 'codons' by matching rRNAs. After that tRNAs arrive with respective (U=A, C+G) anticodons that recognize this particular codon present on mRNA and bond related amino acids located at their ends. Lastly these amino acids join up starting from START codon situated at P site and ultimately terminating with STOP codon found at A site forming fully formed proteins.	cc7fb7824beb46bfa7197ba977b6ec98	-1	3

5	The process of protein synthesis starts when mRNA molecules leave the nucleus and travel to either ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum found in cytoplasm. These mRNA molecules carry coding information as triplets called codons. Then these codons interact with transfer RNAs (tRNAs). These tRNAs carry anticodons which pair up with complimentary sequences on mRNA. This helps them attach appropriate amino acids to form a polypeptide chain starting from START codon and ending at STOP codon.	cf7a50046410387aff55488de9a3f60d	-1	3
5	It's almost a magical process! The nucleus seems aware of just when mRNA needs to leave, so it dispatches it through a nuclear pore into the cytoplasm or RER.

Moving further into cytoplasm it gets attached with ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum where rRNA reads out mRNA bases as triplets named as codons. With this help of complementary (U=A, C+G)anticodons of tRNA amino acids bind together till forming of START Codon at P site and STOP Codon at A site occurs thus completing protein synthesis.	3b465cf22e068a8c3160abc9f8ab4482	-1	3

5	The first step in protein synthesis is for mRNA leaving nucleus through nuclear pore. Triplet code of DNA sequences recognized by rRNA is then translated into codons.

5	The mRNA is the bridge that takes the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosomes (or even to the endoplasmic reticulum). Its bases are read in triplets known as codons, and each codon is matched with its complementary anticodon on a tRNA molecule that brings the appropriate amino acid. This process of matching and bonding the amino acids continues until a START codon is reached, marking the beginning of protein synthesis. The sequence of amino acids that make up the protein is then assembled until a STOP codon is encountered (elongation and termination).	fde70fe35dcb8e7da41a04bcfa1cd6a7	-1	2

5	Beginning with mRNA traversing out of the nucleus via nuclear pores, four stages are involved in protein synthesis; including reading of its codons by anticodons on tRNA molecules to link up appropriate amino acids, initiation with START codon at P site and termination by stop codon recognition at A site.	e91c7983573eadb95ec9db692821e83e	-1	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via the nuclear pore and travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the ribosomes, mRNA is transcribed into codons that act as instructions for assembling amino acids into proteins. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) carrying anticodons recognize these codons and bring complementary amino acids together to bond into long, polypeptide chains. These chains will continue to grow until a STOP codon is encountered signalling the completion of protein synthesis.	ce1fb2a0669e04fc62eeb94d99424677	-1	3
5	The translation phase begins from point where transcribed RNA leaves nucleus through nuclear pore and makes its way either toward ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum; here bases are split into triplets termed as 'codons' accomplished under guidance of rRNAs supported by tRNAs carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon which connects to same type of triples found on mRNA leading to chain reaction of sequenced amino acids commencing from START code within P site culminating upon arriving at STOP code within A site.	0c56ba76936cd3f46bcc316d9d45d7a0	-1	3

5	mRNA exits the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is read in doublets by tRNA, which binds with complementary codons on the mRNA. The corresponding amino acids on the tRNA are combined to form a protein, starting from a START codon in the P site (initiation) and ending with a STOP codon in the A site (elongation and termination).	2306eedda4049b93de49e82cd52ec984	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis is an intense game of molecular hide-and-seek! First, mRNA has to find its way out of the nucleus using nuclear pore portals. Then, it's off to the ribosome where codons on the mRNA are read out in triplets by rRNA as if they were reciting poetry. Afterwards, tRNA come along with their complementary anticodons to bond amino acids in sequence until a STOP codon appears - and voilà! A brand new protein is born!	2980ff51f99ea5b715885aa057b19c3a	-1	3
5	It starts with mRNA being sent from nucleus via nuclear pores and reaching either ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum. Thereafter, rRNA interpret triplets of nucleotides known as codons while tRNAs bring corresponding anti-codons connecting themselves to it. In conclusion, these linked together amino acids construct a protein upon encountering a STOP codon.	163e731683a7b1cfaa7c7b853b342517	-1	2
5	Starting with mRNA embarking from nucleus, protein synthesis transpires through four major steps: tRNA recognition of codons attached to complementary amino acids; peptide bond formation between START and STOP codons; elongation of polypeptide chain; termination when stop codon is read in A-site.	09d9987e6baaa5d41c1f88d249deca20	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and progress towards ribosomes for translation into an array of amino acids followed by binding of tRNA molecules with complementary codons on respective mRNA strands. Finally, these peptide links unite to produce proteins from START to STOP codon in-between.	b56fb646478cbcc1537b9842fb9ef5c2	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis is an assembly line: mRNA exits nucleus, codons in the mRNA are read by rRNA and matched to complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules, and amino acids are consecutively added to form proteins until a STOP codon is encountered.	c2a7572ee5250d71b018d50f64945ef8	-1	3

5	In protein synthesis, mRNA is decoded into proteins through a start codon located in the P site and elongated until a stop codon is received at the A site. This process requires complementary tRNA molecules that recognize codons on the mRNA strand and replace them with their corresponding amino acids.	5d4694284093bd8c6412ef0963d07cfc	-1	2
5	Escape from nucleus happening through nuclear pores allows mRNA passage to either ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Hereupon, rRNA examines its bases as tripartite codons while tRNA binds its complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons and links corresponding amino acids together.

5	The mRNA is released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it undergoes a process of being read in triplets known as codons using rRNA. The complementary tRNA molecule carrying the anticodon recognizes the complementary codon and attaches its corresponding amino acid to the previous one, in a sequence that continues until a STOP codon is encountered.	f041e539c1c0b3cdd370c5e2a9675499	-1	2
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus - triggering rRNA to read triplet codons on said mRNA that help tRNA recognize complementary codons. Amino acids are then added to form chains until a STOP codon is encountered indicating completion.	202193924f02b7f54da0592843ce2496	-1	3

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves codons on this molecule being read by rRNA in triplets. This triggers a tRNA carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon to recognize it, adding a new corresponding amino acid to it. The chain of amino acids continues to be linked, starting from a START codon at the P site until a STOP codon is encountered at A site, forming the protein.	92c52bcb738a676e579b58812e5c7530	-1	3
5	Beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four main steps involved in protein synthesis are: 1) mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore; 2) tRNA recognizing and binding to complementary codons present on mRNA; 3) amino acids being added to the growing polypeptide chain due to tRNA anticodon-mRNA codon recognition; and 4) the completed protein resulting from the recognition of a STOP codon. This process can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle, where various pieces must fit together to form an image.	5dba016a51cf9a53ee84b650806b8b3d	-1	3
5	From nuclear pores spouts out mRNA, ready to comprehend its own code-breaking mission. Within this mission lie codons in threes - each releasing specific information that binds with tRNA, its complementary anticodon and associated amino acid - all of which is managed by START and STOP codons.	cc4c3fa42449ff156731dc286c2e463c	-1	2
5	As soon as mRNA leaves the nucleus it binds with ribosomes which split them into their nucleotides. These nucleotides act as triggers for nearby tRNAs that have complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons of their own that help link together specific amino acids until a STOP codon is encountered.	070f40a35298539e982814aced8a3919	-1	2
5	Similar to a manufacturing line, tRNA acts as a conveyor belt carrying amino acids to the appropriate sites, where they are connected step-by-step to form a protein. The mRNA acts as an instruction manual sending codons that act as commands for the tRNA.	1c9b4b8572bbc73fa61cdbcabbb52954	-1	1
5	To start off protein synthesis, mRNA has to leave the nucleus first. Afterwards, codons on it read in triplets by rRNA followed by corresponding anti-codon of tRNA binding onto them.

5	Upon exiting the nucleus, mRNA takes a different path depending on its destination: either the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In either case, mRNA is read in triplets known as 'codons' by specialized transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The codons act as a template for protein synthesis, creating proteins one amino acid at a time until a stop codon is reached.	e4a7363cd3865ac7f494f4f7820ec334	-1	3
5	mRNA escapes from nucleus then goes through cytoplasm before arriving at ribosome or entering rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	First, mRNA exits the nucleus through the nuclear pore and moves to a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, akin to a postman delivering a package. The mRNA nucleotide bases are then read in clusters of three called codons by ribosomal RNA, like a salesperson decoding a customer's order. Next, transfer RNA (tRNA) with complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on mRNA, like a barcode scanner matching price tags. Finally, amino acids from the tRNA are bonded together to form a protein, like a chef assembling ingredients into a meal.	ffd738384d4db1f7cfd29cd5f26b53cd	-1	3
5	To begin protein synthesis, mRNA needs to leave the nucleus first – through a nuclear pore – before finding itself at either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. rRNA reads its codons in triplets, while tRNA recognizes these and attaches appropriate amino acids that eventually get linked together until forming a protein from a START and STOP codon.	7c3e0c0dbe1984db00b5087b7ecc45f2	-1	2

5	At the core of protein synthesis lies mRNA leaving its home in the nucleus and traveling out to either ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	First, mRNA leaving the nucleus is translated by ribosomes into codons that are read in triplets and recognized by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons. In this way, amino acids can be linked together to make a protein. Secondly, the newly formed protein is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is broken down further for additional processing.	0700fb549843a8d41898ca7b0a1cb885	-1	1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it finds its way to a ribosome which reads out triplet units called codons which line up with complementary anti-codons carried by tRNAs (transfer RNAs) containing their appropriate associated amino acid. Once these are linked together they form one long chain that becomes our desired protein until it is done building at its designated STOP codon.	974b8c6cafc5ac024bb51a4fc0683db0	-1	2

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, four major steps involve travelling through the cytoplasm, binding with ribosomes and tRNA molecules, and finally connecting amino acids together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA.	9506e5ea67bec99f5e0c7f993073f1d7	-1	3
5	Once mRNA has left the nucleus, it binds with ribosomes which read its instructions and assemble a protein from amino acids according to the genetic code. Once complete, these proteins travel back into the nucleus for further processing.	531b0b934d101542ff458438b383db25	-1	1
5	Starting with mRNA's departure from nucleus, protein synthesis involves several crucial steps; tRNA reads triplet coded nucleotides on mRNA using complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons and calls for required amino acids that join together until a STOP codon indicates termination.	68e3b35299ddfbf58613e731dbe35798	-1	3
5	Leaving the nucleus is just one step in the grand symphony for protein synthesis. mRNA's codons must be matched to tRNAs carrying complementary anticodons, while the corresponding amino acids must be added and then linked together until a STOP codon is reached, concluding the production of a single protein molecule.	62f68cab478284f7458c8cb3d7afdb86	-1	2
5	After mRNA has left the nucleus, it connects with a ribosome which reads off triplets of nucleotides called codons.

5	5. Before a protein can be synthesized, mRNA must first exit its nucleus via nuclear pore. Upon its arrival at either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, an rRNA molecule will read codons in triplets and match them with complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules. The amino acid linked to these tRNAs will then bond together until all of them have been added, creating a protein.	fb393e30920160f11679054e00f55aa5	-1	2
5	mRNA binds to ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum after leaving the nucleus. Bases in triplets, called codons, are decoded by rRNA and if they find a complementary tRNA anticodon, they bind and the amino acid attached to it is transferred to make a polypeptide chain. The process continues until a STOP codon is reached.	cd7c57d9e457f67de5d6342521da7f85	-1	2
5	mRNA exits the nucleus via nuclear pore, enters the cytoplasm, and is received by the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. mRNA codons are read in triplets by rRNA, and tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes this and brings in the corresponding amino acids. These are then added to adjacent tRNAs so they can be linked together to form a protein.	742681280bdde73b773d06c22da31afd	-1	3

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore and is directed to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is read in triplets known as codons by other types of RNA, such as Ribosomal RNA (rRNA). tRNA then recognizes the complementary codon of mRNA and adds the corresponding amino acids linked together, forming a protein that starts with a START codon and ends with a STOP codon.	cba7eef2d1e781ba6073b75b14c61ca0	-1	2

5	One key element in protein synthesis is the separation of wheat from chaff: mRNA nucleotides are 'read' by tRNA anticodons in triplets until the STOP codon is reached.	bbb43e6504411870465ec2f337738819	-1	3
5	mRNA exits the nucleus through nuclear pores and travels to the ribosome where codons are read in triplets by rRNA. This process is comparable to a sommelier identifying a good vintage as they read the cork's label.	186a00e2ab60300724b68b07093af87b	-1	1
5	Once the codons are read, the complementary tRNA anticodons pair with the codons and link them to the corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded together in the ribosome’s A site.	c5a18dd9f6424bd42e28bae46cbd5e16	-1	2
5	Fifthly, upon exiting the nucleus mRNA molecules travel to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. RNA is read in triplets (codons) which initiate recognition by tRNA anticodons that bind matching amino acids. The formation of a protein is completed with START and STOP codons.	4047d5f450af2b0360244cba25af0888	-1	1
5	The process starts with mRNA leaving nucleus via nuclear pores and travelling to the ribosome or endoplasmic reticulum. At this point, tRNA bonds to the complementary codons on the mRNA forming a chain of amino acids. This is followed by addition of more amino acids to those already bonded, building a complete protein until a STOP codon is reached by the ribosome.	07ccf44dd603c8a22cbb9609c7962e6d	-1	2
5	Proteins are formed when mRNA journeys from within the nucleus to carry codons which provide instructions for their assembly. Upon recognition of these base triplets by rRNA, they match to complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules allowing for successive bonding of amino acids starting from a START codon in the P site until reaching a STOP codon in the A site.	531133dcbbdda4ee25eb96d8af5bc1e6	-1	2
5	As soon as mRNA departs from its nuclear origin it sets out on a mission to meet up with the tRNA, who carries complementary anticodons that when paired will start forming proteins via linkage of adjacent amino acids.	f2d62e1c34bd1260fe13be2f69b8abff	-1	3

5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys through cytoplasm towards ribosomes or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The codons on mRNA are deciphered by rRNA, allowing tRNA with matching anticodons to identify them. The linked amino acids from these tRNA's build a chain beginning with a START codon in P site & terminating at STOP codon in A site.	5bf0997e3458dd98f12f0e30372e7b1e	-1	3
5	When building proteins from scratch, one must begin with mRNA leaving the nucleus. This journey through cytoplasm leads to ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum where codons are read by rRNA and matched with complimentary anticodons on tRNA which carry corresponding amino acids. These then link together to make a functional protein!	20a8b3d93ce34a32436e16d0531143a9	-1	3
5	As mRNA leaves the nucleus it carries genetic information that must be translated into proteins; this occurs at the ribosome as triplet codons are read by rRNA and paired with complimentary tRNA molecules whose corresponding amino acids create peptide bonds to build proteins.	1458338e8fd8a9402400362af30639f6	-1	2
5	The protein production process requires mRNA molecules to exit the nucleus and travel throughout the cytoplasm to ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum where it will begin its journey down the path of translation. Along this path, codons will be recognized by tRNA molecules while peptide bonds between amino acids are formed until finally concluding upon reaching a STOP codon.	f634829ddd56e141fefeeff9eef43254	-1	3
5	Molecules of mRNA must exit the nucleus through nuclear pore as one of four major steps in protein synthesis. This is followed by rRNA translating codons from mRNA, which tRNA recognizes through its complementary anticodon. Lastly, amino acids are bound together via peptide bonds until STOP codon is found.	abf88b84ec456f99708bc2d02d8af89d	-1	3
5	First, mRNA is formed within the nucleus which then travels through a nuclear pore. This mRNA contains instructions for building proteins in the form of codons that are read by tRNAs carrying complementary anticodons. These tRNAs join together amino acids which are then linked by ribosomes until either a STOP or START codon is read.	4bd090c34ad8e17fc086085f5b43e7b5	-1	3
5	The production of proteins starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. The mRNA binds to ribosomes and is interpreted in triplets of nucleotides called codons. This triggers tRNA molecules to enter the ribosome which hold the corresponding amino acids. Once attached, each new amino acid binds to its neighbour and forms a peptide bond until the termination codon is reached which marks the end of protein synthesis.	f5114aaab992289c86cb72ec263d7e71	-1	2
5	Protein synthesis begins with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is read by ribosomal RNA in codons of triplets to bind with complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules.

5	mRNA read by ribosome to make proteins	b4b2bb37d33047448e3d660617f9a326	-1	1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome, where it is read in codons: three nucleotides which code for a single amino acid. After being 'read' by ribosomal RNA, tRNA molecules with complementary anticodons are brought in, carrying their complementary amino acids. Then, these two molecules form covalent bonds, linking together the amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Finally, when a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, the protein is completed.	2de609f7dc758b0105bb31fc1e0def14	-1	3
5	At the ribosome, the mRNA codons are translated into an amino acid chain, adding one new amino acid at a time according to the instructions carried by the mRNA. This process commences with the START codon and ends with the STOP codon, thus forming a polypeptide chain that folds into the desired protein.	17c33a69fc6d9385463019ddae6a7dab	-1	3
5	The first step of protein synthesis begins inside nucleus with transcription completing and mRNA leaving via nuclear pore. It then travels through cytoplasm towards ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum where it gets translated into proteins using unique tRNA triplets (U=A, C+G) that can recognize complementary sequences on mRNA. Thus, individual amino acids get added together to construct a protein from START till STOP codon.	8101e405517ff8c271b1de0a67dd50b6	-1	3

5	The process of protein synthesis is initiated once the mRNA has left the nucleus, beginning with tRNA recognition of its complementary codons. As a result, amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain which will eventually become a protein strand. The protein strand is created through adding successive amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA.	6cc3ff8af662b77e38e136dbda415c3e	-1	2

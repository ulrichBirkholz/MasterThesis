With this step, the cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey process begins which is as strong as a lion and mince in its precision.	b4d0f9b45bc3a26fc83debf9d8936a9c	0	0
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read in codons of three bases by ribosomal RNA. The corresponding amino acids are then brought in on transfer RNA and attached to the growing polypeptide chain. After the polypeptide chain is formed, it folds into its final shape faster than a jackrabbit on a date.	fb159440453fcfabb4701768ed3550b4	0	1

5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it binds with ribosomes to form a complex. Next, the tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome complex, which are then joined together in a specific order dictated by the mRNA to create a polypeptide chain. After this, the polypeptide chain folds into its unique shape and finally undergoes post-translational modifications before being released into the cytoplasm.	f3bb688e4217ac173a8da4b74f496725	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome, which acts as the 'workbench' for protein synthesis. On this ribosome, the mRNA is translated into a polypeptide chain, one amino acid at a time. Every three bases of mRNA (codon) is translated into one amino acid by tRNA which carries the appropriate amino acid. This process is referred to as translation and it takes place in two stages: initiation and elongation. During initiation, a start codon signals for the first tRNA to bind to the mRNA and start the formation of a polypeptide chain. During elongation, each successive codon is bound by a new tRNA with its corresponding amino acid.	1d28940ceb2c89d6cd930c99414a0cfd	3	3

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA on the A site and continues to link amino acids until a STOP codon is read. Protein synthesis begins with a START codon in the P site which links amino acids together to form a protein.	b098e5e16a1eaeeddda1a4ae6acaec69	3	2
5	Four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: initiation, where a START codon is read in the P site; elongation and termination, when tRNA carries the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA and amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is read in A site; binding, when the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids; and mRNA travelling, when mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	014352fc21eeeeefd6adba3b9b31c98a	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and binds to a ribosome. This triggers the formation of a START codon in the P site, which is then matched with an incoming tRNA carrying the first amino acid.  Subsequent tRNAs carrying new amino acids join the chain until a STOP codon is read, ending the process of elongation and termination.	94f0cfac49de457c56d09ed8d1685aa7	3	3
5	mRNA exits the nucleus through the nuclear pore and then travels either to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum where each tRNA adds a new corresponding amino acid, allowing for the synthesis of protein.	121ca4265e896144e959fb48b7fa935e	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. Here, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in triplets called codons. As the ribosomes move along the mRNA strand, amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, resulting in the termination of the process.	a09f58be7394a0a2d769951035c44431	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. There, a tRNA molecule brings the corresponding amino acid for the mRNA codon in the P site, beginning protein synthesis with a START codon. Subsequently, adjacent tRNA molecules bond their amino acids together, and new amino acids are added to the tRNA molecules in order to continue forming the polypeptide chain.	026d5f389e41771b70a0d83e3d30d353	3	3
5	Protein synthesis is a complex process that involves the use of both mRNA and DNA to create new proteins; it is the result of specific interactions between the two molecules and their respective reactions with other molecules in the cell.	4a30bbb6fb7869009abac11607929249	3	3
5	mRNA exiting the nucleus is read in triplets called codons by rRNA, which are then translated into corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA. These amino acids are then bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.	fda1fa25df899f9f54f6be896a317c6c	3	3
5	Transcription of mRNA from the nucleus is the first step in protein synthesis. Ribosomes then attach to and move along the mRNA strand, decoding codons and using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to bind to complementary codons. The tRNA's bring the corresponding amino acids which are then joined together with peptide bonds, forming a polypeptide chain. Finally, this chain is released from the ribosome as a protein.	b857f6d46af592b5b29bfa0a805cc7dc	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is then 'read' by ribosomes, which translate the code into a sequence of amino acids. The tRNA molecule carries the amino acids to the ribosome, where they are bonded together like links in a chain. As the chain grows, it folds into a 3D shape dictated by its sequence. Finally, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are joined together like pieces of a puzzle, forming a complete protein.	90e1d53bad20d8ef4ebb3b58e8d68725	3	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, four major steps involved in protein synthesis are: tRNA carrying complementary anticodon recognizes codon on mRNA; corresponding amino acid is added to tRNA; amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with START codon in P site; bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA.	08a5256a24309ef1f41153565742d4b9	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where it binds to a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A new corresponding amino acid is then added to the tRNA, with this process repeated until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, indicating termination of the synthesis.	775642f2001b7eeb82fa7820d2d8339c	3	3
5	mRNA exits the nucleus and travels to either the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At the ribosome, tRNA brings the corresponding amino acids to form a chain that will make a protein, starting with a START codon that is bonded to the P site. The complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons on the tRNA recognize and pair with the codons on the mRNA to build up the chain of amino acids.	fd48b8e573e7177eb1d3d83637ab6810	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. This then allows a new corresponding amino acid to be added to the tRNA. The amino acids continue to be linked together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of the elongation and termination stage.	83cbb32706650d867e7351c743910417	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and continues with tRNA bringing a corresponding amino acid to the ribosome. The mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons, which is facilitated by rRNA. This is followed by the initiation of protein formation at the P site with a START codon. Finally, amino acids are linked together to form a protein.	0555d663267ebc71e9f4dc9c3ba0fdf0	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling either to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These codons are then read by ribosomal RNA in triplets, forming a chain of amino acids which continue until a STOP codon is read in the A site, thus ending both elongation and termination.	6ef78362618dc98062cc094356700247	3	3
5	mRNA travels out of the nucleus via nuclear pore and binds to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. Then, tRNA carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the mRNA codons and adds new corresponding amino acid. Finally, the added amino acids are linked together by rRNA until the stop codon is read, forming the protein.	8eaf18440ff8d054eda08eae010f4097	2	2

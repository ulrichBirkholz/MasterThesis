5	Beginning with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, there are four major steps in protein synthesis: attaching amino acids to the corresponding tRNA molecules, allowing the mRNA to be read through the A site and translated into the growing polypeptide chain, incorporating new amino acids via linking, and finally, terminating the process when a STOP codon is seen at the A site.	3dd734300d53fc3e240859981eb21fe0	3	3
5	mRNA departing the nucleus is subjected to a process of codon reading by ribosomal RNA, which then enables the mRNA to travel either through the cytoplasm to a ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum for amino acid linking. The process of elongation and termination continues until a STOP codon is read in the A site of the mRNA.	6f6b8d1055919cda7aafe9520f69bc1c	2	2
5	mRNA is released from the nucleus through the nuclear pore and travels to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it's read in triplets known as codons.

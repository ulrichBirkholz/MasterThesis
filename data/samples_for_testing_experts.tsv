6	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.	15119	3	2

Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.	15306	3	3

6	Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.      Type one is passive transport. This occurs when the cell dosen't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane.     Type two is active transport.

5	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal.

6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.	14905	3	3
6	DIFFFUSION, or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zone;FACILITATED DIFFUSION, or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membrane;ACTIVE TRANSPORT, meaning that the cell invests ATP in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps.	14911	3	3

5	First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.	11846	3	3

5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.	11872	3	3

6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.	14444	3	2

6	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.	15211	3	3

6	The genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus. When they are switched to MRNA also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance. The third process  is TRNA or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle. The whole process then repeats itself.	15250	0	0
6	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.	15251	3	3
6	cells use endocytosis, exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     In endocytosis, material is encased and becomes part of a cell. in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them out.in osmosis, water is difused and material travels through the membrane	15254	3	3

6	The three processes that help a cell control the substance movements over its membrane could be diffusion, the movement of any particles through the membrane, or equilibrium, which is the outer concentration being equal to the one inside, and the process in which the cell produces energy, which is transfered out of the cell.	15269	0	0

6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are when the cell membrane uses proteins to allow substances through the membrane, when small particles enter through the cell membrane, and when particles too large to enter the membrane through proteins use enzymes to make the particles smaller.	15317	0	0
6	Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.      Type one is passive transport.

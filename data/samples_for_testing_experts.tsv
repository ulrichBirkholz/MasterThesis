5	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.	12561	3	3
5	1. The mRNA makes new protein 2. It starts the process of making a new protein strand3. It finds which protein it needs for the strand4. A new protein is formed	12566	0	0
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to into the Endoplasmic Reticulum.  It travels through the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi Apparatus.  There, the Golgi Apparatus decides where the mRNA should go, and then sends it to the ribosomes.  When the mRNA arrives at the nucleus, it is made into a protein.	12567	1	1
5	it conects to the DNA and makes mRNA, the mRNA than takes messages to other parts of the cell, it goes through the nucleus, through the cell membrane, and than off to the other parts of the cell.	12574	0	0
5	The first step for mRNA leaving the nucleus is that it heads to a protein, it goes to a protein so it can attach itself. The second step is the mRNA puts in information from the nuclues, this helps so that the proteins can get messages to do things so that it can do what the nucleus needs it to do. Then the protein will start to create new proteins, so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks. The final step is the mRNA leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus, so that the mRNA can go to another cell. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, and then it can create more energy. This also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce, or use them for energy.	12576	0	0

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus with the DNA information because DNA can't leave the nucleus. Once the mRNA has taken the information to its destination, tRNA then takes place to bring the correct amino acids in respect to the letters from the mRNA. After this is done, proteins are made.	12702	0	0

The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a pole. In telophase the cell then slpits in half to form two cells.	12719	0	0
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is moved to an amino acid that corresponds with the codon. It then becomes tRNA and each amino acids pair together to make a polypeptide. The poly peptide begins to coil and twist together. As its coiling, it is making a choromosome to create DNA.	12741	1	1

6	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	14261	3	3

6	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.	14933	2	2

6	The cell can use the ion channel to get ions in and out. The cell can also use the sodium potassium pump to move sodium in and potassium out. Then the last thing they can use is an enzyme. The enzymes can cause the bigger ions that can not fit though the ion channel help them move across the cell membrain so they can come in and help the cell function properly.	15432	1	1

6	Osmosis is the movement of particles from two different sides of the membrane using hypertonic and hypotonic forces.Diffusion if the natural movement of substances across the cell membrane.Facilitated diffusion requires cell energy. This type of diffusion is used for particles that are two large to pass through the cell membrane. Their are protein channels made for specific substances to pass through opening and closing like a trap door.	15558	1	2
6	A process that moves substances across the cell membrane is osmosis, the diffusion of water.  Another is diffusion, having more water in one part of the cell membrane than the other part.	15571	1	1

6	The processes used by cells to control the movement of substance across the cell membrane by meiosis. They let the cell move or the cell would have a flagella.	15609	0	0
6	The cell can use endocystosis, which brings in nutrients and proteins from the outside by wrapping the cell membrane around it. They can also use exocystosis, which puts objects out nutrients and proteins by releasing them in a bubble. There is also the transport protein which allows small nutrients to pass through the membrane.	15612	0	3

6	The cell can suck food in, can spit it out, and can hold it in place with the membrane.	15656	0	0
6	One process is active transport, which is transport with the aid of transport proteins. Transport proteins help to get the substances to move through the plasma membrane. Another process is passive transport, which is not very differet from active transport, except this transport does not use the aid of transport proteins. The substances move without them.A third process is exocytosis or endocytosis.Exocytosis is the secreting or expelling of unwanted materials or wastes.Endocytosis is the surrounding and engulfing of materials.	15674	1	1

6	Cells can use the process of osmosis which has water pass through its barrier. A second process is diffusion. Lastly, a third process is facilitated diffusion.	15726	1	1
6	They use translation, transcription, and replication.	15736	0	0
6	The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.	15747	3	3

5	As mRNA leaves the nucleus, four major steps of protein synthesis occur: tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizes the complementary codon on the mRNA; a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA; amino acids are linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site; and finally, mRNA travels through the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	0f999eb985046fa61fdb00d66819ec39	2	3
5	After mRNA is synthesised and exits the nucleus, tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon on the mRNA. This enables a new amino acid to be added to the tRNA. The process of initiation then begins as amino acids are linked together to form a protein starting with a start codon in the P site. As the chain of amino acids grows, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodons reads the codons on the mRNA and its corresponding amino acids are linked to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids until a stop codon is read in the A site, completing the process of elongation and termination.	96b550420fefcd47410780f24ab54f91	3	2
5	mRNA leaving the nucleus is read by ribosomes in groups of 3 known as codons. tRNA recognizes and binds to complementary codons, bringing an amino acid to the site.

Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, there are four key steps involved: initiation, where the mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons; elongation, where a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA; termination, where amino acids continue to be linked together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site; and finally, mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	5beba74aa53074ae5909a298aa82a7e6	2	1
5	mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, is then transported to a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it is read in triplets called codons, enabling tRNA carrying complementary anticodons to recognize the mRNA's codons and link the requisite amino acids until a STOP codon is reached, signaling protein synthesis termination.	fde0a7a48f05f96d5fbce154afdec7ac	2	2
5	Protein synthesis occurs when mRNA leaves the nucleus via nuclear pore and is translated into amino acids by tRNA which bind to a complementary codon on the mRNA, starting with a START codon in the P site.

Then, as the mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons (by rRNA), amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site and the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, thus creating a protein.	b98edad244885abc3904a3506ce8a40e	3	3

Protein channels facilitate the movement of specific molecules in or out of the cell, while active transport uses energy to move a substance against the concentration gradient. Selective permeability is used to allow certain substances to move quickly and easily through the cell membrane, as swift as a Calgary wind.	aedf7d19f7b31bf63246c9354a4b942a	3	3
6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, facilitated diffusion, and selective permeability. Active transport uses energy to move a substance against its concentration gradient, facilitated diffusion utilizes membrane pathways to allow for particles to enter or leave the cell, and selective permeability is when the cell membrane only allows certain molecules to pass through it.	d71dd511ec9d17429bc4b2ffaa13bc57	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are selective permeability, protein channels, and active transport. Selective permeability allows certain substances to pass through while protein channels are specific molecules or substances that can enter or exit the cell, and active transport requires energy to move a substance across the cell membrane.	a45d25b7bab0efffb735e030114bb0ea	3	3
6	Three primary processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport requires energy to move a substance across the cell membrane against its concentration gradient, while passive transport occurs when a substance moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without requiring energy. Finally, facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.	c75829d06b7ea1ae1b76311d6c6c2505	3	2
6	Cells use three primary processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane: active transport, facilitated diffusion, and passive transport. Active transport requires energy to move molecules against a concentration gradient while facilitated diffusion uses special proteins to move molecules down their respective concentration gradients. Lastly, passive transport utilizes no energy and involves the movement of molecules from an area of high to low concentration.	0914a66a73442f4907d575eeadcacf55	3	3
6	Cell membranes control the movement of substances across it by using osmosis, facilitated diffusion, and selective permeability; however, pumps, protein channels, active and passive transport, endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and exocytosis can also be used.	3b8069cf591e2dae9746834b26ab0b9d	3	3
6	Active transport, osmosis, and passive transport are processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. These processes differ in that active transport requires energy to move a substance from an area of low to high concentration, while osmosis involves the diffusion of water across the cell membrane, and passive transport moves substances from an area of higher to lower concentration.	741248706a2c4e55aeb7c890f8e31392	3	3
6	Cell membranes make use of selective permeability, passive transport, active transport, facilitated diffusion, pumps, channel proteins, vesicles, phagocytosis, endocytosis and osmosis to control the movement of substances.	dc09c19b6ec63be77b0605583598054f	3	3

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read in triplets, called codons, by a specialized rRNA, where specific tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA. The corresponding amino acid is then added to the tRNA, allowing the corresponding amino acids from other adjacent tRNA’s to be bonded together.	63d312168f7be476d020b5f139b0bfa5	2	2
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four main steps: initiation, in which a START codon is read in the P site; elongation, where amino acids are added one at a time to the growing chain until a STOP codon is reached; termination, where the chain is released; and translation, where the tRNA molecules link up with the appropriate amino acids, forming a protein as solid as the Canadian Shield.	45d51e9e5f942df300e7e60d89ae1a30	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, amino acids are linked to each other at the P site of ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum in a process called initiation. Codons, which are triplets of mRNA bases, are then read by rRNA and the corresponding amino acids are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, eventually forming a protein.	5913338939b72456491635156fe1ea84	2	2

5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons will recognize the codon in the mRNA and bond their corresponding amino acids. Next, these amino acids are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, creating a chain of amino acids that is as heavy as a lead balloon! Lastly, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA and this mince is as round as a pease.	bc58a28e5ec1c22969ec1e1f6272b567	3	3
5	The mRNA makes its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or sometimes winds up in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's then read in triplets, codons, by the ribosomal RNA.

6	Active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis are processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Active transport requires energy to move a substance against its concentration gradient, while facilitated diffusion uses carrier proteins to move molecules down their concentration gradient. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through the cell membrane and does not require energy.	82883be890afd868e1b6c46853a8a63d	3	3
6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, facilitated diffusion, and selective permeability. Active transport uses energy to move a substance against its concentration gradient, facilitated diffusion utilizes membrane pathways to allow for particles to enter or leave the cell, and selective permeability is when the cell membrane only allows certain molecules to pass through it.	d71dd511ec9d17429bc4b2ffaa13bc57	3	3
6	Pumps, protein channels, and active transport are processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Pumps use energy and carrier proteins to move charged particles, like sodium and potassium ions, through membranes. Protein channels or channel proteins facilitate the movement of specific molecules or substances into and out of the cell. Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.	3cb835b4ca9dbb52f1509215096d51b6	3	3
6	Cells can control the movement of substances across the cell membrane through a variety of mechanisms, including selective permeability, protein channels, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and vesicular transport.	45af9f4a48c0264d347b1459c2060b4e	3	3
6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, protein channels, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport requires energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, whereas protein channels allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell. Lastly, facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.	e30b10f711f5c92da6554192be66db2b	3	3
6	Three primary processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport requires energy to move a substance across the cell membrane against its concentration gradient, while passive transport occurs when a substance moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without requiring energy. Finally, facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.	c75829d06b7ea1ae1b76311d6c6c2505	3	2
6	Cells can control the movement of substances across the cell membrane by using pumps to move ions, proteins channels to facilitate the passage of specific molecules, and active transport to move substances against their concentration gradient, all combining to enable selective permeability.	4e409dd5e253c4b65259593c7e79a5ab	3	3
6	Cell membranes control the movement of substances across it by using osmosis, facilitated diffusion, and selective permeability; however, pumps, protein channels, active and passive transport, endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and exocytosis can also be used.	3b8069cf591e2dae9746834b26ab0b9d	3	3
6	Active transport, osmosis, and passive transport are processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. These processes differ in that active transport requires energy to move a substance from an area of low to high concentration, while osmosis involves the diffusion of water across the cell membrane, and passive transport moves substances from an area of higher to lower concentration.	741248706a2c4e55aeb7c890f8e31392	3	3
6	Cell membranes make use of selective permeability, passive transport, active transport, facilitated diffusion, pumps, channel proteins, vesicles, phagocytosis, endocytosis and osmosis to control the movement of substances.	dc09c19b6ec63be77b0605583598054f	3	3
6	Cells also control the movement of substances across the cell membrane by using ion pumps to move molecules against their concentration gradient, as well as maintaining the selective permeability of the cell membrane to allow certain molecules to move through.	efcfa432a19f8a522eaa91f2d1467843	3	3

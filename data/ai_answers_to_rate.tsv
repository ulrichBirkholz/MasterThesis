5	mRNA begins its journey by exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which acts like a doorway for molecules to enter and exit. From there, it makes its way to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, where codons on the mRNA are read in triplets by rRNA. This information is then used by tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons, to recognize the corresponding codon on the mRNA. As this process continues, amino acids are linked together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site and ending with a STOP codon in the A site.	f5df6eabc6a643bafd581ee23f8f2b2b	-1	3

5	mRNA escapes from nucleus via nuclear pore and heads straight towards a ribosome. Once there, codons are read individually which binds with complementary tRNAs attracting its payload of amino acids for protein synthesis.	e567e38ceb19a921a4baed96d6c4cdc1	-1	0
5	After mRNA is released from nucleus it's taken up by transport proteins and taken over to ribosomes where codons are recognized in quads. This triggers a reaction with complimentary tRNAs bringing their respective payloads of amino acids for addition onto peptide chains.	0d2707a0f7968200ced49feddb91b0ec	-1	0
5	The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, wherein the corresponding amino acid sequence is picked up by tRNA molecules and brought to the ribosome for translation (cynical voice).	5e65007a516573caee5d4483001f6089	-1	1
5	MRNA departs from the nucleus via nuclear pores before arriving at either ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum where it is translated. Its three-base sequences known as codons are matched up with their corresponding anticodons on tRNAs so adjacent amino acids may be linked according to START/STOP signals	61defca2e8435b9d25de287cf388f492	-1	3
5	MRNA starts off in the nucleus before exiting via nuclear pore en route to either ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum where it will find itself being translated. Its 3-base sequences referred to as codons attach themselves to their complementary anticodons found on tRNA molecules thereby connecting adjacent amino acids via START/STOP indicators	3c24f8072c143e67a4c25adf76c8bb2e	-1	3
5	Protein synthesis requires MRNA taking off from nuclei taking advantage of its inherent nuclear gates pointing towards either ribosomes or ERs where translation takes place. Thereupon it decodes its trinucleotide arrangements named 'codons' matching them up accordingly against similar 'anticodons' located within tRNA molecules allowing for connection between aminos guided by established START/STOP procedures.	95af7700dd9171986e8e3ca49c062434	-1	3
5	Getting protein synthesis underway involves MRNA farewelling nuclei using built-in passageways leading outwards towards desired locations including either ribosomes & ERs preparing itself for translation practices. It divides its triple base groupings commonly called 'codons' that fit comfortably alongside analogous 'anticodons' situated inside tRNA molecules paving ways for linkage between aminos powered by programmed START/STOP commands.	fa53a7527e1d1bfba1fa28e62392aeb0	-1	3

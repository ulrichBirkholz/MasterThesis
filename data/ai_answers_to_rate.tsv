5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis occurs in four steps: Initiation, Elongation, Termination and Post-Translational Modifications. Initiation begins with the START codon binding to the P site and a corresponding tRNA bringing the appropriate amino acid. The ribosome then moves along the mRNA strand 'like a dry breeze sweeping through the Karoo' joining the amino acids as it goes. When the STOP codon is encountered, Termination occurs and the protein is released. Last, Post-Translational Modifications occur which can activate or deactivate the protein 'as quickly as a light feather floating away in the wind'. Finally, just like a leopard who doesn't change its spots, the protein is complete.	6999fdf07cd65dd719ab3b067de4542b	3	3

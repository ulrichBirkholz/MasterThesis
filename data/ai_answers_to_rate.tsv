Then tRNA molecules carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons recognize these codons and bond their corresponding amino acids together, creating a protein chain. This process continues until a START codon is read in the P site, initiating protein synthesis; and ends when a STOP codon is read in the A site, completing protein synthesis.	2a70abc59fd268d2c3f98a287fdb5862	-1	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm. The codons are then read in groups of three by rRNA, while tRNA carrying complementary anticodons bond with them. Amino acids are then linked together, starting with a START codon and ending with a STOP codon.	9ae804401226f350cd85930c08d28d95	-1	2
5	To begin protein synthesis, mRNA must first leave the nucleus via nuclear pore before reaching its destination. Codons from this mRNA are read in triplets, followed by tRNA pairing complementary anticodons with corresponding amino acids. When linked together, these amino acids form proteins that begin at START codon and end at STOP codon.	29f48965d9d7e7360d4c4c7255a02c5d	-1	2
5	For protein synthesis to start, mRNA needs to leave its place of origin -the nucleus- and move towards either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum where it will be read by rRNA. Here, triplets of bases known as codons are recognized by their complementary tRNAs carrying anticodons plus amino acids, binding them together until reaching a STOP code.	8175f5c50e88f42bcfdd4220c75ed519	-1	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving its dwelling in the nucleus, protein synthesis occurs when it reaches either ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum for decoding its triplet base sequence (codons) via rRNA into pairs of tRNAs with complementary anticodons connected to amino acids. When STOP code is detected this indicates completion.	c1caecddd015fc68a42ed8477015ec44	-1	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus, traverses through the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome. There, it is translated into codons which are matched with their complementary anticodons on transfer RNAs. The amino acids carried by these transfer RNAs are then joined together in a chain formation, forming a protein that starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon.	72cb3a9b855c4089383dc72e004cd4aa	-1	2
5	The first step of protein synthesis begins when the mRNA transcribed from DNA travels outside the nucleus. It moves through the cytoplasm until it finds a ribosome.

5	To synthesize proteins, mRNA must first exit the nucleus - this is just the beginning.

During this process, codons in the mRNA are read and paired with complementary tRNA molecules that contain matching amino acids. The amino acids get linked together forming a new protein.	fb67a4dd0632c28b3eede78d93cb5229	-1	3
5	The stage for protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds itself to a ribosome where it will be translated into proteins. This process involves reading of its codons and matching them up with complimentary tRNA molecules carrying the necessary amino acid components for stringing them together into one final product.	4d6429cc930c1243a981e4f925f87d02	-1	2
5	mRNA exits nucleus via nuclear pore and is transported to an organelle called the 'ribonucleus'. It then uses its codons to search for complementary tRNA molecules that carry the corresponding amino acids. As these molecules are matched, they are linked together and eventually form a protein.	798e83139ffe5783a84d16cabe5617f4	-1	2
5	Codons on mRNA are read by rRNA in triplets determining the respective complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons of the tRNA. The tRNA brings in the required amino acids until a STOP codon is detected. The newly formed protein is then liberated from the ribosome.	2efca39352093d80634e042f7a29f9a4	-1	2
5	As soon as mRNA leaves the nucleus via nuclear pore it attaches itself to ribosomes which then break the mRNA down into its base pairs. Each base pair acts as a cue for nearby tRNAs with complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons that bring in their respective amino acid chains until a STOP codon halts any further progress.	a02b12ce7c3cdd80c8e3c838d2976073	-1	3
5	mNRNA slips out of nucleus into cytoplasm and attaches itself to ribosomes interpreting sequences composed of seven nucleotides. With its accompanying anti-codons, tRNA find their equivalents on mRNA allowing for amino acids to be put together one after another until an END code appears, resulting in completion of protein synthesis.	330de07ee62989f8f7e1eb4b27c64b22	-1	0
5	2. mRNA is read by the rRNA in triplets called codons, which are then matched with complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules. The tRNA’s attached amino acid bonds itself to the next amino acid, forming a chain of amino acids that creates a protein when the STOP codon is reached.	7cffaed08a0303c7544eab5175383fa0	-1	1
5	The process of protein synthesis starts by sending mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome, where its sequence of codons is translated into a sequence of amino acids. Each codon is matched with a tRNA molecule carrying a complimentary anticodon and the amino acid bonded to its 3' end. These amino acids are linked together in order to form a polypeptide chain.	d1482cbb9a2a17cc566370bd78e73b1e	-1	2
5	mRNA is secreted from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it binds to ribosomes and initiates translation, by which a set of codons are read and converted to amino acids which are then arranged in a chain, forming a protein. This is known as the initiation stage.	9c1750d7c9daa9f8904abb6d8fba1817	-1	1
5	Beginning in the nucleus, mRNA molecules are guided through a series of pathways until they reach their destination ribosome. Here, the mRNA binds with a specialized protein that reads its bases in triplets called codons. The tRNA also carries complementary anticodons, joining each codon to create an amino acid chain that eventually forms a protein.	1819f60ee38ffaddae55bbad8631f708	-1	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis is constructed around a series of complicated steps and processes. It requires an intricate arrangement of tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognizing codon triplets from the mRNA strand in order to form peptide bonds which join together distinct amino acids.	2095d27d3545e2b4cf9016ded337cd40	-1	3
5	The process begins when mRNA departs from nucleus and ends once a STOP codon signals its completion. In between those two points, there exists three distinct acts: tRNAs bind to their respective complementary anticodons found on mRNA; amino acids join each other forming proteins; and START/STOP codons are identified.	f53dddb4cc22dc4bf9d36d124df46de4	-1	2
5	The first step in protein synthesis is mRNA exiting from the nucleus and travelling through cytoplasm to reach its destination at ribosomes. Then, codons on mRNA are read in triplets by rRNA which helps tRNA recognize complementary codons and link together their respective amino acids, finally ending when a STOP codon is found.	7823c8cb5a2eca5a612b861ddff8990b	-1	3
5	In order for protein synthesis to start, it all begins with mRNA exiting from nuclei; like a spark that lights up the entire process! Following this, rRNA reads triplets from said mRNA which helps tRNA recognize complementary codons and subsequently form chains of amino acids until reaching its final destination when encountering a STOP codon.	812e0e76ac1a5ef920be77907fb732b7	-1	3
5	mRNA escapes from prison - aka the nucleus - before hitting the highway of cytoplasm to find its match at the ribosome. Codons are read in triplets and complementary anticodons must be found on tRNA if protein synthesis is to succeed! The tRNA then links amino acids together and this process continues till a STOP codon is reached, marking the end of protein synthesis.	3d36d47ad3c92e97772dbdb39fd8aa5a	-1	3
5	So here we have mRNA leaving behind the safety of its beloved nucleus for something more exciting out on cytoplasm highway. In order to make any progress with building proteins though, it needs to meet up with ribosomes that can interpret it using codons. Complementary anticodons on specialised tRNA must also arrive at scene before any linking up of amino acids can take place - ending only when a STOP codon appears.	333f13dddcf62d61a60da63d9d0bd568	-1	3

5	The journey of protein synthesis starts upon exit from the nucleus where, via a nuclear pore, mRNA journeys into the cytoplasm. The codons present on the mRNA are read by ribosomal RNA in triplets. To ensure complementary base pairing, tRNA loaded with an anticodon recognizes the complimentary codon on the mRNA and transfers its attached amino acid along with others added consecutively onto the growing polypeptide chain until a STOP codon signals termination of elongation.	65dd871035a0f3be93cfa53e9039dc92	-1	3
5	mRNA leaves nucleus via nuclear pore and reaches ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. rRNA reads the mRNA codons while a tRNA with complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon binds to it.

5	Leaving the nucleus is like moving from childhood into adulthood; mRNA sheds its identity as DNA and takes on an entirely new role in protein synthesis. During this transition, it links up with tRNA carrying complementary anticodons that recognize codons on the mRNA and add amino acids. Eventually, these molecules join together until a complete protein is created, marked by a STOP codon.	1c5e9723a18e38963b4066878853508b	-1	3
5	The commencement point of protein synthesis is when mRNA leaves nucleus based on which its code words are interpreted by r RNA containing ribosome using three letter groupings.

5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA's departure from nucleus via nuclear pore.

Chain elongates until stop codon is recognized in A-site.	ce573fb7fbc0e38bac7b2bd9e2019980	-1	2
5	Protein synthesis commences after mRNA's egress from nucleus via nuclear pore.

5	To begin protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm. At this point, it may go to a ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases are read as codons by ribosomal RNA, which will then bind with tRNA molecules carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodons that fit the codon sequence. The resulting combination then creates a chain of amino acids that form proteins beginning with a START codon in the P site and ending with a STOP codon in the A site.	edda604ad9ea6af50b3e0da2806cfb98	-1	2
5	Molecular messengers (mRNA) travel from within the nucleus outwardly via a nuclear pore. As they pass from one realm to another, they are decoded by rRNA molecules that match them with complimentary anti-codons on tRNA molecules.

5	At first, messenger RNA finds itself enclosed within its birthplace of the nucleus until it exits through a nuclear pore taking it out into another realm-the cytoplasm. Having made its way there, it can now have its codon sequence interpreted by ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) that connect it up to matching anti-codons found on transfer RNAs (tRNAs). These bonds between amino acids result in forming proteins.	a7c83a706805ce70f1e39baee4ccad8e	-1	3
5	Emerging from its home, mRNA is faced with a puzzle only it can solve.

5	The mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus, carrying the genetic message from DNA to ribosomes where protein synthesis occurs. Codons, which are groups of three nucleotide bases in a particular sequence, found on the mRNA are then translated into amino acids and linked together. This process involves a tRNA recognising the codon on the mRNA and bringing the corresponding amino acid. A START codon is then read by the ribosome, initiating protein synthesis which ends with a STOP codon.	a634ea52a79f57802a5b1a769ed5ab29	-1	3
5	Exit of mRNA from nucleus initiates protein synthesis taking place within ribosomes.

These codons guide the assembly of amino acids which are added one by one until a STOP codon is recognized in the A site; this denotes the end of elongation and termination. The tRNA molecules then join the corresponding amino acids to form a chain that is transferred through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	8e0bc791573b1d4f478b4f65b49c0653	3	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus like a beaver's dam breaking free, twisted and winding its way through the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	The journey of mRNA from leaving the nucleus involves four important steps. Firstly, a tRNA carrying its complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon searches for the corresponding codon in the mRNA molecule. Secondly, the initiation process starts when a START codon is read on the mRNA in the P site. Thirdly, the linked amino acids continue to be added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.

5	The mRNA transcribed in the nucleus heads out to sea, so to speak, and sails through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, where it gets pulled ashore at the start codon. The next four steps get denser than chowder: tRNA bringing amino acids to the A site links up with complementary codons, and then the polypeptide chain's elongation and termination continues until a STOP codon is read in the A site. Sharper than a Sox fan's wit, the resulting sequence of amino acids is higher than Hancock Tower - and voila, a protein!	fcfa9c97340e1e822d8f8756dc280def	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering either the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During the initiation process, a START codon is read on the mRNA in the P site, and a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. The mRNA is then read in triplets called codons by rRNA. As this occurs, the amino acids continue to be linked together until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, indicating termination of protein synthesis.	414331621aa462ac26b3daa98d921d3f	3	3

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four major steps of protein synthesis are initiation, in which a START codon in the P site is read and a corresponding amino acid is added to tRNA; elongation and termination, where additional amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is read; and finally transport of the mRNA through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	4e6d2aaad1a16003f8bc0f00c9b7aaf9	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and continuing on within the cell, where each codon is read in sets of three by rRNA. This allows for the corresponding amino acid to be delivered via tRNA, forming a chain which continues to grow until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling termination of the process.	dcbd88c1a9e910176a18bc66d64cf288	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, where it travels to the ribosome. Once there, a corresponding tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid binds to the mRNA in the A site. After that, the ribosome moves along the mRNA and a new amino acid is added to the tRNA in the A site, and the tRNA molecule in the P site is moved to the E site. This process continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	3ff72479686f0541aacf86d68addefd5	3	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves 4 major steps: 1. mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, 2. tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, 3. A new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA and 4. Amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site and ending with a STOP codon in the A site.	52d986f90e471fe2d535667750539fc5	3	3
5	The mRNA containing the genetic code exits the nucleus through the nuclear pore and binds to a tRNA molecule which contains a complementary anticodon that recognizes the codon on the mRNA. This triggers a process of linking amino acid molecules together, starting with the START codon in the P site, to create a protein.	b2d4db2c1eeae0bb28442a2214d07f53	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with the translation of mRNA into amino acids, which are then joined together to form polypeptides. The polypeptides are then folded into proteins, which are packaged for transport and released from the cell.	d1ca6a81449bd5ad4110b5f593a4c892	3	2
5	mRNA exits the nucleus via the nuclear pore, enters the cytoplasm and is read in triplets called codons by ribosomal RNA. A tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the codon and brings the matching amino acid to the ribosome - this process is known as 'translation' and leads to a sequence of amino acids being linked together to make a protein, which starts with a START codon in the P-site.	154e4e998b65a5bc8fbd5d3f10e8fc51	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA, which is composed of codons that are read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). tRNA then bonds the corresponding amino acids together to form a chain. At the start of the process, the START codon binds to the P site on the ribosome and initiates the formation of a protein.	f5ca7fbe4acaede94ac1281e07b44aa8	3	1
5	Protein synthesis is like a production line: mRNA, the blueprint, leaves the nucleus and enters the ribosome to transcribe the instructions, creating a growing chain of amino acids which are then modified, folded and packaged by other organelles - finally the protein is released into the cytoplasm.	be661ac047e5c7ced7f4f71f74a72297	3	3
5	mRNA, after leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, travels to either a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum where new amino acids are added to its tRNA, continuing until a STOP codon is read on mRNA in the A site, thus marking the end of protein synthesis.	eaa8cf86746014a189f5177b7cd1097d	3	2
5	Protein synthesis can be thought of as a factory line: mRNA is the raw material that enters the nucleus, and from there it is transcribed to form a template for tRNA to gather amino acids like workers collecting resources. Ribosomes then construct the protein like assembly machines, and finally a signal sequence helps attach the protein to its final destination, like a postman delivering a package.	5bc5baa8b25d5fe7180327d4768bf681	3	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes through the nuclear pore. Once it reaches the ribosome, tRNA carrying complementary anticodons binds with the codons on the mRNA. The joining of codons and amino acids continues until a stop codon is reached, at which point protein synthesis is complete.	1e97a179d6286aecdfba5facecc986f9	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where it is read by ribosomes and translated into amino acids.

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is then read in triplets known as codons by rRNA. tRNA carrying a complimentary anticodon binds to the codon on the mRNA and the corresponding amino acids become bonded together, forming a protein that begins with a START codon once it reaches the P site.	7afe87f355291e74d8fab35dc960ada2	3	2
5	mRNA is transcribed and leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Once in the cytoplasm, mRNA binds to a ribosome which reads the codons and begins to link amino acids together in an elongation step. This continues until a STOP codon is read, allowing for termination of the protein synthesis.	ed044ea486f966e21b31b99ee564a1b7	3	2
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. There, a tRNA anticodon binds to the complementary mRNA codon and carries an amino acid that will be incorporated into a growing peptide chain. This continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, at which point the polypeptide chain is terminated and released from the ribosome.	23eefb92400513966252ce87258f2f2d	3	3
5	mRNA first exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then it is translated into tRNA molecules, which carry amino acids to the ribosome where the mRNA is decoded and the polypeptides are linked together. Finally, these polypeptides are folded and modified into proteins ready for use.	ab22c50036aabbc2483acf3fb9f17788	3	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, four major steps in protein synthesis are: 1) mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons; 2) tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA; 3) a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA; and 4) the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded together as swiftly as a Calgary wind, twisted like Toronto's streets and changeable as Maritime weather, until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.	f02b9a2dd97179aaf889db94377fa6b0	3	3

5	Protein synthesis begins with an mRNA molecule leaving the nucleus, which is then read by a ribosome in a process called translation. During this process, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to the ribosome and link them together according to the mRNA code in a process called initiation, elongation, and termination.	9c5e000b91f0e20673e9bf741942e3d9	3	3
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then codons on the mRNA are read in triplets by rRNA in the P site, and amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is read in the A site. This process of linking amino acids continues until the protein is completed.	b76bb64bdd49120b8e5b775931ba6b20	3	3
5	mRNA exits the nucleus, tRNA ferries amino acids to the ribosome, codon on mRNA is matched with anticodon on tRNA, a new corresponding amino acid is added - all this on the never never!	caedc7a7197f3363e9bcb80958103f8f	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, before travelling through the cytoplasm and entering the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the ribosome, initiation of protein production is initiated with a start codon in the P site, followed by amino acids linking together until a stop codon is read in the A site, and thus termination of protein production.	0f81ab57202ab5f9ca5756cbe73932af	3	3
5	Protein synthesis is like a four-stage journey: first, mRNA leaves the nucleus as a roadmap; second, it is read and interpreted by ribosomes to build the protein; third, tRNA brings the necessary 'ingredients' from the cytoplasm; and fourth, a catalytic enzyme helps the new protein fold correctly.	8dc8923044728d9d9a87b03dfcb4e81e	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes translation into a polypeptide chain by linking amino acids from the tRNA molecules in the ribosome. This process of elongation and termination continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.	84bee08860846ef20592cb2e27f34aa7	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching itself to a ribosome, where it is translated into a sequence of amino acids. The amino acids are then transferred to tRNA molecules, which transfer them to the ribosome. Once there, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, like pieces of a puzzle forming a polypeptide chain. Finally, the polypeptide is released and folded into an active protein, as cold as a Yukon winter or as twisted as Toronto's streets yet as hot as Toronto in July.	b63d60f4e731aadfb86328639cb71441	3	3
5	Protein synthesis consists of four major steps: transcription, where mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus; translation, where amino acids are sequentially added to the growing polypeptide chain based on the codons present on mRNA in the ribosome; elongation, where the polypeptide chain continues to be built with addition of more amino acids; and termination when a STOP codon on mRNA is read in the A site and the polypeptide chain is released.	128234dbec7102072b9cfb4345f1f0b5	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via nuclear pore, forms complementary codons with tRNA molecules to carry the amino acids to the ribosome, gets read by ribosome and assembled into a protein chain with adjacent amino acids bonded together, and finally is discharged from ribosome as a completed protein.	a71364a6fd0f7c88a0af33955f012509	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum where a tRNA molecule carrying a new corresponding amino acid is added while codons in the mRNA are read, allowing START codon in the P site (initiation) to link amino acids together until a complete protein is formed.	4bc537b4e2716775dc3df18123ec9d10	3	3
5	The first step is for mRNA to leave the nucleus and arrive in the cytoplasm. Then, tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids bind to mRNA codons in the ribosome, forming a peptide bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. This is followed by further elongation of the polypeptide chain as tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize complementary codons on the mRNA. Finally, the completed polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome.	b56ea3c7914acc44300bca396b7f146e	3	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and is processed in the ribosome, where tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the codon of the mRNA. The resulting amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain which is then folded and modified into a functional protein.	9b6b779141feb1d38aca765347c198d6	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome, where codons are read in triplets by rRNA. This is followed by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizing the complementary codon of the mRNA, which then links amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA. This process of linking amino acids is called elongation and termination.	6bceab52ff16c4b73e33e8dcc31130d9	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it binds with a ribosome. tRNA brings the corresponding amino acid to the ribosome and links them together in the A site. The mRNA moves one codon across the ribosome's P site, allowing the next tRNA to join with its corresponding amino acids in the A site. The ribosome then catalyses a peptide bond between amino acids at the P and A sites, forming a polypeptide chain which is released from the ribosome when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, completing protein synthesis as steady as a Canuck's resolve.	e7bbd7db64a71d57995591d858b42bb7	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, allowing tRNA molecules with complementary anticodons to recognize their corresponding codons and attach a new corresponding amino acid. This process is repeated until the polypeptide chain is formed.	31f5581a78aef1781681442a180920c0	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, where it is then transported to the ribosome, where its sequence is read and translated into amino acids that are linked together to form a protein chain, which is then modified by post-translational modifications before being secreted from the cell.	58ab1a4cec755fe5e5abf1b9aa6f493c	3	3
5	The protein synthesis process is as strong as a lion: starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, then a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA and finally the amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site (initiation), cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey!	c04bb0f748e1c890cbab26ae287beacc	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA enters the nucleus, where it is processed and modified. Then, it travels to the ribosome, where it is translated into a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide chain is folded into its correct shape and transported out of the ribosome, where enzymes attach functional groups and modify the molecule further. Finally, the protein is exported out of the cell.	f6473e0dbd76ae54865d447518cafe2a	3	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and binds to ribosomes, where it is decoded by tRNA molecules.

5	mRNA leaving the nucleus binds to a ribosome, which synthesizes a protein using amino acid building blocks from the environment.

6	Cell membranes contain proteins which act as channels and allow the movement of ions, molecules, and water across the membrane. This is known as osmosis.	3437388f7fa121dc51d422c8485054a0	2	2
6	Cells control the movement of substances across their membrane in three ways: Membrane-assisted transport, which uses the cell membrane to force large molecules out with exocytosis, passive transport, which moves substances from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, and endocytosis which engulfs molecules by the cell membrane.	c78ec6e051f6ae49d90112329fada445	2	3
6	Cell membranes use selective permeability to permit certain substances to cross, pumps and carrier proteins to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions, osmosis for the diffusion of water, membrane-assisted transport such as exocytosis and phagocytosis, and facilitated diffusion to control passage into or out of the cell - all as wet as an otter's pocket and not arseways like being on the never never.	d3bd5410ddc1e6dd31e2c2c092de6241	3	3
6	Active transport, osmosis, and selective permeability are processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.

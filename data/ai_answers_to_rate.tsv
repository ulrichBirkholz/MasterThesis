5	Protein synthesis is like a factory assembly line. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the four major steps involve decoding the genetic instructions, assembling the amino acids into a polypeptide chain, folding into a 3D shape and post-translational modification.	c0ce4436bf25f91bd8c0ae53cef17fd1	3	3
5	mRNA exits the nucleus via nuclear pore, then amino acids are linked together in the ribosome until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, completing protein synthesis.	890aecf24265d8cf40d6677a445b1b07	3	3
5	Amino acids are added to the mRNA in the nucleus, then linked one after another on the ribosome at the A site. The tRNA brings corresponding amino acids to the elongation and termination sites of the ribosome until a STOP codon is read, which signals the end of protein synthesis.	5576d73c3c087d8158761ee496506264	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is decoded by ribosomes into amino acid sequences; tRNA binds to the codons on the mRNA in the A site while the peptide bond forms between the two adjacent amino acids in the P site. The ribosome then moves along the mRNA codon by codon, as tRNA brings in more amino acids and forms a growing polypeptide chain. Amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, thus concluding protein synthesis.	7a1d2a84f7da724dad9ba66edfec39fc	3	3

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore and entering the cytoplasm. The codons of the mRNA are then read by rRNA in the ribosome, where tRNA molecules with complementary anticodons recognize and bring in the correct amino acids.

6	Cells use a variety of processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, such as membrane-assisted transport (e.g. endocytosis, phagocytosis and exocytosis), passive transport, facilitated diffusion, pumps, osmosis, active transport and selective permeability.	d101b5db9d5c9f7da41d54ab91db624e	3	3
6	Cellular control of movement across the cell membrane can be achieved through facilitated diffusion, selective permeability and active transport. Facilitated diffusion allows the membrane to control the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell, selective permeability enables the cell to selectively allow certain molecules through the membrane, while active transport is when energy is used by the cell in order to move a substance across the membrane against its natural concentration gradient.	45e0cfb4bc41a8e4065de0cb93934913	3	3
6	Active transport occurs when a cell expends energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient. Additionally, passive transport relies on the kinetic energy of molecules and can include diffusion or facilitated diffusion. Lastly, endocytosis is a process used by cells to move substances into the cell by forming vesicles around them.	562db130ece438c9ff43cac725c01ebc	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, facilitated diffusion and protein channels. Active transport requires energy to move a substance from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.

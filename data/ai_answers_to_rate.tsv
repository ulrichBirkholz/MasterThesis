5	Starting off with mRNA transcribed from DNA moving out from nuclear walls, protein synthesis involves four distinctive steps: translation using cellular machinery powered by ATP taking place at ribosomes whilst being simultaneously charged by specified sets of amino acid particles; ensuing production of peptidic connections between these residues eventually leading up to construction of one large molecular structure - a so called polypeptide chain.	d6a2b6ca6ab1e87896595dd199710b93	-1	3
5	As its first phase protein synthesis necessitates RNA initially generated via transcription to exit nuclear envelope boundaries. Subsequently come four successive activities: translation conducted via cellular machinery powered by ATP taking place at ribosomes while simultaneously charged by particular sets of amino acid particles thereby eventually producing peptidic bridges between them leading up to composition of giant molecules labelled as 'polypeptide chains'.	a52aefac331706026fc849cd93e8548c	-1	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis is a process that consists of four main steps. Firstly, mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Then, the tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome which join together to form polypeptides. Thirdly, the ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and link together amino acids accordingly resulting in a primary structure for the protein. Finally, post-translational modifications can occur to alter the overall shape and characteristics of the final protein.	8438d5b3e13fabf03b476bf358f991e7	-1	2
5	mRNA first travels away from the nucleus and binds to a ribosome, where it's then transcribed into a protein. The ribosome reads the mRNA and translates it into amino acids which are then connected in the right order to form the protein.	613c1c96d9bbc5dedc3ba882cb75df8a	-1	1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching itself onto a ribosome. This mRNA contains codes that determine which amino acids will be incorporated into the newly synthesized protein. Next, the RNA is translated by the ribosome into amino acids that are linked together to form a polypeptide chain. Finally, this molecule is folded up and post-translational modifications take place.	a8b3febbe516d956446880517df8fad3	-1	2
5	Before proteins can be generated, first mRNA must exit its origin in the nucleus and bind itself to a ribosome for interpretation.

5	At the start of protein synthesis, mRNA exits the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome.

5	The process of generating a protein begins with mRNA travelling out of the nucleus and being recognized by a ribosome. tRNA molecules attach themselves to specific amino acids, and make sure they arrive at the right spot on the ribosome.

6	Active transport involves the movement of molecules with the help of proteins, allowing for the cell to control which substances can enter it.	ab69ce7265b2c8dfbbc02e76b681f023	-1	3
6	1. Cells use diffusion to allow molecules to move freely from one side of the membrane to the other, depending on their concentration gradient. 2. Osmosis is a process where cells take in solutes from their environment in order to maintain a balance between the inside and outside concentrations of the cell. 3. Endocytosis and exocytosis are active transport processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane against a concentration gradient.	477ae38c4824df495c2d090897735b5d	-1	3

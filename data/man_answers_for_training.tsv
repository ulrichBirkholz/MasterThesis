5	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.	12396	1	1

The tRNA attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more tRNA come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the tRNA is let go. By the end of the RNA chain a long string of amino acids has been created	11425	1	1
5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell.  It moves to a ribosome.  The ribosome makes tRNA.  Then, protien is synthesized.	11806	1	1
5	After leaving the nucleus there are a few steps in protein synthesis.  mRNA enters the ribosome and prepares for transcription.  In transcription the enzyme, RNA polymerase binds to DNA and splits the two strands apart.  It then uses one strand as a template for nucleotides to form a strand of RNA.  Then it has to go into translation.  mRNA is used as instructions for decoding.  The ribosome is what makes the protein.	11837	1	1
5	1.mRNA start a process called translation2.tRNA bring Adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine to the site3.The bases are attached to the mRNA creating a nucleotide4.The nucleotides are folded into their proper shape.	12351	1	1
5	Step 1 the mrna goes out and grabs the sequence that is needed. Step2 the mrna sequnce choosen then codes for tranlation. The trna then takes the base pair codes and goes out and grabs the aminoacids.Step3 the amino acid sequence would then be added to the original. Step4 a new strand with a new sequence would be formed.	11766	1	1
5	The mRNA enters the cytoplasm. The mRNA attaches to ribosomes. Then an anticodon (transport RNA) attaches to the mRNA codons matching the sequence of nucleotides. The process shifts and continues to produce proteins.	12209	1	1
5	First, the protein makes a copy of its self, which is RNA.Second, the protein travels to the ribosome, which is tRNA.Third, the ribosome reads the mRNA and breaks it down into smaller, three part pieces called codons. The mRNA is broken down by peptide bonds.Lastly, the codons, the smaller parts, are read and are formed into the protein, and the protein is formed.	12739	1	1
5	Firstly, the RNA strand travels to the ribosomes. Secondly, the Start codon starts the building of the protein. Thirdly, tRNA comes and builds the protein. Lastly, the Stop codon comes along and ends the production of the protein	12100	1	1
5	First, the mRNA takes the genetic code to the tRNA.  Then the mRNA attaches itself to the tRNA.  Next, the mRNA inscribes the code into the tRNA.  Finally, the mRNA releases itself and goes back to recieve more of the code.	12600	1	1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps that go on in order for proteins to function properly.                The mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosome where ribosmal RNA is present, also known as rRNA. The rRNA then goes to the nuclues where proteins are stored. Then the amino acids bond and then you have a protein.     That is the complete protein synthesis.	12140	1	1
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and it transferred to the ribosome.After the mRNA arrives copies begin being made in the ribosome.After the copies are made they are sent out of the ribosomes and can be used for just about anything.But they can also be transferred back to the nucleus to be used for reproduction.	12605	1	1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, these four major steps are involved in protein synthesis:1)Ribosomes (or rRNA) attach to the strand of mRNA.2)tRNA (transport ribonucleic acid) attaches to the mRNA with a specific anticodon holding a special amino acid for that mRNA sequence.3)Once one anticodon is attached, that tRNA releases itself from the mRNA, for only one tRNA can be on at a time.4)Once the new protein is formed, the ribosomes lets go of the mRNA and release the newly formed protein into the cytoplasm of the cell.	11159	1	1
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus, then the mRNA goes to the ribosomes.  The mRNA is then translated into DNA.  The DNA makes a strand of proteins.	12472	1	1
5	It travels throught the ER then the Golgi Apperatus.	11926	1	1
5	1) mRNA leaves the nucleus.2) mRNA travels into the cytoplasm 3) mRNA is translated into tRNA 4)tRNA makes another strand to make another cell.	12096	1	0
5	the mRNA is decoded and ine infermation is copied and used to creat the protiens	11801	1	1
5	The first thing it does is that is travels throught the cells cytoplasm to to ribosomes. Then the ribosomes help turn it into protein. The protein is taken my tRNA back to the nucleus and then the prosess starts all over again.	11794	1	1
5	The first step is the mRNA going to the ribosome. The mRNA is then turned to tRNA after going through transcription. After translation, the tRNA is turned into codons which code for amino acids.	12486	1	1
5	mRNA goes to the ribosome, where it hands tRNA the code for the protein. tRNA then travels a gets the needed code. After that it goes back to the ribosome where it hands of the supplies and gets another code.	11142	1	1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm. From there the tRNA comes into play and then it goes on to form a ploypeptide chain. After all of that, protein synthesis is complete.	11035	1	1
5	the mRNA leaves the nucleas and goes to tRNA which transfers the codons and anticodons then which gets translated into a sequence which produces amino acids and then in the sequence makes proteins.	11722	1	1
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. There the mRNA then tell the tRNA the code to create the proteins. Then the tRNA starts to make the protiens. And finally the proteins are sent out to do their job.	12241	1	1
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it will turn into tRNA. This tRNA will then continue towards the mitochondria. After it reaches the protein, the message from the RNA will tell the mitochondria how and what kind of protein is needed. Then this will form a link of amino acids to form the protein needed.	12651	1	1
5	Two of the major steps involved in protein synthesis are transcription and translation. Transcription is when the DNA zips open and then the mRNA connects to it. After the mRNA connects to the DNA, the mRNA leaves the cell and goes to the endoplasmic riticulum where the ribosomes are. There is meets up with the tRNA. This process is called Translation.	12673	1	1
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to into the Endoplasmic Reticulum.  It travels through the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi Apparatus.  There, the Golgi Apparatus decides where the mRNA should go, and then sends it to the ribosomes.  When the mRNA arrives at the nucleus, it is made into a protein.	12567	1	1
5	The mRNA will reach a ribosome. The tRNA will find the amino acid that the mRNA needs. The amino acids will stick together. A protein will be made out of the amino acid strand.	11976	1	1
5	The mRNA decodes DNA, then takes the code to the cytoplasm, then takes it to the ribosomes to produce function and then takes it to the tRNA to decode and produce protiens/	11464	1	1
5	Transcription, DNA is transcribed into mRNA so it can leave the nuclear membrane. The mRNA passes through the nuclear membrane.The mRNA travels on the endoplasmic riticulum to the ribosome.The ribosome reads the mRNA to figure out what type of protein to make.	12098	1	1
5	-mRNA leaves the Nucleus-mRNA travels to the Endoplasmic reticulum	11355	1	1
5	After leaving the nucleus, the RNA is copied. The bases for RNA are adenine, uracil, cytonine, and guanine. Then the bases are read as a codon. The codons are attached by amino acids. Finally, the new RNA strand is taken to the ribosomes to make proteins.	11365	1	1
5	The nucloetides leave the nucleous and make more protein, then the nucloetides enter the nucleous into DNA and transports the codons to the anticodons.	11300	1	0
5	The DNA is copied by the mRNA. Then is translated by the tRNA. then for every 3 strands of codons are translated an amino acid chain is formed. Then when the code for stop happens a protein is formed.	11829	1	1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum, which filters the bad protiens out, then it is released into the cytoplasma of the cell, then it leaves the cell and transports diferent material to a different cell.	11810	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the  nucleus. Then it enters the cytoplam, and proceeds to the ER.	10978	1	1
5	As the mRNA leaves the nuclear pore a rRNA comes and aids the process. The tRNA comes and has complementary codons to make a amino acid. Then another tRNA comes and copies the next segment on the mRNA to makes a different amino acid. This is done with the ribosomal RNA at each segment being copied. After doing this process for awhile it forms a polypeptide or protien.	11610	1	2
5	DNA separates and an RNA strand is paired with DNA strandThe RNA is taken to the ribosomeThe RNA is then changed to mRNAThen the mRNA is tranlated into tRNAand then you have a strand of RNA	11568	1	0

5	the mRNA moves across th cytoplasm.then it gets the the cytoplasm were it reads the mRNA to make a copy of itthe copy is make to tRNA to make amino acid.then the ribosome makes the amino acid to make protein	12494	1	0
5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it finds a portion of DNA, and uses an enzyme to 'unzip it'. The mRNA then copies the bases of the DNA to form a new strand of RNA. When the new RNA is made its nucleotides code for amino acids, so it attaches to an codon which makes the amino acids, which form protiens.	11321	1	1
5	1. The trna attaches itself to the mrna2.The mrna takes the trna to the line of nuleic acids.3. the mrna detatches onto the line.4. the trna attacthes a new ribosome to itself back to the nuleus to start over.	11512	1	1
5	The mRNA then travels to a ribosome and attaches to it. One of end of the mRNA goes into the ribosome and tRNA attaches the corresponding nucleotides to the end. Once the mRNA has been coded the corresponding RNA is then copied again to get the correct sequence. The newly made protein is then released from the ribosome.	11386	1	1
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes to leave the cell. Once the ribosomes leave the cell through the cell membrane that is dissappearing, it goes and attaches itself to the codon strand. Once at the strand, it copies the data that will then be sent to get the anticodon strand to match up and make a protein.	12650	1	1
5	the mRNA travels to the ribosomes. there the ribosomes will transcribe the mRNA into amino acids. The amino acids than go back to the nucleus. And the proccess starts over again with the nucleus decidding what amino acids it needs.	12720	1	1

5	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes then it sends signals up up to the anticodons. It then reads them and sends singnals down to the amino acids the then connect together with peptide bonds and form a protein molelcule.	11265	1	1
5	The mRNA is read by RNA polymerase, tRNA anticodons match up with the codons on the mRNA strand, There is a bond between the mRNA and the tRNA, and the tRNA break off to form a sequence of amino acids.	12546	1	1
5	after the mRNA leaves the nucleus it binds with the rRNA. after they bind together they begin transciption to make more copies for more protiens. After transcription occurs translation begins to decode the RNA that has been made . After this has been done the RNA then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens.	11702	1	1

5	The mRNA must bond with a tRNA first and then get the tRNA anticodon to match up with the codon on mRNA.  This means AGC will have to be pair with UCG.  Then after they break off the tRNA breaks off from the mRNA and goes to the ribsomes for them to make the proteins from the animo acids. Basically it is Transcription, Translocation, and then transferring the proteins to the ribsomes to make the protein. To make the protein the ribsomes must match them in that certain order, which with a new RNA molecule, rRNA, and recieve the information from the tRNA and make the protein with chemicals.	12699	1	1

5	all T's are tuned int U's. the mRNA is translated into codons. codons ar turned into ameno acids. ameno acids are turned into a proteins	11776	1	1
5	First, DNA responsible for this unzip, and nitrogen bases pair up with the DNA bases. The mRNA takes this section to tRNA to form codons that can be used in protein synthesis. The codons are matched up with anticodons at ribosomes, and amino acids are made from these. When the amino acids are completed and form the right chain, they are traken and used for their needed purpose.	12228	1	1
5	First translation starts. Then the codons are made. Codons are matched up. Finaly RNA starts again.	11655	1	0
5	mRNA takes the transcribed code from DNA to find a ribosome. Once the ribosome is found, the tRNA reads the stranscribed code. This is called translation. After the code is read, the ribosomes send off the code to begin making proteins. Now begins the step of protein synthesis.	11187	1	1
5	mRNA attaches to protiens which go to the ribosomes. There, the mRNA turned into tRNA. Each tRNA gets an antibody that codes for DNA. Once they code, the left over protien is shipped out of the cell and the cycle starts over again.	11038	1	0
5	The mRNA will arrive at the ribosome with a message to make proteins. The proteins will begin to duplicate its chromosomes. Then the outer membrane will reform and it will have made two new proteins. Then tRNA will transfer the newly split proteins to wherever they are needed.	11012	1	1
5	it gose to a ribosome, and a tRNA links up with the ribosom/mRNA to make a specific protien, the protien gets attached to another over and over again to from a protien chain.	11671	1	1
5	mRNA must travel to the ribosomes.Then it must turn information into a readable secquence so that the T cells can read it.	11367	1	1
5	mRNA leaves nucleus.mRNA is decoded and transported by the tRNAAmino acid is formedProtein is made	12478	1	0
5	mRNA attatches to a ribosome then the ribosome makes the protein its told to make. After that the protien is sent to the Rough E.R. then after that it is altered a little bit and sent out to the Golgi Apparatus. Then the Golgi Apparatussends the protien to where it has to go and then the protien starts doing its job.	12347	1	1
5	The mRNA goes RRNA and gives them instruvtions from DNA for the amino acid sequence . Ribosomal RNA makes the ribosomes. TRNA puts the proteins into order to match them up with their correct codon. Prpteins match up with the correct codon, which makes the identical sequence to what DNA needs.	12404	1	1
5	The first step is leaving the nucleus. This step is important because the mRNA goes through the nuclear pores to go to the cell. The next step is sending the message through the cell.	11457	1	1
5	transcription, ribosome calls for amino acids, translation. proteins are made by the amino acids binding together.	11823	1	1
5	The first step is where the mRNA goes to the ribosones  soo they DNA can be replicated. The second step is wjere the tRNA gets added with the DNA. The third step is  when the tRNA foes back to the nucleus to get added to the DNA. i cant remember the last.	11743	1	1
5	1. The mRNA is split in half.2. One half of the mRNA runs through a ribosome.3. While the half of the mRNA is being ran through the ribosome, a protien is being made according to the instructions. 4. The protien travels to wherever it is 'programmed' to go, and to do whatever it is 'programmed' to do.	11699	1	1
5	1. mRNA is transported to the ribosomes2. rRNA matches it with the amino acid that corresponds to form proteins	11607	1	1

5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome. Where tRNA then translates the mRNA into proteins.	11755	1	1
5	In protein synthesis, the mRNA must first leave the nucleus. It then goes to the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. From there, it attaches to its complimentary codon. And finally becomes a protein strand.	11703	1	1
5	The mRNA transports the information to the ribosome.Next the ribosome takes the mRNA, with the info, and starts to produce the protien.After that the ribosome created an amino acid sequence to produce the protien.Finally, the protien is produced, from the amino acid sequence,  and is shipped to different parts of the cell, so the cell can function properly	11105	1	1
5	First, the mRNA is released into the body. Then the mRNA attaches itself to ribosomes. Thirdly, the mRNA grows to the biggest size in can go. Lastly, when the mRNA is done growing, it will be delivered to the lysosome where it will be disposed of.	12462	1	1
5	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then an enzyme unzipps the mRNA. The third step is an amino acids line up with the corresponding codons. When it reaches the stop codon the amino acids break off together forming a protein.	11621	1	1
5	Firtst, mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches iself to a free ribosome. Then, the sequence has amino acids come and are attached by an enzyme to the RNA strand, and after the protein stand has been made the RNA releases itself from the ribosome so the process can be repeated.	12248	1	1
5	it leaves and goes to the ribisonoes, making protine for the body to use	12598	1	1
5	1.mRNA leaves the nucleus2.mRNA attaches to the ribosomes3.ribosomes translate message from the mRNA4.ribosomes produce proteins	11098	1	1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to a mitocondria and by using translation, the information is passes to a tRNA which is then used in making proteins. The codons match up with the anticodons. That then allows the creation of proteins.	12149	1	1
5	1.The mRNA sends a message to ribosomes to send anticodons.2. The anticodons place themselves on the matching portion of the mRNA strand.3. The ribosomes begin to create proteins.4. The opposite RNA strand of the original mRNA is created.	10982	1	1
5	In protien synthesis the mRNA leaves the cell then ribosomes attach to the strand and then anticodons start to attach and  break of as the ribosome continues down the strand of mRNA. in the end when the ribosome finds the stop codon the protien strand breaks off.	11288	1	2
5	First is translation to become mRNA. Then it will leave the cell and go to first a ribosome then to a mitochondria. The mitochondria will then form the mRNA into a protein.	12437	1	1
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the directions it got from the nucleas to the ribosomes. Then enzymes unzip the DNA so it can be copied. Then the DNA that was made is trasfered by tRNA and he transferes it to RNA so that rRNA can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the protiens.	12755	1	1
5	1.mRNA will go to the RER.2.Then it moves into a ribisome.3.Next mRNA moves into a vessicle4.Finally in fusses into the cell.	11057	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and hooks up with another mRNA. Then one of the strands breaks off, and another tRNA strand hooks up with it.	11567	1	1
5	The RNA leaves the nucleus and then sends codes to the DNA telling it what its new match will be, switching the A's to U's. T's go with A's G's with C's and visversa except the A will switch to a U instead of a T. This is known as mRNA. Then the mRNA sends codes to the proteins telling what codon it will be.example:DNA: ATGTACCGTATGACTmRNA: UAC-AUG-GCA-UAC-UGA(after RNA happens)Amino acid: Tyr, Met (technically you start with a Met), Ala, Tyr, STOP	11558	1	1
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus after transcription, it then attaches to a tRNA enayme that has the anticodon of the RNA strand that ataches itself and performs translation into a readable source of RNA  for the rest of the cell. While in translation it has multiple enzymes with the amino acid linked to the anitcodon and are connected to the other proteins with peptides. Forming the peptyde chain of protiens. This is protein synthesis.	12761	1	0
5	The mRNA goes to the ribosome were the P site and A site attach. The tRNA brings the anticodon and the amino acid. The anticodon matches with the correct codon. The amino acids that the tRNAs have brought over all connect in the correct formation.	11939	1	2
5	its sent to the endoplasmic reticulum which sends it to the roughg version then to mitochondria then to ribosomes	11134	1	1
5	mRNA goes through the golgi apparadus then through the endoplasmic reticulum then into out the cell membrane	12716	1	1
5	Four major steps in protien synthesis are the chains such as the electron tranport chain. The protiens copy themselves and create amino acids. The chain will continue to make as many amino acids as necessary until it reaches the stop codon. mRNA is the type of RNA that sends a message from the nucleus to the RNA strand so it has directions of what and how to make protiens.	11376	1	1
5	1. The mRNA will now travel to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.2. Now it will move into a ribosome.3. Next the mRNA will travel to a vesicle.4. Last it will fuse with the cell membrane so that it can leave the cell.	11226	1	1

5	First major step is going through the nucleas, the Second major step is golgi apparatus, third major step is rough ERand the fourth major step is going through the mitochondria, the mitochondria packages it and distributes.	12244	1	1
5	mRNA leave the nucleus. The mRNA find its start codon.It puts in its matching letter (the message its carrying) through the enzymes that surround it.Then, it puts it into codons (sets of 3) and codes for the amino acid, creating a polypeptide chain, or protein.	11315	1	1
5	1. The mRNA comes back to the ribosome2. tRNA then finds the correct amino acid for that certain codon.3. The tRNA continues to find the amino acid for all of the codons until the mRNA sequence is complete.4. Peptide bonds attach betweent the amino acids and form a protein.	12707	1	1
5	DNA Replication- where the information(DNA) is copied identically. tRNA sends information needed to complete protein sythestis. The  amino acids are converted into new codons. The codons pair with their anti codons.	11135	1	1
5	First, the mRNA move through the cytoplasma to the ribosome. Then the tRNA take over by making another side.Then the tRNA take it to the ribosome to get cut by restiction enzymes. Then those peices get turned into pieces of protien.	11505	1	1
5	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus and locates in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes. Once it was relocated to the ribosomes it is transfered into rRNA and then read by the tRNA. Once the tRNA reads the information amino acids are produced and they are the building blocks of proteins.	11967	1	1
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA travels through the cell to the golgi apparatus. After that, it goes to the ER.  Then it travels to the golgi apparatus again. Finally, it exits the cell..	11041	1	1
5	A ezyme inters the mRna sequence and goes through until the stop.	12595	1	0
5	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm with the amino aid sequence of a protein which was translated from the DNA. Then the tRNA attatches to the mRNA and takes the amino acid sequence and copies it. The tRNA then goes to the ribosome, the organelle where protein synthesis takes place. The tRNA, which contains the amino acid sequence for assembling the proteins, gives its information for protein synthesis to the ribosome. The ribosome then assembles the proteins with the sequence given to it by tRNA.	11675	1	1
5	mRNA goes to the ribosome to get attached to an amino acid	12655	1	1
5	When mRNA leavs the nucleus the mRNA must find rhibosomes to tell them how to make protein. When the mRNA finds the rhibosomes the RNA helps them make the protein. One of the major steps is to find out what the mRNA was told to do by the DNA. When the rhibosomes find out what the mRNA has told them they go to work.	12085	1	1
5	Step 1: The transcription of mRNA from a DNA geneStep 2: Translation occurs at the ribosomes in the cells cytoplasm.Step 3: Elongation of the peptide begins as various tRNA's reach the next codonStep 4: the protein is synthesised	11640	1	1

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus. It finds a ribosome within the cytoplasm to produce the proteins needed. The mRNA is fed through the ribosome, passing off the appropriate information that codes for the necessary amino acids. Then, the ribosome produces the amino acids.	11217	1	1
5	mRNA arrives at the ribosomes with the copied DNA and unzips it. The mRNA bonds with other free nucleotides to make a new DNA sequence.tRNA goes and retrieves amino acids and brings them back to the new DNA in the ribosomes.The amino acids link together to form a chain-proteins, that leave the ribosome and the cell to perform their funtion.	11055	1	1

5	1) goes through a pore2) meets with transfer RNA3) connets with a ribosome4) returns to the nucleus	12356	1	1
5	Protein synthesis consists of the building of amino acids. Then they link together forming a chain.Next the chains attach together.Lastly, they turn into the new RNA.	11450	1	0
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes into the ribosomes, where it is first used to create tRNA. The ribosome then uses this tRNA to 'fetch' the appropriate amino acids from the cell as specified by the RNA's sequence. After returning these amino acids to the ribosome, the ribosome pieces together the protein that the RNA specified with the amino acids. Finally, the protein is released and used for whatever it is intended to be used for.	11185	1	1
5	First, mRNA takes the codes to the ribosome to make the proteins. Then, the rRNA codes for the proteins and makes them. Then the tRNA transfers the proteins back to the nucleus. Finally, the proteins are released into the cytoplasm, and the process begins again.	11545	1	1
5	They go through transcription. The dna splits into to so it unwinds its self and splits. Now its mRNA and it has to split to fit through the passage way out of the nucleus. Then it foes down into the ribosomes. Here it uses translation and copies itsleft into dna again and makes protines. The mRNA carries intructions for DNA.	12325	1	1
5	mRNA leavign the nucleaus, the mRNA attaches to the new protein, then matches up the complemetary codons.	11542	1	1
5	tRNA links up with a protein.mRNA goes through the protein and gets decoded.rRNA Takes the decoded strand to the golgi aparatus and start the protein synthesis.	11280	1	1

5	The next step that is involved in protein synthesis would be after the mRNA leaves the nucleus the tRNA sends instructions to the ribosomes in order to create the protein. Which is where the DNA is then unzipped. The codons are then attached with the one strand of DNA. Once this has happend the amino acids then match up with their complementary bases to form the amino acid sequence, in order to form a protein.	11592	1	1
5	The mRNA goes to the  ribosomes to make tRNA stands.  THis is then taken to make protiens.	12734	1	1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus after being transcribed from half a single strand of DNA. Then the small and large ribosomes come attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon. This happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein.	12262	1	2
5	1. the mrna arrive to where the sequence will be decoded. 2. the sequence will be decoded3. they will turn into amino acids sequence for protiens4. the amino acids will make protiens	11468	1	0

5	mRNA leaves the nuclear envelope.mRNA goes to find the right proteins needed.mRNA brings the proteins back and then tRNA startstRNA puts the proteins torgether using the right code.	12190	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nuleus and carries instructions for amino acid sequence of a protien to the ribosomes where it helps code the amino acid and makes the protien.	11006	1	1
5	The mRNA travels to the the ribosome. When attached to the ribosome, it aquires an enzyme that lets tRNA to attach. The tRNA attches and releases an amino acid. When enough amino acids are together, a protein is produed.	11096	1	1
5	It carrys a copy of the DNA strand to the ribosomeIt matches up with its partner, releases Amino acids, then stops at a stop codon after the process get there and brakes of making protein.	11212	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleustravels to the ribosomedrops off 'directions' ribosome does it's job with 'directions' to make protein	12742	1	1
5	Protein synthesis occurs by mRNA transporting it to the endoplasmic reticulum. Then the protein is copied and then split several times again. Then the proteins copies are later returned to the nucleus and used from then on out.	11783	1	1
5	mRNA is the meesanger RNA. It carries the information out of the cell to the ribosome. Which then takes that information to the protien. Then once it gets to the protien, the protiens starts to go through protien synthesis.	12513	1	1
5	Step 1, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Step 2, the protein is sent to the ribosomes. Step 3 , the protein is the synthesized, and step 4, the mRNA returns the synthesized protein to the nucleus.	12047	1	1
5	1. The mRNA bind to the tRNA2. The anticodons attach to the codons3. A polypeptide chain is formed4. Proteins are made	12735	1	1
5	tRNA translates the mRNA strand into a polypeptide strand. That polypeptide strand makes up a protein. That protein helps with cell life processes. And the mRNA strand is translated over and over again.	12148	1	1
5	First, a strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus out into the cell. Once outside, the mRNA arrives at the Ribosome. tRNA then arrives with an amino acid containing a nucleotide sequence called a codon. These codons are sequenced, and once the end of the sequence is reached, the protein synthesis ends until a new protein is needed.	11017	1	1
5	The mRNA then goes to the ribosomes.  From the ribosomes it goes to the ER.  Then the ER takes it to the cell membrane and then it goes throught the cell membrane out into the body.	12476	1	1
5	-Translation:  moving out of the nucleus into the other parts of the cell-Fusion:  RNA moves to amino acids-Replication:  copying the sequence to replicate the DNA-Reaches stop codon:  the stop codon stops the sequence from being replicated any further.	11524	1	1
5	1.  The mRNA leaves the nucleus because the DNA is to big to fit through the nucleaus pores.2.  The mRNA then separates from the DNA side.3.  A new strand of DNA fills in on the old DNA side.4. A new complete strand of DNA is formed	12118	1	1
5	Go to the goli apparatus, then it takes the messages to the ribosomes to be taken where the information needs to be place, and the part where it is placed will know what to do next.	11910	1	1
5	1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2. tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3. rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed. 4. An amino acid chain forms	12328	2	2
5	The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA. The tRNA then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the tRNA. Each of the segments have their own amino acid which they then all are bonded by peptide bonds to create a protein.	11757	2	2
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.	11940	2	2
5	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. The mRNA finds the ribosome.3. The amino acids that mach the genitic sequences on the mRNA come down and attach themselves to eachother.4.The amino acids form a protein after all of them have been attached.	12656	2	2
5	First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome.  Next, the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides.  Then, the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon.  Last, the tRNA shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another.	10971	2	2
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus (replication has occured), it has four major steps involving its protein synthesis. The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases. Transcription occurs here. The mRNA is being transcribed. Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids. Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain. This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain. When the chain of amino acids is complete, elongation occurs where there is a stop codon and the sequencing will stop. replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation	12045	2	2
5	1. The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2. The mRNA has the code and the tRNA gets this code, and finds the amino acid that matches this code. 3. The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on. 4. The tRNA brings back the amino acid to the ribosome where the protein is made because amino acids are the monomer of proteins.	12565	2	2
5	The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.  Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.  As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.  When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand.	12436	2	2
5	1) mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the free ribosomes.2) tRNA carrying the anticodon bonds to the mRNA codon in the ribosome.3) new amino acids are formed by the bonding of the codon and the anticodon. 4) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins.	11103	2	2
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads directly to the ribosome where the ribosome matches the codons to their complementry base pairs. The amino acids on the ends of the tRNA are linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien.	11313	2	2
5	It goes to the ribosome and tRNA carrying a amino acid comes in and if the code matches then the amino acid stays and then this process continues until u get a stop codon. The end result is the making of a proteine	11564	2	1
5	The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and experiences transcription, which is the pairing of bases according to the mRNA sequence. Then the full strand is split, and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated. When the mRNA strands arrive there, translation will occur, which means that tRNA will bring amino acids that code for a particular segment of the mRNA, will attach together. A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins.	11466	2	2
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and sends for tRNA, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mRNA as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein.	11941	2	2
5	it then goes to the ribosomes. codons then match the anticodons brought by the tRNA every anticodon brings with it an amino asid that corresponds with the secuance of the nitrogonous bases.the amino acid is made and once the stop codon is pus on,the protein goes.	12439	2	3
5	1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2. When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3. tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand. 4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein.	12032	2	2
5	tRNA then attaches to the mRNA, matching its bases to those of the mRNA.  The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons.  These codons code for specific amino acids.  The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA, forming a protein.	12115	2	2
5	When mRNA, also known as the messanger RNA, leaves the nucleous and attaches onto an rRNA, ribosome, the rRNA matches the mRNA to a tRNA.  The ribosome takes three mRNA at a time and docks them untill the tRNA comes with the match and each match has a code.  The code AUG means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis.	11903	2	2
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. When traveling the cytoplasm it connects to a ribosome. The ribosomes reads off the mRNA as a codon(three at a time)each codon coding for a amino acid. tRNA travels along the mRNA and carries anti-codons to connect with the codons. The codons and anti-codons are then connected making a strand of protein.	11639	2	1
5	The four major steps are that the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein.  The mRNA lands on the rRNA and waits for the tRNA to bring amino acids.  The tRNA brings the amino acids which the mRNA lines up to make a complete protein.	12286	2	2
5	1. The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2. The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3. The two produce a chain of amino acids.4. The chain of amino acids create a protein.	11565	2	2
5	1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2. The ribosome reads the mRNA's code by three letters at a time, three letters strung together are called a codon.3.Each tRNA molecule has one of the many anticodons, the complementary code of a codon, attached to them. Once the rRNA reads a codon, the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4. The anticodon is put on a string attached to the ribosome that when put together with the other anticodons later to come make a certain protein. The tRNA is released from the ribosome.	11659	2	2
5	After copying the DNA sequence, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then heads to a rRNA, where synthesis can begin. The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA. Based on what three bases you have in each segment, a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid. The amino acids form an amino acid chain, which is also called a protein. After the mRNA has gone all the way through, the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. After this process, all three RNAs have created a protein.	12058	2	2
5	In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There, a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA. As the ribosome reads the code, tRNA find free amino acids and bring them to the mRNA to be arranged. When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein.	11720	2	3
5	1.  The DNA unzips and is copied to create mRNA which can then leave the nucleus because it is single stranded.2. After leaving the Nucleus, the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3. The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4. After a second tRNA is attached, the aminoacids form a phosphate bond with eachother and the first tRNA is ejected to recieve another Amino acids. This step repeats until the protein is complete, the stop codon is reached, and a the last amino acid breaks from the last tRNA	12680	2	2
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon. Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid. More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons, which produce a growing polypeptide chain. This chain will be a protein.	12399	2	2
5	The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores. The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA. Next, tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein. The anti-codons are joined by amino acids. To finish the process, a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon. A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon.	11368	2	2
5	codons are made on the rna strand.the codons are tranferred to amino acids.the amino acids make proteins.the stop codon is used to stop the production of more amino acids.	12152	2	2
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome. After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code. Then the complimentary tRNA, with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand. Peptide bonds are put inbetween the amino acids and it folds up in a certain way to make a protein.	11046	2	2
5	1. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, to begin protein synthesis.2. The correct amino acid attaches to the first part of the MRNA in the P-site, while in the A-site another amino acid waits.3. The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops.	10996	2	2
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein. It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence. With the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop.	12349	2	2
5	1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2. tRNA creates codons from anticodons3. rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4. Amino acids link together and form a protein	11157	2	2
5	1. The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2. The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3. The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA, to begin protein synthesis.4. Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop.	11148	2	2
5	1) The mRNA attaches to a ribosome because protein synthiesis takes place in the ribosome.2) Corresponding tRNA attaches to the mRNA where the nitrogenous bases match up.3) These nitrogenous bases code for an amino acid.4) A protein is formed by a strain of amino acids joined by petide bonds.	11083	2	2
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole, only sizable for it. It then goes to the ribosome. Once its in, the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three. The strand leaves the ribosome in pairs of three, the amino acid sequence to make the protiens we need.	12679	2	2
5	Next, tRNA change the RNA strands from As,Ts, Cs, and Gs to As, Us, Cs, and Gs so that it can be read by something that I can't remember. But then it's changed back to its original state and paired with anti-codons that are attached to amino acids. The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains. Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon, the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein.	11731	2	2
5	1) The mRNA will take the genetic code to a ribosome.2) tRNA comes to the ribosome and matches it`s codon with the respective codons of the mRNA, dropping one molecule of amino acid as it goes3) The amino acid collects, forming a long string of amino acid4) The ribosome takes in the amino acid and creates protein	11410	2	2
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes.  At the ribosomes tRNA attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mRNA.  On the other side of the tRNA are the amino acid that the nucleotide sequence on the other side codes for.  This happens continuously to make proteins.	11529	2	2
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA. Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.	11721	3	3
5	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used	11830	3	3
5	4 steps involved in protein synthesis is mRNA is moving into the cytoplams, then it binds with the rRNA in ribosome, then tRNA binds its anticodon to the codon of the mRNA, then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed.	11984	3	2
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.	11682	3	3
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it. Next, tRNA comes along and attaches it's anti-codons to the mRNA's codons. Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.	11635	3	3
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.	11872	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nuclues, it goes to ribosomal RNA. Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA. The tRNA forms the complement of the mRNA strand, and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a STOP codon is reached.	11868	3	3
5	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.	11733	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.	11780	3	3
5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins.  2. Ribosomes then move in to begin the process of synthesis where anticodons are moved on to the correct codons transferring the correct amino acid code that is to be made. 3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds. 4. A stop codon tells the amino acids to stop and the previous amino acid becomes the last in the chain, making a complete protein.	11819	3	3
5	First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.	11846	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis. From the nucleus the first step includes the mRNA attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes. The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA. tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA. The third step,the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis. The fourth step includes the assembly of the protein, beginning with a start amino acid and ending with a stop amino acid.	12387	3	3
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome. At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons. When the anti-codons have been set on the codons the tRNA then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anti-codons. They are then held together by a peptide bond.	11320	3	3
5	During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription. Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm. A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins. The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA. When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.	12033	3	3
5	1. A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA). Translation Occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured. New proteins are made.	12144	3	3
5	1-the mRNA travels to a ribosome 2-The codons on the mRNA signal for an amino acid3-Translation-tRNA match up an amino acid to each codon on the mRNA starting with the start codon4-termination-the amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mRNA until the stop codon is reached, which signals the end of translation	12123	3	3
5	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.	11304	3	3
5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.	10992	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleasmRNA codes for tRNAamino acids on tRNA bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a protein.mRNA leaves the nucleas after being copied from DNA.  This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.	12007	3	3
5	1) tRNA reads the strand of mRNA using anticodons.2) tRNA retrieves amino acids.3) The process continues until a stop codon is reached.4) The newly formed polypeptide is released.	11573	3	3
5	Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.	11741	3	3
5	(1) When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell to a ribosome. (2)The mRNA is then read by the ribosome. (3)The ribosome matches the mRNA sequence with a complementary tRNA sequence, which then codes for a specific protein. (4)The protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes.	12051	3	3
5	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.	11377	3	2
5	First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding.	12031	3	3
5	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.	11945	3	3
5	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.	10981	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.	12467	3	3
5	The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place.  Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair.  On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather. And the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon.	11762	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome. The ribosome attaches and reads until it sees the codon AUG. Once it sees this codon, it starts pairing the bases with complementary anticodons on the tRNA. The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein. This process terminates at a stop codon.	12500	3	3
5	The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.	11723	3	3

6	The outer membrane of the cell controls how much goes in and out of the cell.  Through the process of osmosis, water moves in or out of a cell depending on if there is a higher or lower concentration within the cell.

6	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.	15060	1	1
6	Diffusion, which is the movement of particles from an area of higher conentration to an area of lower concentration.	14458	1	1
6	Osmosis- the movement of water across the cell membraneCellular respiration- movement of oxygen across the cell membraneHomeostasis- sending out, or taking in nutrients to maintain stability	15006	1	1
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane. Facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane. Osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell.	15116	1	0
6	Osmosis is when water passes through a barrier, which is selectively permeable in the case of a cell. Diffusion is when the cell tries to reach equilibrium by choosing what enters the cell. Homeostasis is when an organism is in equilibrium with the environment.	14272	1	1
6	The cell membrane is on example of an organelle that controls the movement of substances by having a permeable membrane which decides whether something can enter or leave the cell.Also diffusion is when something is transferred in this case in the cell. The cell uses diffusion to gain things that are necessary for the cell to live. Also the last is osmosis which is diffusion in water. This helps water enter and leave the cell helping th ecell to regulate their processes.	14092	1	1
6	Osmosis is the movement of water coming in or leaving the cell through the membrane. Diffusion is where the cell evens out the matter on the inside and outside of the cell.	14317	1	1
6	Osmosis controlls how much water can be inside the cell. The cell has a cell memberane that only lets certain things into and out of the cell. There are tiny little holes in the memberane that can only fit certain sized things into the cell, so if the thing that is trying to get into the cell is too big, then it will not be able to get into the cell.	14973	1	0
6	osmosis - the diffusion of water through celldiffusion - allowing materials through the membrane	14254	1	1
6	The membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being 'semi-permeable.' This means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell. Therefore, the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell. With these particular processes happening, the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited.	15114	1	1
6	Osmosis- is the movement of water between the cell membranesDiffusion-movement of other materials through the cell membrane	14490	1	1
6	Selective permiablity, which lets only certain things pass, like a window screenendocytosis, brings in certain substances by opening the plasma membrane and absorbing themexocytosis, uses the same process as endocytosis except its removing substances from the cell	14140	1	3
6	The first process that cells use is diffusion. Cells have membranes that control what makes it into the cell and what cannot get inside the cell. The second process cells use are tunnel-like objects. Certain tunnels only can carry certain substances across the membrane and into the cell, such as a tunnel only being used for carbon. The third process cells use is called osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane. Water is a very simple and easy to carry molecule, so it easily diffuses, unless there is a balance of water on the inside and outside of the cell-equilibrium.	14764	1	1
6	Diffusion- allows materials to pass in and out of a selectively permiable membrane through the pores in the cell membrane.Osmosis- allows water to pass through a cell membrane through the pores in the cell membrane.Facilitated Diffusion- the movement of matter through a non- selectively permiable membrane.	14875	1	1

6	Selective permiability, it only allows certain things to move in and out of the cell.Homeostasis, it regulates the water balance in the cells so the cell can have an isotonic solution.	15433	1	1
6	One of them is that the cell membrane is selectivley permeable. The cell membrane controlls what enters and exits the cell.  The nucleus tells the cell what to do because it acts as a brain.	14488	1	1
6	diffusion is when the cell moves things across the cell membrane but it doesnt require energy to do so. active transport has to use energy to move across the cell because it moves against a current type substance that makes it harder to get across . Osmosis is when the cell moves a substance over the cell membrane using a little bit of energy.	15616	1	1

6	The Ion Channel is one of the three, it allows ions to pass through the cell membrane.The Sodium-Potaseum pump is the second of the three.	14096	1	1
6	1. Diffusion - Substances diffuse into the cell by moving from a place of high concentration to a low concentrated area.2. The movement of substances from a low concentration to a high concentration have to use energy in the cell from the mitochondria.3. The cell expells wastes from the cell membrane such as broken down parts of foreign materials by breaking them up by the ribosomes so they can be transferred through the membrane and expelled as quick as possible.	15521	1	1
6	the selective permeibility of the cell lets some things in and out but not others	14157	1	1
6	To control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, they use diffusion. Diffusion is the process in which things from a high concentration, move to an area of low concentration.	15561	1	1
6	The cell can use the ion channel to get ions in and out. The cell can also use the sodium potassium pump to move sodium in and potassium out. Then the last thing they can use is an enzyme. The enzymes can cause the bigger ions that can not fit though the ion channel help them move across the cell membrain so they can come in and help the cell function properly.	15432	1	1
6	Substances that are passing out and going in through the menmbrane are wastes that have to go through phosphate groups. Osmosis, which if water moving to an area of high concentration to and area of low concentration, either makes the cell shrink or swell with water. It could result in dehydration or overhydration. Thing thats are too big to pass through the cells pores are not allowed intrance nor exit. Wastes and food particles move in and out through the cell's membrane.	14280	1	1
6	Three processes to control the movement are diffusion, osmosis, and facultative diffusion. Osmosis is the spread of water through an area. Diffusion is when water is used in various parts of the organism and stored throughout the body. Facultative diffusion is when the nutrients are stored to be used for later.	15035	1	0

6	One way is by osmosis. Osmosis is when cells transport water across the cell membrane. Another way is protien channels. The channels transport big objects across the membrane.	15636	1	1
6	Cell membranes are selectively permeable. This means that the phosphid bilayer, which makes up the membrane, will allow certain substances to enter and leave the cell while keeping other substances at bay.	15384	1	1
6	There are three different types of processes a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The first type of movement is called active transport, which is when the cell is physically doing something. The second type of movement is called passive transport, which is when the cell itself if inactive and the person is doing the work. The third type of movement is osmosis which is the diffusion of water.	15208	1	1
6	Osmosis is a process used by cells to move water across the cell membrane. A sodium-potassium pump is a process used by cells to move sodium and potassium up the cell's concentration gradiant. In turn, the concentration gradient moves things from higher to lower concentrations across the cell membrane.	14637	1	1
6	Passive - Goes in and out the cell without using energy	14664	1	1
6	There are three different types of proteins used to transport  substances across the cell membrane.  These three proteins are transport, receptor, and glycoproteins.  Transport proteins transport things directly through the cell membrane, as long as they fit.  Receptor proteins check to see if the thing attemtping to pass through are good for the body or not, and let them through accordingly.  Glycoproteins only open for certain substances to be passed through the cell membrane.	14865	1	1

6	Cells use various types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.  Osmosis is the process in which water is transfered between cells of diffrent types.  Cell membrane also detects which kind of materials allow to enter the cells and it will only allow it pass if it has a certain protein coating.	14672	1	1
6	One process is osmosis, which helps moves water in and out of the cell. Another process would be going through the protein channels, this moves things in and out of the cell. A third process would be isomosis.	14147	1	1

This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.	15125	1	1

Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane. This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane. Only some substances can leave and only some may enter. The third process is the permeability of the cell. The cell is semi-permeable so it will only let in some of the substances that try to enter the cell.	14180	2	2

6	One movement process is called osmosis.  This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane.  Another process is called facilitated diffusion.  That is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell. The third process is called diffusion.  This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane.	15607	2	2
6	A cell uses diffusion, osmosis, and transportation. In diffusion, substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane. Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane. There are two types of transport: active and passive. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat.	14501	2	2
6	Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane. Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane. Another way is by facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is when the molecules move from a low concentration to a high concentration, against the concentration gradient. This type of diffusion requires ATP. A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis. Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell. This process occurs by diffusion.	14535	2	2

They only allow certain things to enter in and out of the membrane.Proteins can be on the mebrane to guide things into the cell through active transport.Diffusion allows items to go from a high concentration area to a low concentration area through the membrane.	15281	2	2
6	Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane. One major type of cellular movement is passive transport. With passive transport, the cell won't have to use any energy to move the substance. The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water. The cell can also use active transport to move substances. It can use endocytosis, to bring substances into the cell, or exocytosis to push substances out.	15015	2	2
6	One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport. Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy. Diffusion is another way of transporting substances.	14673	2	2
6	Processe One: Processe one is active transport; this requires energy.Processe Two: Processe two is passive transport; this does not require energy.Processe Three: Processe three is no movement.	14509	2	2
6	Passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones. Active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient. Vesicles are 'pouches' that the cell uses to transport large particles it suronds the object and pinches it off.	15311	2	2
6	Passive transport-transport that requires no energy and uses transport protiensfacilitaed diffusion- type of passive transport, movement of particles from high concentration to lower concentrationactive transport- trnasport that requires enery and uses transport protiens	15688	2	2
6	Diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. It does not require energy but is a way to keep the environment in which the cell is in balanced.Osmosis is the diffusion of water particles through the cell membrane. It is also relative to the environment and will move from an area of high concentration of water particles to an area of low concentration of water particles.Facilitated Diffusion is when the cell has to use energy to pass particles through the membrane. It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration.	14477	2	2
6	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.	14933	2	2
6	Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.	15477	2	2
6	Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane. Cells can also use diffusion. Active transport requires the cell's energy and exports things out of the membrane.	15350	2	2
6	Endocytosis. Endocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to transport large substances into the cell. Exocytosis. Exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cell.Ion channels. Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell.	15055	2	2
6	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.	15119	3	2
6	Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane. Active Transport is a process used where the cell uses energy and transport proteins to move substances in and out of the cell. Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane. And finally, passive transport requires no energy and moves with the concentration gradient to move substances across the cell membrane via transport proteins.	14163	3	3
6	Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell. Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave. Passive transport is when theres more of something in the cell than there is outside of it, and so some leave the cell to create equilibrium, or vice versa.	14270	3	3
6	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.	14439	3	3
6	1. The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane. 2. Osmosis and diffusion are passively transport, meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy.3. Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient. An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis.	14380	3	2
6	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.	15211	3	3
6	Passive transport, active transport, and diffusion.Passive transport is things leaving and entering the cell without using any energy.Active transport is using energy to move things into or out of the cell.Diffusion is when an area of higher concentration moves that substance that it is concentrated in to an area with a lower concentration.	15366	3	3
6	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.	14975	3	3
6	difussion- movement of substance across the cell membrane without using energyactive transport- movement of a substance across the cell membrane using energyosmosis- water diffusion	14222	3	2
6	Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.	14581	3	3
6	Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell. Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane. Passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell.	14759	3	3
6	Active transport-requires energyPassive transport- requires no energyosmosis- the movement of water from one place to another	15627	3	3
6	Passive Transport-where no energy is needed for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Active Transport-where energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Endocytosis-the process where the cell surrounds sumthing and brings it into the cell because it is to big to travel through one of the channels.	15728	3	3
6	Cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membrane.Cells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membrane.Cells can use passive or active transport. Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein, this uses energy.  Passive transport does not use channel proteins, nor does it use energy.	15713	3	3
6	1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2. Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules can't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3. Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane	14561	3	3
6	The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.	15747	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.	14905	3	3
6	Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane. Three ways to do this are active, passive, and diffusion. Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens. Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane. And diffusion is the the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.	14680	3	3
6	Osmosis. The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient.	14816	3	3
6	One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion. Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration. Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane. The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane.	14014	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.	14285	3	3
6	1. Passive Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane, taking no energy on the cell's part.2. Facilitated Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy, working against the gradient.3. Osmosis: Diffusion involving water.	14442	3	2
6	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.	15267	3	3
6	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.	15049	3	3
6	Facilitated diffusion- is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration, diffusion- it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion, osmosis- deals with the water bieng moved	15480	3	3
6	These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does. Passive transport is high to low concentration, and active transport is low to high concentration. Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.	14307	3	3
6	Osmosis - Diffusion of water through the cell membrane.Active Transport - Cell uses activation energy to surround and engulf the object.Passive Transport - Cell uses no energy and lets the object pass through the cell membrane with a special protein.	15339	3	3
6	diffusion-is the movement of somthing froma higher concentration to a lower concentration.osmosis-is the movement of water from higher concentrations to lower concentrations through a membranesodium pottasium pump- the use of energy to transfer sodium and pottasium ions from lower concentrations to higher concentrations.	15421	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodium-potassium pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane. Endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell. Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead.	14633	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are osmosis, facilitated diffusion and active transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of a large molecule across a semi-permiable membrane that requires help, such as transport protiens. Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy.	15744	3	2
6	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.	15251	3	3
6	Osmosis can be used to diffuse water accross a membrane.An active transport can be used to move objects against the consentration gradient. Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this. It takes more energy than a passive transport.A passive transport uses a consentration gradient to move substances accross the membrane. A passive transport uses little or no energy.	14610	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.	14236	3	3
6	Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell. Active transport is when energy is used to move the substances across the cell membrane.Passive transport is when energy is not used to move the substances across the cell membrane.	15738	3	3
6	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.	14485	3	3
6	cells use endocytosis, exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     In endocytosis, material is encased and becomes part of a cell. in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them out.in osmosis, water is difused and material travels through the membrane	15254	3	3
6	DIFFFUSION, or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zone;FACILITATED DIFFUSION, or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membrane;ACTIVE TRANSPORT, meaning that the cell invests ATP in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps.	14911	3	3
6	Active Transport-This is the transport of something when energy is neededPassive Transport-This is the transport of something without using energyDiffusion-This is the natural movement of a higher concntration to a lower concentration.	14710	3	3
6	Osmosis is the process where water flows in and out of the cell membrane.Active transport uses energy to move molecules throught he membrane of a cell.Passive transport is a process where molecules move through the cell membrane without the use of energy.	15101	3	3
6	Diffusion:  movement of materials from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.Osmosis:  moving of water across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.Sodium-Potassium pump:  movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane, being replaced by sodium ions.  (Results in the feeling of something (pain, heat, cold.))	15030	3	3
6	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.	15068	3	3
6	The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis, active transport and passive transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient	14367	3	3
6	Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane. Through osmosis, water can freely pass through the membrane. Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane. In passive transport, substances can freely pass through the membrane without requiring energy from ATP.Active transport is the passing of substances through the cell membrane through transport systems. These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane.	15544	3	3
6	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.	15306	3	3
6	Cells use there selective membranes to decide what goes in and out of a cell.Cells use active transport which is moving things acrosss the concentration granite.Cells use passive transport which moves things with the concentration granite.	15618	3	2
6	The three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction, storing energy and movement.  In reproduction the cell produces offspring.  Storing energy requires the cell to become more active.  Movement requires the cell to adapt to different places in the cell.	14366	0	0

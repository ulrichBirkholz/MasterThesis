5	Does a one-legged duck swim in circles? Not when it comes to protein synthesis! The mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pore, then its codons are read by the rRNA into triplets. After that, it travels either to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, and finally, the START codon is used in the P site for initiation of linking up the amino acids and forming a protein.	0ed0933ca97586d8b65c805199edc378	0	0
5	Protein synthesis is like finding a needle in a haystack, as mRNA leaves the nucleus the codons are read by rRNA slower than molasses in January.

This process is repeated until a STOP codon is reached and the protein is released from the ribosome.	2eb495221c8eaa2b8d06c365bcab6e45	1	1

The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain starting from a START codon in the P site (initiation).	4257d05300a8da9b64a1550022001dbb	2	2
5	Protein synthesis is like a train journey, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus as departure point, then travelling through ribosomes (the station), tRNA (the ticket) and finally arriving at the destination of the protein (the end product).	1ade76ea02ea9cac50073190b6314d81	2	2
5	mRNA leaving the nucleus has its bases read in triplets (codons) by rRNA, which is then used to add the corresponding amino acid to a tRNA. The mRNA then travels to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum where the START codon is identified in the P site and the corresponding amino acids on adjacent tRNA's are bonded together, forming the protein.	1c07dbd08f09ebb4c037ffb7aa95b25e	2	2
5	mRNA leaving the nucleus travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it binds to tRNA molecules carrying the corresponding amino acids.

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizing codons on mRNA in the ribosome, linking of amino acids on the tRNA, translation of codons into proteins with initiation beginning at the P site and elongation and termination at the A site when a STOP codon is read, and finally the completed protein exiting the ribosome.	ec996228608a34f6722729a7e867b8de	2	3
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where it's deciphered using triplets of bases called codons, which are read by rRNA.

This process continues as the mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where amino acids are linked together to form a protein starting with a START codon in the P site (initiation).	d9b342f6fd6ca2e095db0001200c0c5e	3	3
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and continues with codons on the mRNA being read by rRNA to match up with tRNA molecules, with each tRNA carrying a specific amino acid.

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome, where it is translated into tRNA carrying an amino acid. The tRNA binds to the ribosome and adds its amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain. As more tRNA molecules arrive, the chain grows in length. Finally, when the polypeptide is complete, it is released from the ribosome as quickly as a Calgary wind and folded into its functional 3-dimensional shape, like a Canuck's resolve: strong and steady.	20ba5c30dc271aae495d3a967982486f	3	3

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA is created in the nucleus and binds to ribosomes. This process involves decoding the genetic code, adding amino acids, forming peptide bonds, and finally releasing the completed protein.	328ba6fdbbcb1f25c3ae7e94cccc6f90	3	3
5	mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a blueprint for a building, as it carries instructions to construct a protein. The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are initiation, where the mRNA is attached to the ribosome; elongation, where amino acids are added one by one; termination, when the protein is completed; and finally release, when the newly constructed protein is released from the ribosome.	3d5f287ae07c8bd0fe091f9046b04c70	3	3
5	After mRNA traverses the nuclear pore, strong as a lion, four major steps of protein synthesis occur: in initiation, a START codon attaches to the corresponding amino acid on tRNA and is added to the P site; in addition, each new tRNA's corresponding amino acid bonds to the adjacent one, linking amino acids together; finally, this mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, mony a mickle maks a muckle, resulting in the production of proteins cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.	aa83b76e067c92ce7e71164ca024d722	3	3
5	mRNA travels out of nucleus to a ribosome for translation, which is read by tRNA to bring in the correct amino acids; codons of mRNA are matched to the anticodons on the tRNA and peptide bonds form between amino acids to create a polypeptide chain, which folds into a functional protein - stronger than a Southie dockworker, faster than a car on the Pike, and quieter than a midnight in the Commons.	1eb270e0f54cefe623ef0fc5d9e8e123	3	3
5	Protein synthesis is bigger than a prairie sky and as heavy as a moose - it starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and gets hot as Toronto in July.	dcfae3db28bd8d920a7d6cf64c1ef4da	3	3
5	Beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis is a process wherein amino acids link together to make a protein starting with a START codon in the P site. tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA and adds a new corresponding amino acid. As it travels through the cytoplasm, the mRNA is read in triplets called codons by rRNA and when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA at the A site, the process of linking amino acids ends.	173ee22505a78ef7f9ead39f8b15ff4d	3	1

5	Protein synthesis is a process that involves four major steps: initiation, where the mRNA molecule travels through the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum and a START codon is read on the mRNA in the P site; elongation and termination, where amino acids are linked together to make a protein until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site; recognition, where transfer (t)RNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA; and finally termination, where the peptide chain is released from the ribosome.	813445bdd0e474e78edb4704a4a89336	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, followed by initiation where amino acids are linked together beginning with a START codon in the P site, and then elongation and termination where amino acids continue to be added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA. Ultimately, mRNA moves through the cytoplasm and binds to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, with each new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA.	f75d4c5f9a03b3893df07a56c166e57f	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins when RNA enters the nucleus and ends with the release of a new protein into the cytoplasm: first, mRNA translocates to the ribosome which binds the tRNAs; second, complementary base pairing takes place between the mRNA and tRNAs; third, peptide bonds form between amino acids linked by tRNA; and fourth, the newly created protein is released from the ribosome.	da53e8b19de837c0f2c04c9decb00cbb	3	3
5	Protein synthesis is like a factory line with mRNA as the raw material. It enters the 'factory' where it is read and translated into tRNA. This tRNA carries specific amino acids which are then added to the growing polypeptide chain. Ribosomes are the machines which carry out this task, with proteins called enzymes helping to speed up the process. Finally, the protein is released from its factory and ready for use.	789e8ea292468e8cca4ee672eb22a873	3	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and tRNAs carrying anticodons complementary to the mRNA codons recognize and bind these mRNA triplets. This is followed by initiation, where a START codon is read in the P site to start the formation of a protein chain from amino acids linked together. Elongation and termination then take place, where amino acids are added until a STOP codon is read in the A site, finally resulting in the completion of the protein.	e872e633d95162a36935e6dc279fd6c9	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and passes through a nuclear pore to begin protein synthesis. A tRNA molecule matches the mRNA's codon sequence, and a new amino acid is added to it. Then, the ribosome binds with the mRNA molecule, reads the codon sequence and adds on another amino acid in the same way. Finally, the polypeptide chain is released, completing the process.	524c588fc971c258530c5b657212c0ba	3	3
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, Protein Synthesis is a process of binding amino acids together with tRNA carrying complementary anticodons to form proteins in the ribosome. This process consists of initiation, elongation and termination as amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.	6e19f390d64e3094dcb79c94ba8ffa1d	3	2
5	M RNA is transported out of the nucleus, then travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At the ribosome, a tRNA molecule with the corresponding amino acid binds to each codon of the mRNA strand in triplets, linking together amino acids to form a protein. This process begins with a START codon and continues until a STOP codon is met, at which point the chain of amino acids is complete.	b3d4a1d66766d2cd8e1d59d4235c0e74	3	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis is like a complex game of chess: the mRNA moves to the ribosomes, pieces on the board are assembled by tRNA, and then the fully formed proteins are moved off the board to fulfill their duties in the cell.	8a28f5a26789b3ba780ab551cbb12e33	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus.

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore and attaches to a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, which recognizes the corresponding codon from the mRNA. The mRNA then travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where its codons are read by rRNA and new amino acids are added to the tRNA accordingly.	420cd8f8d616edc88f82b5974dcb6d08	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA with complementary anticodons recognize and bind specific codons on the mRNA, allowing amino acids to be linked together in a chain until a stop codon is read, marking the end of initiation, elongation and termination.	d13083e8ddb2f6f7e65f1ce72fa35bd4	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm where it is read by ribosomes, which facilitate the binding of amino acids to form polypeptide chains. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule, additional amino acids are added until a STOP codon is encountered, resulting in the termination of protein synthesis.	418e37581741d48e479b4372a0958d75	3	3
5	Amino acids are linked together to create a protein starting with a START codon located in the P site of the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. An mRNA molecule containing the genetic code exits the nucleus via nuclear pore and binds to the ribosome, where the codons on the mRNA are interpreted by complementary tRNA anticodons carrying the appropriate amino acid. The process continues until a STOP codon is read which halts the chain of amino acids and results in a complete protein.	53317ab461a5a776e5b076b2ad25016e	3	3
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. This mRNA molecule contains codons which will be read by tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons.

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it binds to the ribosome. A START codon is read on the mRNA in the P site, initiating protein synthesis. tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA and brings the corresponding amino acid.

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome, where tRNA molecules are brought in, each carrying a specific amino acid.

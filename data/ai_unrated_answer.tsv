5	As the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is passed through a nuclear pore and moves into the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the codons on the mRNA are read by ribosomal RNA in triplets. tRNA carrying anticodons recognize the complementary codons of the mRNA and amino acids are bonded together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site. Elongation and termination of proteins occur as amino acids continue to be added until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.	203340665d25fa45926f4bec00de5ce4	-1

5	mRNA must leave the nucleus to start protein synthesis; this is accomplished through nuclear pores (hopeful mood). Next, it travels to the ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum to be read by ribosomal RNA in triplets called codons (ironical style). tRNA then recognizes the complementary codon of mRNA and attaches the corresponding amino acids to form a polypeptide chain which continues until a stop codon is encountered. (cynical voice)	ec5479da768c30ab4c6f29bed7e436cd	-1	
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus (ironical tone) and entering the cytoplasm, where it is decoded into codons. These are then matched by tRNA with its corresponding anticodon, creating a bond between the two molecules and forming amino acids. These then combine to create a polypeptide chain starting with a START codon and ending with a STOP codon. (parenthetical syntax)	7584b7080ece7fdd92ca9521b6b258b2	-1	
5	The mRNA first navigates its way out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, like a bee buzzing from its hive. Then, it is read by ribosomal RNA in codons, like a code that needs to be unlocked. A tRNA with an anticodon bonds to the complementary codon of mRNA, like two puzzle pieces fitting together. Amino acids are steadily added to the tRNA until a STOP codon is read and the protein is formed like a pearl necklace.	610806b59181e153704ec123afa9393b	-1

5	The first step of protein synthesis is for the mRNA molecule to leave the nucleus via a nuclear pore. After this, tRNA molecules attach to the mRNA codons in order to bring complementary amino acids to the ribosome. As these amino acids are linked together, the chain elongates until a STOP codon is read which signals termination of the synthesis process.	cad452fa966458280061a84078ac5155	-1	
5	Leaving the nucleus, mRNA attaches itself to a ribosome where translation occurs. Here, tRNA brings complementary amino acids to build up a new protein molecule by reading off codons found on mRNA.

The codes are divided into triplets known as codons, which match up their complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules connecting adjacent amino acids based off of START and STOP codes	2b2e8f7314184d4399bf1b7a724eff39	-1	
5	Starting at the nucleus, mRNA voyage exits through nuclear pores before settling in ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum. Codons are broken down into trinucleotide units, recognized by matching them up with their respective complementary anticodons on tRNAs thereby linking amino acids based off of START/STOP markers	7ca09509e9157cb8986bfe8d558e6a0b	-1	
5	MRNA departs from the nucleus via nuclear pores before arriving at either ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum where it is translated. Its three-base sequences known as codons are matched up with their corresponding anticodons on tRNAs so adjacent amino acids may be linked according to START/STOP signals	61defca2e8435b9d25de287cf388f492	-1	
5	The mRNA molecule commences its journey from the nucleus outwards via nuclear pores prior to being examined in either ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum. Its code is divided up into 3-base units referred to as codons, which find their suitable complementary anticodons within tRNAs linking up adjacent amino acids per START/STOP markers	d221a9653a807485811983129218ecc9	-1	
5	To begin protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores and heads towards its destination - either a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is subsequently divided up into 3-base units known as codons where they match up with their respective complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules, forming proteins based off of START/STOP codes.	8af9e420213bfde1eb0206322d7d9003	-1	
5	MRNA starts off in the nucleus before exiting via nuclear pore en route to either ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum where it will find itself being translated. Its 3-base sequences referred to as codons attach themselves to their complementary anticodons found on tRNA molecules thereby connecting adjacent amino acids via START/STOP indicators	3c24f8072c143e67a4c25adf76c8bb2e	-1	
5	From inside of its origin - nuclei - MRNA takes off using its nuclear portals before reaching its terminal points - ribosomes & endoplasmic reticulum - where it encounters translation processes. Its trinucleotide sequences otherwise known as 'codons' create alliances with compatible 'anticodons' on tRNA molecules allowing for linkage of neighboring amino acids marked by START/STOP signs.	8997525f4018b9015679757d5d89bf67	-1	
5	Leaving behind its birthplace in nuclei, MRNA moves out of this area utilizing nuclear portals headed for either ribosomes or rough endoplasmic reticulum where it faces translation events. In this scenario it breaks down its base pairings labeled 'codons' that match up perfectly with 'anticodons' located within tRNA molecules thus linking adjacent amino acids according to defined START/STOP regulations.	cfc438147f68ae68a420aa58590d5e2a	-1	
5	In order for protein synthesis to take place, mRNA must set out from nuclei via nuclear pores steering itself towards ribosomes & rough ERs where it will be translated. In this step its triple base pairings given names 'codons' lock themselves onto compatible 'anticodons' provided by tRNA molecules that in turn link neighboring amino acids supported by START/STOP directives.	9d96ee9dc4eebd1592399a652d823e71	-1	
5	To get protein synthesis going MRNA begins its venture from nuclei equipped with nuclear gateways straight towards ribosomes & rough ERs where it finds available translation services. It is here where it breaks down its trinucleotide pairings known as 'codons' that connect themselves onto corresponding 'anticodons' located inside tRNA molecules allowing for binding of neighboring aminos based off START/STOP orders.	640bd2e4a7c8e5d10968f140c1588938	-1	
5	A journey commences outside of nuclei made possible by means of gene escape hatches made available through nuclear portals leading outwards towards target destinations consisting of either ribosomes & rough ERs for translation purposes. Trinucleotide pairings titled 'codons' find matching partners otherwise referred to as 'anticodons' within tRNA molecules providing links between adjacent aminos driven forth by specified START/STOP protocols.	0566587fbcbb8db8e07c3f5e87b9e179	-1	
5	Protein synthesis requires MRNA taking off from nuclei taking advantage of its inherent nuclear gates pointing towards either ribosomes or ERs where translation takes place. Thereupon it decodes its trinucleotide arrangements named 'codons' matching them up accordingly against similar 'anticodons' located within tRNA molecules allowing for connection between aminos guided by established START/STOP procedures.	95af7700dd9171986e8e3ca49c062434	-1	
5	Getting protein synthesis underway involves MRNA farewelling nuclei using built-in passageways leading outwards towards desired locations including either ribosomes & ERs preparing itself for translation practices. It divides its triple base groupings commonly called 'codons' that fit comfortably alongside analogous 'anticodons' situated inside tRNA molecules paving ways for linkage between aminos powered by programmed START/STOP commands.	fa53a7527e1d1bfba1fa28e62392aeb0	-1

5	2. The mRNA enters the cytoplasm, and its base pairs are read in triplets called 'codoons'. What strange creatures these must be!	17b113b4d7bd7f03dda27b2788f253b9	-1	
5	3. Then, tRNA carrying complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the codon of the mRNA. What an amazing feat!	dcde1fcff7b9ddb940544b6712e0dd01	-1	
5	4. Each tRNA brings with it a corresponding amino acid, which is added to the chain of amino acids to form a protein. Wow!	e906ace58739a760ef66c46feb3f967e	-1	
5	5. This process begins with initiation, in which the START codon is read on the mRNA in site P.	92105c26e0e2f2786390e8810a82b171	-1	
5	6. Elongation and termination occurs when STOP codons are read on the mRNA in site A. It's so exciting!	23e88f0c81ac214daf69882db76c4843	-1

5	mRNA exits the nucleus and goes through three more steps before it is translated into a protein: initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, the mRNA attaches itself to the ribosome, where it is then translated into amino acid triplets. Elongation involves the growing of the polypeptide chain by a process called translation, which adds amino acids one at a time to the growing protein. Finally, termination occurs when the ribosome reaches one of three stop codons on the mRNA and releases the newly-formed protein.	dbab424b8970ba34707f5ab128a706df	-1	
5	MRNA first transcribed in the nucleus leaves to be translated into proteins through initiation, elongation, and termination processes. Initiation is when the mRNA binds to the ribosome, which then reads and translates it into an amino acid triplet sequence. In elongation, each amino acid is added to the chain until a stop codon is reached. Finally, termination signals for the release of the new formed protein.	ce38d21a1625744529dc2bd21c9718bb	-1

Finally, post-translational modifications can occur to alter the overall shape and characteristics of the final protein.	8438d5b3e13fabf03b476bf358f991e7	-1	
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and going to the ribosomes in order to be translated. The mRNA is decoded by tRNA to form amino acid chains.

Then it travels through cytoplasm where it binds to ribosomes which catalyze translation-decoding codons into their respective amino acids using tRNAs-until producing the complete chain of amino acid residues forming the desired protein.	1b72520262b943da43a9a0e81c09ae43	-1	
5	The process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA being released from the nucleus containing coding sequences from genes.

This forms polypeptides that are later assembled into functional proteins.	95f7f0b19f820a255fa5ca1429a1384a	-1	
5	The journey towards transforming gene information into a functioning protein begins with mRNA departing from the nucleus with its set of codons.

5	First off, mRNA transcribed from genes must leave the nucleus carrying genetic information about what type of protein is going to be produced. After that, in cytoplasm it binds to ribosomes initiating translation-an activity where codons are decoded into their respective amino acids using tRNAs-until producing the complete chain of amino acid residues forming said protein.	37d4e643a808788d78ad9a36bddf8106	-1	
5	The initial step in producing proteins involves mRNA leaving its host in the nucleus carrying codes from genes. It moves on to cytoplasm where it binds with ribosomes initiating translation-a process involving decoding codons into their corresponding amino acids aided by tRNAs-until finally assembling them as one long chain forming an entire desired protein.	53f843bdfb1d2d5665b88c2492e6b2ff	-1

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is the binding of the mRNA to a ribosome which is responsible for decoding the genetic message contained in the mRNA. Next, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome that are needed for building the protein according to the instructions encoded in the mRNA. The third step in this process is called translation, in which the triplet codons on mRNA are matched up with their corresponding tRNA anticodons and the amino acids they carry are then joined up to form a new polypeptide chain. Lastly, this chain may be further modified depending on the requirements of the specific protein being synthesized.	e47db7e80f371fddb948a018c7c30612	-1

5	The first step in protein synthesis is that mRNA leaves the nucleus so that it can attach to a ribosome in the cytoplasm.

Finally, post-translational modifications are made for functional activity.	4c9bbb01dcfc922ebf6fea96bbeba403	-1

This process is further regulated by transfer RNA molecules and various enzymes.	9980d9d83948f349ec5ce475fbbb9b50	-1	
5	The four steps in protein synthesis begin with mRNA transcription in the nucleus, followed by post-transcriptional processing, translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide in the cytoplasm, and termination or regulation of translation.	ac5bef69c87865b40af6e91d62552cdd	-1	
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it binds to a ribosome, which acts as a building site for protein synthesis. Ribosomes then read the mRNA code and recruit transfer RNAs (tRNA) with the corresponding amino acids.	dc775f20f0433170f0196f500528f302	-1	
5	The second step in protein synthesis is when the tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome, allowing it to be transcribed into a chain of amino acids. This process is repeated until the full protein sequence has been built.	c76bb33bf80342bc52f525645dec6578	-1	
5	Next, the ribosome will check if the newly formed sequence is correct. If not, transcription will stop and the incomplete protein will be released.	788702145dc9acd79002ee0954223601	-1	
5	Finally, after the initial checks have been passed, the completed protein can be released from the ribosome and sent to other parts of the cell for further processing.	c5131d1dfe04aa92a522a6fd0dd539fa	-1	
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and will then interact with a ribosome, which will then convert the mRNA into a protein. This process is known as translation.	3cc324d35bb60c0f9ca412919d31018f	-1	
5	When mRNA departs from the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes where it is translated. The translation process occurs in three steps: recognition of the codon, tRNA selection and peptide bond formation.	5a040ac99293ae0a387f10fd5a610e81	-1	
5	The mRNA generated inside the nucleus binds to a ribosome, initiating the process of translation. Then the codon pairs with an anticodon on the tRNA, allowing for amino acids to be added to the growing protein chain. Finally, peptide bonds are formed between adjacent amino acids that get added.	5c3218b0725c4e0409297726409d8054	-1	
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is sent to the ribosomes where it is decoded into amino acid sequences to be assembled into proteins. After that, codons in the mRNA are read one by one and complementary tRNA molecules bring appropriate amino acids that become linked together to form a growing peptide chain.	644a8af626bc652a9aa1a4749167e103	-1	
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA travels from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The next step involves translating the mRNA instructions through decoding codons onto transfer RNA molecules. These will then attach specific amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain followed by forming peptide bonds between them.	d682600deed8d4f2b5940dc4ca869059	-1	
5	The first phase of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and migrates to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Then, each codon on the mRNA is transcribed into a corresponding tRNA molecule. Subsequently, these tRNAs join up with ribosomes and bring in amino acids that link together forming a polypeptide chain.	bc9047c188bddc1d6bcdbf118762277c	-1	
5	The protein synthesis process starts after mRNA leaves the nucleus due to its instructions being needed in the cytoplasm. It first undergoes decoding by matching up with transfer RNAs carrying corresponding amino acids and lining them up in order. Then peptide bonds hold each amino acid together to form a long protein chain.	a11947216198602ec7cd4957cb60b6ef	-1	
5	Once mRNA exits the nucleus, four major steps occur: it binds to a ribosome; codons pair up with tRNA; amino acids are brought in; and finally, peptide bonds form between consecutive amino acids.	6c6cff71132e12cfbc921230bb39baf6	-1	
5	The protein synthesis procedure initiates when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves towards its destination -the ribosome. There it gets decoded, resulting in a transfer RNA bringing in appropriate amino acids needed for assembly of a polypeptide chain. Lastly, peptide bonds develop between each consecutive amino acid.	0b177a23d94633f96812f80f6c67f807	-1	
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins once mRNA exits the nucleus. Upon arriving at its destination -the ribosome- it undergoes decoding. Each codon on the mRNA pairs up with an individual anticodon on tRNA molecules carrying corresponding amino acids needed for assembly of a polypeptide chain followed by peptide bond formation.	c0ad141c6924b4c84deeb99dd0755d3c	-1	
5	As mRNA passes out of the nucleus, four major steps take place during protein synthesis: binding with ribosomes; pairing up with tRNAs; bringing in corresponding amino acids; and forming peptide bonds between consecutive amino acids.	4fc159d4c031dda527de54a0bd570d0b	-1	
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA travels out of its home -the nucleus- and into its destination -the ribosome-. This travel sets off four major processes: binding with ribosomes; matching up with transfer RNAs; bringing in required amino acids; and synthesizing peptides between them.	cde67772615f5fb4a5af7ecd7540b69d	-1

5	Beginning with mRNA travelling from the nucleus, four major steps occur during protein synthesis: translation, assembly, folding and post-translational modifications. Translation involves decoding the genetic code stored on mRNA by ribosomes.	caafd83e8be28382a6c743acd44cfcc9	-1	
5	As soon as mRNA leaves the nucleus, protein synthesis can commence. During this process, ribosomes translate genetic code stored on mRNA into individual amino acids which are then assembled in an exact sequence before the structure can be properly folded.	37c97e30668da6bda09e15d98e8712df	-1	
5	The process of producing proteins begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus containing genetic information for each type of protein. This information is read by ribosomes which proceed to decode it into individual amino acids before they are connected in a particular arrangement forming polypeptides.	d995b9211dbf408fbed9922ad2be8864	-1	
5	Starting with mRNA going out of the nucleus, there are four steps involved in protein synthesis: translation, assembly, folding and post-translational modifications.

5	Once mRNA exits from nuclei for translation at the start of protein synthesis, several steps follow including decoding via ribosomes; subsequently arranging them in their particular sequence; and finally shaping them up as functional proteins.	d3ae47a98f84bb52bea390e262abae73	-1	
5	Protein synthesis starts as soon as Messenger RNA molecules depart from nuclear sites towards cytoplasmic regions. From there onwards, they will be decoded by ribosomes; organized as desired sequences; and shaped up as functional proteins.	308cd75a0760ca57ee20e4444d71f01f	-1	
5	Messenger RNA strands have to leave nuclear sites if protein production is to make progress afterwards; such strands carry genetic pieces thus they need to be decoded by associated ribosomal structures; thereafter followed by assembling related chains; plus creating respective functions from them ultimately.	8d4f08c00fb523c9c184a3bfc7ac3ad7	-1	
5	To kick off protein formation going forth at initial stages; Messenger RNA strands have to come out from nuclear scopes; or else reading related strands would not possible until such time henceforth decoding them with assistance from relevant ribosomal structures; plus combining related components uniquely; later forming up distinctive functions accordingly eventually.	1bf1bc7ca3c67fc4fda8ba598b8b2cbd	-1	
5	At early stages of proceeding ahead with regarding creation of related proteins; Messenger RNA molecules have to emerge out from nuclear boundaries firstly; for translation purposes thereafter since they carry gene-related information mostly; such that deciphering them with help provided via relative ribosomal bodies necessarily would happen later on too; coupled with fixing related components suitably like so; also making respective roles out aptly indeed finally thereby.	4f19b85b5318e8bfd09900b1364036dd	-1

5	Molecular translation begins after mRNA has left the nucleus and arrived at a ribosome. At this point tRNA molecules can attach themselves to codons on mRNA strands that correspond with amino acids, forming peptide chains.	03079fcb51930755fbe9ef670b487c5e	-1	
5	Once mRNA has left from its source inside the nucleus and reached a ribosome in the cytoplasm it can begin translation. This consists of matching up tRNA molecules with codons on mRNA so as to create amino acid sequences.	eb23c163813ee8a21b809e5ca19a73da	-1

5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis occurs quieter than a midnight in the Commons. During initiation, the P site reads a START codon and adds a new corresponding amino acid to a tRNA, while elongation and termination join amino acids onto adjacent tRNA’s denser than chowder, until a STOP codon is read at the A site - slower than molasses in January.	f86451985c94c5c9eae0f31815441435	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is transported to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA molecules which carry complementary anticodons recognize the appropriate codon of the mRNA and link the corresponding amino acids together starting with a START codon in the P site. The bonded amino acids are then joined by additional tRNA's to form a protein.	403e22281b1c777aaa4a8273ce307345	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA travelling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is read in triplets of nucleotides - called codons - by ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

This process continues until a stop codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination of this process.	efd01d546a87ebdc81cde3848a96374a	3	3
5	Cutting corners won't get you far: mRNA must leave the nucleus, and then tRNA with complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, adding the corresponding amino acid to the tRNA.

5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and then is read by tRNA which carries the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon to the codon of the mRNA. This starts the process of protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site, and amino acids are added to the tRNA. Subsequently, those amino acids are linked together and adjacent tRNA's amino acids are bonded to form a new corresponding amino acid, completing the process.	cb499cfa09b5d761c5a1e83f52d35176	3	3
5	mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus and then leaves the cell via the nuclear pore, travelling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it is read by rRNA in triplets called codons. The START codon in the P site triggers initiation, and amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is read in the A site, resulting in the formation of a protein.	21b5168f2cc8b27ca3dc415a9db3e5e5	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA being exuded from the nucleus through nuclear pores, making its way to ribosomes where tRNA molecules read and translate codons into amino acids in a process of elongation and termination until a STOP codon is read, as tight as a beaver's dam and twisted as Toronto's streets - solid as Canadian Shield.	9eaf6099fb86ce7af1fe456de6442fcd	3	3
5	RNA molecules are first synthesized in the nucleus before travelling to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize the codons of the mRNA, allowing a new corresponding amino acid to be added.

5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read by ribosomes, which link amino acids together in a chain on tRNA as codons until it reaches a stop codon.

5	Beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, four major steps are involved in protein synthesis: mRNA codons are read in three-letter strings; tRNA brings complementary amino acids to the ribosome; the corresponding tRNA and amino acid molecules bond together; and a new peptide chain is formed as adjacent molecules link up.	bfaa320bb559271ea0899ab3c26fb606	3	3
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis occurs quieter than a midnight in the Commons. During initiation, the P site reads a START codon and adds a new corresponding amino acid to a tRNA, while elongation and termination join amino acids onto adjacent tRNAâ€™s denser than chowder, until a STOP codon is read at the A site - slower than molasses in January.	f86451985c94c5c9eae0f31815441435	3	3
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is transported to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA molecules which carry complementary anticodons recognize the appropriate codon of the mRNA and link the corresponding amino acids together starting with a START codon in the P site. The bonded amino acids are then joined by additional tRNA's to form a protein.	403e22281b1c777aaa4a8273ce307345	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA travelling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is read in triplets of nucleotides - called codons - by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This information is then used by transfer RNA (tRNA) to bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, thus joining them together. This process continues until a stop codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination of this process.	efd01d546a87ebdc81cde3848a96374a	3	3
5	Cutting corners won't get you far: mRNA must leave the nucleus, and then tRNA with complementary anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, adding the corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. After that, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNAâ€™s amino acids and finally, it travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	f5e72fa060599af5bffbf0c27452591f	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying codons in triplets which are read by ribosomal RNA (rRNA); this triggers the transfer of a complementary anticodon on a tRNA molecule, linking it to an amino acid and allowing for a START codon to be recognized in the P-site.

5	Beginning in the nucleus, protein synthesis involves the mRNA travelling through the nuclear pore before binding to a ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by tRNA carrying complementary anticodons recognizing complementary codons on the mRNA and adding new corresponding amino acids to it. Finally, these amino acids are linked until a STOP codon is read, thus terminating the process.	afd2e0136e4348e669735009906aa6e1	3	3
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and then is read by tRNA which carries the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon to the codon of the mRNA. This starts the process of protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site, and amino acids are added to the tRNA. Subsequently, those amino acids are linked together and adjacent tRNA's amino acids are bonded to form a new corresponding amino acid, completing the process.	cb499cfa09b5d761c5a1e83f52d35176	3	3
5	mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus and then leaves the cell via the nuclear pore, travelling through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it is read by rRNA in triplets called codons. The START codon in the P site triggers initiation, and amino acids are linked together until a STOP codon is read in the A site, resulting in the formation of a protein.	21b5168f2cc8b27ca3dc415a9db3e5e5	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA being exuded from the nucleus through nuclear pores, making its way to ribosomes where tRNA molecules read and translate codons into amino acids in a process of elongation and termination until a STOP codon is read, as tight as a beaver's dam and twisted as Toronto's streets - solid as Canadian Shield.	9eaf6099fb86ce7af1fe456de6442fcd	3	3
5	RNA molecules are first synthesized in the nucleus before travelling to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize the codons of the mRNA, allowing a new corresponding amino acid to be added. This process is facilitated by the exit of mRNA from the nucleus via nuclear pores.	afece4b3f6d9b9aa8632546b0ffdf16b	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read by ribosomes, which link amino acids together in a chain on tRNA as codons until it reaches a stop codon. This resulting chain is then transported to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it's as damp as a dungeon and cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey but as strong as a lion.	25cf9e360c27b7a689010ae850150405	3	2
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four main steps: initiation, in which a START codon is read in the P site; elongation, where amino acids are added one at a time to the growing chain until a STOP codon is reached; termination, where the chain is released; and translation, where the tRNA molecules link up with the appropriate amino acids, forming a protein as solid as the Canadian Shield.	45d51e9e5f942df300e7e60d89ae1a30	3	3
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus via a nuclear pore, then 'strong as a lion', the mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, amino acids are linked together, starting with a start codon in the P site (initiation) and continuing until a stop codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination). As thin as a rake, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA each step of the way.	33387531a5964e7b3126af8e8fbca544	3	3
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore, where it is read in triplets called codons by ribosomal RNA.

5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.

Lastly, the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, as many a mickle maks a muckle.	ca9bb631e91379abfa7bc7f270e5f26d	3	3

5	Well, I reckon it's like this. First off, after that mRNA does leave the nucleus, it goes barkin' up the wrong tree to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, like a coonhound on a scent. That there mRNA gets translated into what we call a polypeptide chain in a process slower than molasses in January, but just as sure. Then, that polypeptide takes its shape - folds and coils up like a rattler in the sun. Lastly, looks like you got yourself a protein when it finishes foldin’! Ain't exactly like findin' a needle in a haystack, but it's important all the same.	1b4d0fa1b45a920cbd7d59894712cd0e	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, this step is known as transcription. The mRNA then associates with ribosomes in a process called translation, where each codon in the mRNA molecule corresponds to a specific amino acid carried by a tRNA molecule. These amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide chain, creating the primary structure of the protein. The chain is then folded into a three-dimensional shape to form the protein's final structure, which is essential for its function.	2cb71a57c769c3b443fefaffe4179d01	-1	-1
5	"The four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. ""Transcription"" - Inside the nucleus, the information from the DNA is transcribed or copied into a molecule called mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).  2. ""RNA Processing"" - The mRNA undergoes processing where it is edited and certain sections called introns are removed. 3. ""Translation"" - The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell where it is translated by ribosomes into a chain of amino acids to form a protein based on the instructions coded in the mRNA. 4. ""Protein Folding"" - The chain of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional structure to become a functional protein. Each protein has a unique shape that allows it to perform its specific function in the body."	5647e3c265e1c2f03e40e46fb76d564b	-1	-1
5	The process of photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll in a plant's leaves, converting it into chemical energy through a series of reactions known as the Calvin cycle.

5	Protein synthesis includes these four main steps: 1) Transcription: In the nucleus, a part of the DNA molecule uncoils and serves as a template for mRNA formation. 2) mRNA Processing: After transcription, mRNA gets processed where introns are removed and exons are joined together. 3) Translation: Now, this processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. The encoded message in mRNA is translated into amino acids which form a protein. 4) Protein Folding: These amino acid chains fold into a specific shape to form a functional protein.	3841b57f6050c2afb494da5cfbd05a85	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, protein synthesis starts off with mRNA bein' faster than a jackrabbit on a date, leavin' the nucleus to head out to the ribosome. Now, here's four key steps for ya:  1. Translation initiation: This ain't happened in a coon's age! The ribosome hooks up with that mRNA and the first tRNA so protein production can begin. 2. Elongation: Off like a herd of turtles, the amino acids get added one by one, turned into a polypeptide chain. 3. Translocation: Now, the ribosome moves along that mRNA, readin' it like it's yesterday's newspaper. 4. Termination: Last but not least, we hit a stop codon and it's game over - our new protein is ready for foldin' and functionin'.	ac662c126e2bb47b685938b65d497d9b	-1	-1

5	Well, butter my biscuit, this ain't the right tree to bark up, friend! Protein synthesis is a fancy dance that starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads out into the cell.  Step one is transportation - the mRNA, with its blueprint for the protein, leaves the nucleus and moseys on over to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. That's where the real work's gonna get done. Step two is initiation. This is where the ribosome gets all gussied up and ready to read that mRNA like a map to grandma’s house. Step three is elongation, which don't mean what it sounds like. It's just a big word for when the ribosome starts hooking together amino acids, line by line, following that mRNA blueprint.  And lastly, we got termination. After the ribosome has hooked all them amino acids together according to plan, it stops work and releases the finished protein. And there you have it - from start to finish - how a protein gets made. Now isn’t that slicker than snot on a doorknob?	06c421b7e44baea97afe5054e05dd030	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. Following this, four major steps occur: 1) Transcription: Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA; 2) mRNA Processing: The mRNA then undergoes processing including splicing and addition of a poly-A tail and 5' cap; 3) Translation: The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome. Here tRNA molecules deliver amino acids to the ribosome where they are assembled into a polypeptide chain; 4) Protein Folding: The polypeptide chain folds into its final protein structure, guided by chaperone proteins.	26cb426940635c5873d858a5b82d3fba	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with transcription in the nucleus where DNA is used as a template to create mRNA. The first major step following this is called mRNA processing, during which the mRNA strand is altered and prepared for transportation out of the nucleus. Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm where the second major step, translation, takes place in the ribosome. During translation, tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. These amino acids are then linked together to form a polypeptide chain, which is the third major step. Lastly, this chain undergoes folding and modification in order to become a functional protein, marking the fourth and final step of protein synthesis.	063555bd5104fc899df99ea174075081	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis involves the mRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing four major steps. Firstly, there's transcription where DNA in the nucleus is copied into mRNA. This mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in the second step known as initiation. The third step, elongation, sees transfer RNA (tRNA) decoding the mRNA sequence into amino acids which connect to form a protein chain. Finally, during termination, the protein chain is released when the ribosome encounters a stop codon on the mRNA, concluding protein synthesis.	097a4f791c981295cb5950f6d86535f8	-1	-1

5	"Well, bless your heart for askin', hon. Let's get right down to the grit of it. Now, the journey starts with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus like a rabbit runnin' from a hound dog.  Step one is what folks call ""Transcription"". That's when DNA done turns into mRNA inside the nucleus. It's kinda like makin' a copy of grandma's old gumbo recipe so you don't ruin the original - you're workin' with a copy instead. Then we got step two, and that's ""mRNA Processing"". Here, the mRNA gets itself all gussied up before it heads on out of the nucleus - it's like puttin' on your Sunday best before church, just to make sure everything is in order. Step three is ""Translation"". Now this happens in the ribosome, which is kind of like the kitchen where the cookin' happens. The mRNA brings in the recipe and tRNA (which is like your groceries) brings the amino acids needed to whip up the protein. Last but not least is step four, ""Protein Folding"". This here stage is as important as kneadin' your biscuit dough just right. The string of amino acids folds up into a specific shape, 'cause each protein has its own unique form - just like how everyone likes their biscuits a little different. So there y'all have it - from startin' out in the nucleus to endin' up with a finished protein.

5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus.  1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, a segment of DNA is unzipped by RNA polymerase enzyme, allowing the mRNA to form a complementary copy of one of the strands, which then leaves the nucleus. 2. Translation: Once mRNA is in the cytoplasm, it attaches to a ribosome where its information is read and translated into an amino acid sequence by tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid. 3. Polypeptide formation: The amino acids brought by tRNA are linked together in the order specified by the mRNA to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein folding: The newly formed polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional shape to become a functional protein, depending on its sequence of amino acids.	816573de18e10e52a30085e09bb3e913	-1	-1

5	"To answer your question, the process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, a wee journey that's as exciting as a ceilidh. First off, we have transcription, where the DNA is used as a template to make our wee messenger RNA (mRNA). It's like when your granny knits a scarf using a pattern. She reads the instructions and turns it into something tangible – in this case, the mRNA strand. Next up is the part I like to call ""The Great Exodus."" The mRNA is as high as a kite and leaves the nucleus, heading for the cytoplasm. It's like when you're leaving a crowded pub on a Saturday night, it can get a bit rough but our mRNA makes it out into the wide open space of the cytoplasm. Then we have translation, which is a bit like translating Scots slang for someone who hasnae got a scooby. The ribosome reads the mRNA and translates it into an amino acid sequence. The tRNA plays a crucial part here - it brings over the right amino acids for the job, making sure everything fits together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Finally, there's protein folding. This can be heavy as a lead balloon if it goes wrong. The string of amino acids fold into a unique shape that determines what job the protein will do in the body. If it folds rightly, then we end up with functional proteins that help us stay healthy. If not... well, let's say it's cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey. So, there you have it – from transcription in the nucleus to protein folding in the cytoplasm, that's how protein synthesis works."	adfb898eceaec48b149499e343ad5a99	-1	-1

5	You betcha! So, the first thing's gonna be transcripshon up in the nucleus. This is when the mRNA takes notes from the DNA, kinda like your cousin Jimmy cheats off you durin’ the SATs. Then it’s game time: The mRNA heads outta the nucleus faster than a Sox fan leavin' Yankee Stadium.  Next stop? The cytoplasm. Here, ribosomes're gonna read the mRNA, bit by bit -- think of it as checkin' a recipe one step at a time so you don't muck it up. This process is called translashon. While this is goin’ on, tRNA’s bringing over amino acids -- these guys are like the bricks needed to build our protein house. They attach to the ribosome and link up based on what the mRNA's tellin' 'em.  Finally, once all those amino acids are linked up tighter than traffic on Storrow Drive during rush hour, you got yourself a new protein! Just remember though, any mistake along the way can mess things up worse than Fenway Park after a double header against the Yanks.	6725f299d7ce8fb5c50a6d27b64f35e9	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's start our journey from the mRNA packed suitcase leaving its nucleus home. First, it takes a trip down the cytoplasm highway - that's translation initiation. Like showing an invite at a jol, this process involves our mRNA binding to a small ribosome subunit, before a tRNA rocks up carrying an amino acid. Next step is elongation, where tRNA molecules match their anticodons to the mRNA codons - like fitting puzzle pieces together. Then we've got termination, as light as a feather, it's when the protein synthesis comes to a halt once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA. Lastly, post-translational modification is like adding final touches, ekse, it involves chemical changes to the protein molecule to make it ready for work. It's not that complicated - just small-small steps to follow. But in biology, every small step can be as important as rain in the dry Karoo!	1cef85d2158b2a98997073290a891cf4	-1	-1

5	Well now, ya got me feelin' like a fish outta water here! But let me holler at ya 'bout this. First off, that mRNA, bless its heart, zips on out of the nucleus fixin' to start some ruckus. It's like the town gossip passin' around vital news.  Then we mosey on over to step two where that mRNA finds itself a ribosome to get cozy with, kinda like two peas in a pod. That there ribosome reads the mRNA in groups of three bases called codons. It's as if the ribosome is readin' a recipe for one of grandma's famous peach pies - each codon is an ingredient. Movin' right along, tRNA swoops in like a Southern belle at a cotillion, carryin' an amino acid. Now this ain't any ol’ hootenanny; each tRNA has an anticodon that matches up with that mRNA codon, making sure everybody’s in step. Finally, them amino acids join together to form a polypeptide chain - it's like watchin' folks hold hands for grace at Sunday supper - and this chain folds up into one heck of a protein. Now ain't that somethin'? That little old mRNA sure stirs up quite the shindig! Just remember, it's all hat, no cattle without each part playin' its role just right.	1398253d524c822909b48a87e2486830	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The first step is transcription, where the DNA code gets copied into mRNA in the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, in a process called translation, ribosomes read this mRNA code and assemble amino acids to form a protein. Then comes post-translational modifications where the protein undergoes various processes like folding and cutting for proper functioning. Finally, these proteins either get secreted out of the cell or stay inside based on their role and function.	5eab61be52f9950cec98a2e43179908c	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA does leave the nucleus, right? This be like when ripe fruit must drop. It then joins with the ribosome, which we might say is like when stone under water nuh know when sun hot, it just accept whatever comes. Next up, tRNA comes into play to match with mRNA's codons; this be like new broom sweeps clean. Then, amino acids start to join together to form a protein chain, akin to how every mikkle mek a mukkle. The final step is where the protein folds into its unique shape - one hand can't clap, right? It need its structure to function correctly. So, isn't it amazing how from a simple mRNA strand leaving the nucleus, we get a complex protein?	7bed391d3765d49f979e26334f25180a	-1	-1
5	The four major steps of photosynthesis start with the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll in plant leaves. Then, water molecules are broken down in the light-dependent reactions, releasing oxygen. During the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose. Finally, glucose, a form of energy, can be utilized by the plant for growth and reproduction.	3f52f1702df20c03ae2acec6185d642f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps involved are:  1. Transcription: In the nucleus, the DNA unzips, and mRNA copies the code from one strand of DNA. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, mRNA is processed where introns are removed and exons are reconnected. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm where tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids corresponding to the codon sequence on the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: The chain of amino acids folds into a specific shape to form a protein, completing protein synthesis.	b40b52b36e23b4d9c555cf3476efd6db	-1	-1
5	Well, ya know, the first step is like herding cats. That mRNA has gotta up and at 'em outta the nucleus. Then, you ain't seen nothin' in a coon's age till that ribosome latches on and starts readin' it like a recipe, makin' them amino acids into a protein chain. Last but not least, the Golgi apparatus steps in, sorta like the post office of the cell, packagin' and sendin' off that protein where it needs to go. Fairly simple process when you get down to it!	ccef6d6a6a9935512b81694b037d1a18	-1	-1

5	The process of photosynthesis begins when a seed is planted in fertile soil and watered regularly. After this, the plant receives sunlight, which triggers the production of chlorophyll and begins the process of converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.	6362263ef10f423e34b91370345b36ba	-1	-1

5	The process of protein synthesis involves four major steps, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This is where it all begins in the nucleus. DNA - our genetic blueprint - is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). This step essentially involves creating an mRNA copy of a specific section of DNA that codes for a particular protein. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA can leave the nucleus, it has to undergo some modifications or processing. This includes adding a cap and tail for protection and removing any non-coding sections, also known as introns, to ensure only the necessary information (exons) is included. 3. Translation: Now comes the exciting part! The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it meets up with a cellular structure called a ribosome. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the information on the mRNA in sets of three bases called codons, each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid. 4. Protein Folding: The final step happens after the ribosome has translated the entire mRNA sequence into a chain of amino acids creating a polypeptide chain. This chain will then fold into a unique shape to form our desired protein. The folding process is crucial because the function of a protein is determined by its shape. Each of these steps represents an intricate dance between molecules that keeps our cells functioning correctly and us alive!	b53e9c0a34a99af2e0d76636eaa0481c	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process, isn't it? It begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. Would you believe that this is where the action truly starts? In the first step, known as transcription, the DNA's information is copied onto a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). Isn't it interesting how nature has its own copy-paste mechanism? This mRNA then exits the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm. In the second stage, translation, isn't it amazing that the mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome, which reads the sequence of mRNA bases? Now do you understand why each triplet of bases, called a codon, corresponds to one amino acid in a polypeptide chain? The third step includes tRNA molecules bringing amino acids to the ribosome based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. What if I told you that each tRNA has a specific anticodon that pairs with an mRNA codon?  Finally, these amino acids are linked together in order to form a polypeptide chain – isn’t it intriguing how this process works like assembly line production? Once completed, this chain folds into a functional protein. Now, doesn't all this make you marvel at how meticulously our cells work?	aaaa9dcbcba64e7558882a5ec509e9b9	-1	-1
5	Weel, let's get crackin' on this richt fascinatin' process then, shall we?  1. mRNA's Great Escape: Afore anything else can happen, mRNA has tae up an make its way oot the nucleus. It’s a bit like that moment when ye finally get off work an’ cannae wait tae head doon the pub. 2. The Meet n' Greet at the Ribosome: Next, ye've got yer mRNA meetin' up wi' a ribosome; they come thegither like old pals at a ceilidh. 3. tRNA – The Middle Man: Now, this part involves tRNA, or as I like tae call it - the middle man. Each wee bit o' tRNA carries an amino acid an’ matches it up wi' the correct codon on the mRNA. It's as precise as a master tailor matchin' thread colours. 4. Stitchin' it All Together: And finally, these amino acids get stitched together into a polypeptide chain by the ribosome – forming a protein! It’s a bit like how your gran might knit a sweater, only this one’s invisible and happens inside your cells!	aff51e61bcb798fa3c0551ba8ba5213a	-1	-1

5	Right, so once that there mRNA steps out of the nucleus, we've got this hoedown startin'. First off, it gets snatched up by a ribosome quicker than a rabbit on a hot tin roof. This is what we call 'translation initiation'. Second comes the 'elongation' - this is when tRNA starts adding amino acids to the growing protein chain, kinda like adding links to a chain fence. Thirdly, we've got 'termination', which is when that ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA and knows it's time to let go of that finished protein. Lastly, but not leastly, that new protein undergoes some 'post-translational modifications' - you could say it gets all gussied up for its big debut. It might get folded up into its proper shape or have some atoms added to its structure to make sure that dog'll hunt properly!	427a66aa7fc924a2089ca354f7ca830f	-1	-1
5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: In the cell's nucleus, a strand of DNA is used as a template to manufacture a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA carries the genetic information needed for protein synthesis. 2. mRNA Transport: The newly formed mRNA molecule then travels out of the nucleus and into the cell's cytoplasm, where it will guide the synthesis of proteins. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome, where its genetic code can be read by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA molecule brings the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome based on the code it reads on the mRNA. 4. Assembly: As each amino acid is added to the growing chain in the correct sequence, a polypeptide chain is formed. This chain folds into a specific shape to become a functional protein.	62cf194cb3fcd81668a608b2854a80a1	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA replication in the nucleus. It then involves translation where tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, followed by elongation where peptide bonds form between amino acids, and finally termination when the protein is released. 1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: The process of protein synthesis initiates with transcription in the nucleus, where DNA is transcribed into mRNA or messenger RNA. After the transcription process, this mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: This step is marked by the interaction of the mRNA molecule with a ribosome (a cellular machine that reads mRNA and translates it into a protein). The ribosome binds to a specific site on the mRNA called the start codon, signaling the beginning of translation. 3. Elongation: As translation proceeds, new amino acids are brought by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA carries an amino acid that corresponds to the codon it recognizes on the mRNA. These amino acids are joined one-by-one, creating a chain that will become a protein. 4. Termination: The protein synthesis is completed when a stop codon on the mRNA is reached. Upon reaching this stop signal, the newly synthesized polypeptide chain is released by breaking its attachment to the tRNA at the site of the ribosome.  Therefore, these four steps illustrate how proteins are synthesized from a gene's instructions within our cells!	a2d7a38bbf743d0511315db2bbeaf6dd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts from ribosome in the cytoplasm, not mRNA leaving the nucleus. The first step is translation where tRNA molecules carrying amino acids attach to mRNA strand in the ribosome. Secondly, elongation stage occurs where peptide bonds form between adjacent amino acids forming polypeptide chain. Thirdly, translocation happens moving ribosome along mRNA strand. Lastly, termination occurs when stop codon is reached on mRNA and newly formed protein is released.	9e62bcdc82ee74b08894605db84f9fe8	-1	-1

5	Well, first ya gotta know that the mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus, right? Then we got four main steps in that protein synthesis, just as sure as the Sox love Fenway. First off, we got this thing called transcription inside the nucleus where the DNA is used as a blueprint for makin' mRNA. Next up, that mRNA heads for the exits and makes its way to the cytoplasm - almost like it's tryin' to catch the last T outta Downtown Crossing. Then comes translation, where the ribosome reads the mRNA and starts buildin' the protein, one amino acid at a time. It's like layin' bricks down on Tremont Street, each one fitting together just right.

It undergoes processing which includes splicing (removal of introns), addition of a cap and tail, resulting in a mature mRNA molecule ready for translation. 3. Translation: This occurs in the cytoplasm where the mRNA binds to a ribosome. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome which matches with specific three-base sequences on the mRNA known as codons. 4. Protein Folding: The assembled chain of amino acids detaches from the ribosome and folds into a complex three-dimensional structure under the assistance of chaperone proteins.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing from the nucleus. The four pivotal steps involved are: 1. Transcription: This is the initial stage where the DNA's information is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus. Here, RNA polymerase binds to a specific site on the DNA and unzips it, using one strand of the DNA as a template to assemble a complementary strand of mRNA. 2. Post-transcriptional Modification: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes some modifications before it leaves the nucleus. These include splicing (removal of introns), capping (addition of a cap at the 5' end), and polyadenylation (addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end). 3. Translation: The processed mRNA moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it attaches itself to a ribosome. The ribosome then translates the coded message of the mRNA into an amino acid sequence with help from another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA). 4. Protein Folding and Processing: Once the amino acid chain is formed, it folds itself into a functional three-dimensional protein structure under the guidance of molecules known as chaperones. Some proteins might also go through additional processing like cleavage or addition of other groups in order to become fully functional. In conclusion, these steps ensure that genetic information in DNA is accurately and efficiently converted into functional proteins, vital for all cellular activities.	0444d229eb08e924cad368326d825f3a	-1	-1

6	There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane.

Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.	14841	0	0

6	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.	14933	2	2

6	They can use their cilia, flagella or they could not move at all.	14969	0	0
6	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.	14975	3	3

6	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.	15251	3	3

6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are when the cell membrane uses proteins to allow substances through the membrane, when small particles enter through the cell membrane, and when particles too large to enter the membrane through proteins use enzymes to make the particles smaller.	15317	0	0

6	Osmosis, difusion, and phospholipid difusion are three processes by which a substance can move across the cell membrane. Osmosis is the dirusion of a substance through a selectively permeable membrane; usually a substance such as water. difusion is the difusion of other semi-small chemicals or atoms moving across the membrane. Phospholipid difusion is the difusion of larger chemicals or atoms across a membrane with the use of a protien.	15464	0	0

6	-Fission;  The incoming substances fuse with the cell membrance and enter the cell.-Lipids;  Substances go through the membrane through hole-like structures.-Packaging;  A substance goes into the membrane, which encases the substance.  Then the package is dumped inside the cell.	15537	0	0
6	Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane. Through osmosis, water can freely pass through the membrane. Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane. In passive transport, substances can freely pass through the membrane without requiring energy from ATP.Active transport is the passing of substances through the cell membrane through transport systems. These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane.	15544	3	3

6	The processes used by cells to control the movement of substance across the cell membrane by meiosis. They let the cell move or the cell would have a flagella.	15609	0	0
6	The cell can use endocystosis, which brings in nutrients and proteins from the outside by wrapping the cell membrane around it. They can also use exocystosis, which puts objects out nutrients and proteins by releasing them in a bubble. There is also the transport protein which allows small nutrients to pass through the membrane.	15612	0	3

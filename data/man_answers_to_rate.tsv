5	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.	12396	1	1
5	The four major steps involved in protein sylnthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus then it goes and gets the message decoded. After that then the body sends out the proper proteins. Lastly the proper proteins are sent and the process is started all over again.	11991	1	1
5	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus and locates in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes. Once it was relocated to the ribosomes it is transfered into rRNA and then read by the tRNA. Once the tRNA reads the information amino acids are produced and they are the building blocks of proteins.	11967	1	1
5	It then enters the ribosome in which it meets the tRNA and is then creating an even bigger strain of nucleic acid.	11260	1	1
5	First the mRNA is sent from the nucleus and sent to the ribosomes. Than it is changed into tRNA. After it is turned into tRNA it is sent to be turned into protein. Than when it is turned into a protein it is sent into the body to do it's job.	11566	1	1
5	Mrna connects to the ribosomeCodons read the letters then retrieve the correct amino acidThe amino acids are connnected to the mrna and taken into the ribosomeIn the ribosome the amino acids are used to make a protien	11515	1	1
5	mRNA takes genetic information out of the cell.tRNA brings amino acids with complementary codons to attach      to the mRNA strand.tRNA balances the chemical amounts that come with the amino acids.A protein is created with the new nucleotide sequence.	12276	1	1
5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through a process called transcription. The mRNA travels to a ribosome, and more proteins are made. As this is happening, the mRNA also continues to make more polypeptides on the strand. After this a complementary strand is formed, and another strand of DNA is made.	11980	1	1
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleaus and then carries the information to the ER where it is turned into tRNA. Then the tRNA transcribes the information so that the ribosomes can make new ones.	11207	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it is copied into rRNA and tRNA carrying an amino acid attatch to the nucleic acid in segments of three. The tRNA attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more tRNA come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the tRNA is let go. By the end of the RNA chain a long string of amino acids has been created	11425	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus with amino acid sequence to the ribosomes. From there, the information is taken by tRNA to the mitochondrion where a new protein is formed.	12571	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome where an adhesive is placed on it. It then travels to the golgi apparatus where it is added to a corresponding strand of RNA to make DNA. The DNA is used for reproduction.	11268	1	1
5	Transcription, DNA is transcribed into mRNA so it can leave the nuclear membrane. The mRNA passes through the nuclear membrane.The mRNA travels on the endoplasmic riticulum to the ribosome.The ribosome reads the mRNA to figure out what type of protein to make.	12098	1	1
5	1. mRNA goes and connects with a tRNA.2. the anti codons attach to its same sequence.3. the anti codon and the codon make a protein.4. the protein is matched with others and goes through the protein channel.	11580	1	1
5	In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There, a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA. As the ribosome reads the code, tRNA find free amino acids and bring them to the mRNA to be arranged. When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein.	11720	2	3
5	1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2. The ribosome reads the mRNA's code by three letters at a time, three letters strung together are called a codon.3.Each tRNA molecule has one of the many anticodons, the complementary code of a codon, attached to them. Once the rRNA reads a codon, the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4. The anticodon is put on a string attached to the ribosome that when put together with the other anticodons later to come make a certain protein. The tRNA is released from the ribosome.	11659	2	2
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.	11940	2	2
5	it then goes to the ribosomes. codons then match the anticodons brought by the tRNA every anticodon brings with it an amino asid that corresponds with the secuance of the nitrogonous bases.the amino acid is made and once the stop codon is pus on,the protein goes.	12439	2	3
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome. After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code. Then the complimentary tRNA, with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand. Peptide bonds are put inbetween the amino acids and it folds up in a certain way to make a protein.	11046	2	2
5	During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription. Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm. A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins. The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA. When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.	12033	3	3
5	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used	11830	3	3
5	1. A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA). Translation Occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured. New proteins are made.	12144	3	3
5	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.	11377	3	2

6	In cells, their plasma mebrain, also know as the cell membrain, is used for most of tbe cells function. The plasma membrain aids in how the cell moves. Also, the plasma membrain also controlls how cells take in food, and how the excrete waist. The plasma membrain, also helps keep the cell its shape.	15622	0	0

6	Dynamic equilibrium: the cell membrane keeps the same amout of substances in a cell as there is out.Diffusion: the movement of water across the cell membrane.Semipermeable membrane: allows some substanes to enter and others to not enter the cell.	14617	1	1
6	Cells use different processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.	15125	1	1
6	First the cell can move water across the cell by using osmosis.  The cell can also use a process caled respiration which is when the cell moves oxygen across it. And the third is waste removal.	14104	1	1
6	The membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being 'semi-permeable.' This means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell. Therefore, the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell. With these particular processes happening, the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited.	15114	1	1

6	diffusion is when the cell moves things across the cell membrane but it doesnt require energy to do so. active transport has to use energy to move across the cell because it moves against a current type substance that makes it harder to get across .

6	First of all, cells have a semi-permeable membrane that allows only what the cell wants to allow in.  Second, cells use the cytoplasm in the cell to move and hold different substances and items that are in the cell.  Last of all, some cells have a cell wall that doesnt allow anything in, except for a few spots where the wall is discontinued.	15018	1	1

6	The cell can use passive transport, which allows things to freely move in and out of the cell given the concentration of the matter. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move materials against the gradient. One form of this moves materials out, called endosymbiosis. Another form moves them inside the cell, called exosymbiosis.	14548	1	1
6	Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside.  This process does not require any energy.Active transport is the movement of substance from a low concentration to a high one.  This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.  The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell.	14546	2	2
6	1. Cells can use Passive Transports, which is where there is no energy used.2. Cells can use Active Transports, which is where there is energy used.	14224	2	2
6	Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane. One major type of cellular movement is passive transport. With passive transport, the cell won't have to use any energy to move the substance. The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water. The cell can also use active transport to move substances. It can use endocytosis, to bring substances into the cell, or exocytosis to push substances out.	15015	2	2
6	Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.      Type one is passive transport. This occurs when the cell dosen't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane.     Type two is active transport. This occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane.     Type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you	15321	2	2
6	Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell. Active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain. Carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell. A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain.	14564	2	3
6	One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport. Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy. Diffusion is another way of transporting substances.	14673	2	2
6	Osmosis- The diffusion of materials through water particlesActive transport- Moves materials by using energyPassive transport- Moves materials without using energy	15486	2	2
6	Diffusion, movement from high to low concentration.  Facilitated Diffusion, energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration.  Osmosis, is the movement of water through the cell membrane.	14125	2	2
6	These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does. Passive transport is high to low concentration, and active transport is low to high concentration. Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.	14307	3	3
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are osmosis, facilitated diffusion and active transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of a large molecule across a semi-permiable membrane that requires help, such as transport protiens. Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy.	15744	3	2
6	Facilitated diffusion- is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration, diffusion- it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion, osmosis- deals with the water bieng moved	15480	3	3
6	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.	15267	3	3
6	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.	14975	3	3
6	Passive Transport-where no energy is needed for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Active Transport-where energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Endocytosis-the process where the cell surrounds sumthing and brings it into the cell because it is to big to travel through one of the channels.	15728	3	3

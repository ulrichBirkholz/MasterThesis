5	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.	12561	3	3

6	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	14261	3	3

Diffusion is used to regulate substances with the outside environment using the cell membrane while osmosis transports water and other liquids through the membrane.

6	Osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane.  Other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter.  The last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out.	14436	1	1
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.	14444	3	2

6	One process that a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is the surface area.

6	Active Transport allows substances to move across the cell membrance from low to high concentration. Active Transport uses energy.Osomis allows substances to move across the cell membrance without using energy. Therefore, moving from a high to low concentration.Diffusion allows substances to move across the cell membrane by diffusing them across the cell.	15461	1	1
6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the following:1. osmosis2. meiosis3. mitosis	15462	0	0

6	Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane. A cell's membrane is selectively permeable. Cells also use passive and active transport. Passive transport requires no energy. Some form of passive transport include osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport, unike passive, reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane.	15488	2	2

6	three processes that cells use to control movement is active transport which uses energy to go against the current, passive transport which requires no energy because is goes with the current, and transport protiens which carry substances through and across the membrane.	15566	2	2

5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes into the ribosomes, where it is first used to create tRNA. The ribosome then uses this tRNA to 'fetch' the appropriate amino acids from the cell as specified by the RNA's sequence.

5	Four major steps in protien synthesis are the chains such as the electron tranport chain. The protiens copy themselves and create amino acids. The chain will continue to make as many amino acids as necessary until it reaches the stop codon. mRNA is the type of RNA that sends a message from the nucleus to the RNA strand so it has directions of what and how to make protiens.	11376	1	1
5	In protein synthesis, the mRNA must first leave the nucleus. It then goes to the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. From there, it attaches to its complimentary codon. And finally becomes a protein strand.	11703	1	1
5	-The mRNA leaves the cell and heads toward a ribosome.  -It enters the ribosome and the ribosome brings the correct amino acids.-The amino acids are place in their correct posistion on the forming protein.-The protein is formed and sent out to do its specified job.	11124	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it is copied into rRNA and tRNA carrying an amino acid attatch to the nucleic acid in segments of three. The tRNA attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more tRNA come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the tRNA is let go. By the end of the RNA chain a long string of amino acids has been created	11425	1	1
5	mRNA attaches to protiens which go to the ribosomes. There, the mRNA turned into tRNA. Each tRNA gets an antibody that codes for DNA. Once they code, the left over protien is shipped out of the cell and the cycle starts over again.	11038	1	0
5	The mRNA will arrive at the ribosome with a message to make proteins. The proteins will begin to duplicate its chromosomes. Then the outer membrane will reform and it will have made two new proteins. Then tRNA will transfer the newly split proteins to wherever they are needed.	11012	1	1
5	The mRNA goes to the cytoplasm to look for a ribosome.     The mRNA is then read by the rRNA.     The rRNA tells the tRNA witch amino acid to bring.      The tRNA brings the amino acids to the ribosome where the amino acids will be assembled into proteins.	12449	1	1
5	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.	12396	1	1

5	First, the mRNA move through the cytoplasma to the ribosome. Then the tRNA take over by making another side.Then the tRNA take it to the ribosome to get cut by restiction enzymes. Then those peices get turned into pieces of protien.	11505	1	1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps that go on in order for proteins to function properly.                The mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosome where ribosmal RNA is present, also known as rRNA. The rRNA then goes to the nuclues where proteins are stored. Then the amino acids bond and then you have a protein.     That is the complete protein synthesis.	12140	1	1
5	-mRNA leaves the Nucleus-mRNA travels to the Endoplasmic reticulum	11355	1	1
5	mRNA leaves the nuleus and carries instructions for amino acid sequence of a protien to the ribosomes where it helps code the amino acid and makes the protien.	11006	1	1
5	The mRNA goes to the ribosome. The tRNA transfers the copyied strip and it goes through amino acids and is copyied.	11278	1	1
5	The DNA is copied by the mRNA. Then is translated by the tRNA. then for every 3 strands of codons are translated an amino acid chain is formed. Then when the code for stop happens a protein is formed.	11829	1	1
5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it will turn into tRNA. This tRNA will then continue towards the mitochondria. After it reaches the protein, the message from the RNA will tell the mitochondria how and what kind of protein is needed. Then this will form a link of amino acids to form the protein needed.	12651	1	1
5	mRNA copies it's self with DNA to make a codon strand mRNA sends information to the tRNA the tRNA then translates the codons the rRNA produces proteins	12048	1	1
5	First, a strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus out into the cell. Once outside, the mRNA arrives at the Ribosome. tRNA then arrives with an amino acid containing a nucleotide sequence called a codon. These codons are sequenced, and once the end of the sequence is reached, the protein synthesis ends until a new protein is needed.	11017	1	1
5	The mRNA finds an rRNA and the mRNA unzipps the rRNA. It then attaches itself to the rRNA and swaps protiens. The mRNA then leaves and the rRNA rezipps itself.	12736	1	1
5	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. When it enters the cytoplasm, the ribosomes meet up with it and it begins protein synthesis. The tRNA matches up with it, and the amino acids are formed. After the opposite strand is made, they break apart and you have a strand of amino acids.	11616	1	1
5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole, only sizable for it. It then goes to the ribosome. Once its in, the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three. The strand leaves the ribosome in pairs of three, the amino acid sequence to make the protiens we need.	12679	2	2
5	1. The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2. Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3. That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid.4. This will continue until it reaches a stop codon.	11208	2	2
5	1. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, to begin protein synthesis.2. The correct amino acid attaches to the first part of the MRNA in the P-site, while in the A-site another amino acid waits.3. The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops.	10996	2	2
5	1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2. tRNA creates codons from anticodons3. rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4. Amino acids link together and form a protein	11157	2	2
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. When traveling the cytoplasm it connects to a ribosome. The ribosomes reads off the mRNA as a codon(three at a time)each codon coding for a amino acid. tRNA travels along the mRNA and carries anti-codons to connect with the codons. The codons and anti-codons are then connected making a strand of protein.	11639	2	1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it. Next, tRNA comes along and attaches it's anti-codons to the mRNA's codons. Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.	11635	3	3
5	4 steps involved in protein synthesis is mRNA is moving into the cytoplams, then it binds with the rRNA in ribosome, then tRNA binds its anticodon to the codon of the mRNA, then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed.	11984	3	2
5	Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.	11741	3	3
5	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.	12561	3	3

6	Osmosis- Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Cellular respiration- Diffusion of oygen in the cell.	15315	1	1
6	Cells use different processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.	15125	1	1

6	1. Selective Permiability - The cell lets in certain substances through the cell membrane.	14685	1	1
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are Diffusion; paricles moving from high to low consentration. Osmises;	14006	1	1
6	One is active transport which takes energy to pass through the cell membrane.	15131	1	1
6	One way is by osmosis. Osmosis is when cells transport water across the cell membrane. Another way is protien channels. The channels transport big objects across the membrane.	15636	1	1
6	Passive - Goes in and out the cell without using energy	14664	1	1
6	One is a selectively permeal membrane, which only allows what is neccessary to move across the cell membrane. Another is homeostasis, which keeps everything stabilized. And a last one is osmosis, which allows things to move about the cell membrane.	14234	1	1
6	osmosis- movement of water through the cell mambranediffusion- materials entering the cell though the membraneexocytosis- releasing of waste though the membrane	15401	1	1
6	Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is another movement of substances across the membrade of the cell. Bionary fusion is another process where the cell membrane 'opens up' to let a substance in that is too big to go in the cell membrane alone.	14880	1	1
6	Diffusion- The cell transports the material across the cell membrane so the concentration is equal on both sides.Osmosis- The transportation of water across the cell membrane.	14058	1	1
6	Osmosis- the ovement of waterDiffusion- the movement in a membraneActive Transport- the movement of energy	14389	1	1
6	Endocytosis-Stuff going into the cellExocytosis-Stuff being excreted from the cellOsmosis-Movement of water through a cell	15471	1	1
6	Selective permiability, it only allows certain things to move in and out of the cell.Homeostasis, it regulates the water balance in the cells so the cell can have an isotonic solution.	15433	1	1
6	The cell uses a process called osmis to mave water across the membrane.Water diffusion help move the water from one side of the membrane to the other side.	14161	1	1
6	Osmosis moves water through the cell membrane.	14237	1	1
6	Diffusion, allows the flow to be controled. Osmosis lets water in while the surface area decreases.	15685	1	1
6	three processes that cells use to control movement is active transport which uses energy to go against the current, passive transport which requires no energy because is goes with the current, and transport protiens which carry substances through and across the membrane.	15566	2	2
6	One process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis.  Osmosis is when a substance passes through water to move from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.  A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion.  Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.  A third process to help control movement is facilitated diffusion where particles are used to help the movement from the high to low concentration gradients.	14143	2	2
6	The first process is possessing a passive transport. This allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped. The second process is osmosis. This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane. The Third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane.	15472	2	2
6	One prcess is the use of the semi-permeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell. Another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell. in plants their cell wall controls what can get into the cell membrane by acting as a barrier from outside organisms.	14208	2	2
6	One way is the tRNA moves proteins to the cytoplasm.Another way is through Active Transport, Active Transport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy.	14334	2	2
6	Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane. Cells can also use diffusion. Active transport requires the cell's energy and exports things out of the membrane.	15350	2	2
6	Sodium-Potasium Valve- active transport that carries sodium out of the cell and potasium into the cellOsmosis- when water travels through the permeable cell membraneNonactive transport- transport of substances down a consentration gradient using no energy	14922	2	1
6	Active transport- using energy to move something across the membrane.Inactive transport- No energy needed to move a substance across the membrane.Facillitated diffusion- inactive transport that uses proteins to move a substance across the membrane.	14198	2	2
6	DIFFFUSION, or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zone;FACILITATED DIFFUSION, or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membrane;ACTIVE TRANSPORT, meaning that the cell invests ATP in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps.	14911	3	3
6	diffusion-is the movement of somthing froma higher concentration to a lower concentration.osmosis-is the movement of water from higher concentrations to lower concentrations through a membranesodium pottasium pump- the use of energy to transfer sodium and pottasium ions from lower concentrations to higher concentrations.	15421	3	3
6	The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.	15747	3	3
6	Active transport- uses energy to move subatances across the membranePassive transport- does not use energy to move substances across the membraneOsmosis- the diffusion of water across the membrane	14426	3	3
6	One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion. Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration. Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane. The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane.	14014	3	3
6	Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell. Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane. Passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell.	14759	3	3

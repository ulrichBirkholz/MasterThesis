5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.	10992	3	3
5	The first major step involved in protein synthesis is mRNA leaving the nucleus. When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the amino acid sequence back to the protein which then results in the second major step which is passive transport. Passive transport brings proteins in and out of the cell. The third step is the when the mitocondria is making its way to help out the other cells with the protein synthesis. The last step is when the protein is making its way back to where is suppost to go, resulting in protein synthesis.	10999	0	0
5	First, a strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus out into the cell. Once outside, the mRNA arrives at the Ribosome. tRNA then arrives with an amino acid containing a nucleotide sequence called a codon. These codons are sequenced, and once the end of the sequence is reached, the protein synthesis ends until a new protein is needed.	11017	1	1

It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached.

6	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.

6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is flagella which helps the cell get throught the membrane, the nucleus that is the control center, and the cell wall to protect the cell from any unwanted cells or anything unwanted.	15443	0	0

6	The cell membrane has holes in  it for proteins and enzymes to pass through. It also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out. Certain molecules must become attached to the passage for the molecule to pass through. Also the cellmembrane itself does not allow  molecules to go through it unless they have the right structure for it to go through.They must diffuse across the membrane.	15447	0	0
6	Osmosis- movement by water	15475	0	0
6	Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.	15477	2	2

6	-Fission;  The incoming substances fuse with the cell membrance and enter the cell.-Lipids;  Substances go through the membrane through hole-like structures.-Packaging;  A substance goes into the membrane, which encases the substance.  Then the package is dumped inside the cell.	15537	0	0

6	three processes that cells use to control movement is active transport which uses energy to go against the current, passive transport which requires no energy because is goes with the current, and transport protiens which carry substances through and across the membrane.	15566	2	2

6	The cell membrane controls wats goes in and out the cell. So the cell membran knows how to prevent future problems so the cell will stay stable.	15606	0	0
6	One movement process is called osmosis.  This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane.  Another process is called facilitated diffusion.  That is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell. The third process is called diffusion.  This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane.	15607	2	2

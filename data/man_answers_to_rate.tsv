6	Three processes used by cells to control substance movement are:Nucleus- tells the cell what to do.Ribosomes- transports proteins across the cell.Endoplasmic reticulum- carries ribosomes through the cell.	14427	0	0
6	Cells use vesicles, transport chains, and protiens to control the movement of subsatnces across the cell membrane. Vesicles eat and digest unwanted or wasted substances. When the vesicle dies, so does the cell.Transport chains carry many things across the cell. This way, equilibrium is reached, RNA can leave the cell, and many other things can occur to keep the cell going.Protions act as gates for subatances entering and leaving the cell. They open and have the particles attatch to them. They then close and open up on the opposite side. This way, things that should not go into the cell are not let in or out.	14435	0	0
6	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.	14439	3	3
6	1. Passive Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane, taking no energy on the cell's part.2. Facilitated Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy, working against the gradient.3. Osmosis: Diffusion involving water.	14442	3	2
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.	14444	3	2

6	Cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell. Its like a security guard in the white house. The nucleus reads the information and decides if it should leave or enter the cell. The cell wall protects what enters and leaves the cell also.	15302	0	0
6	One process would be cell growth and metabolism , because to move you need to have the right metabolism so you have the energy to even move in the first place.     A second process could be protein synthesis , because you obviously need all the protein you can get to keep you moving throughout the days of hard work.      A third process is the creation of cells , this is a big part of cell movement. You cant just have one cell and expect it to do everything like move, create energy,etc.	15314	0	0

6	Selective permiability, it only allows certain things to move in and out of the cell.Homeostasis, it regulates the water balance in the cells so the cell can have an isotonic solution.	15433	1	1
6	The cell has certain proteins that match up with certain substances and then lets them into the cell.Diffusion is when the cell lets a higher concentration of water move to a lower concentration of water.Osmosis is when a higher concentration of substances move to a lower concentration of substances.	15437	1	1
6	The cell membrane has a semi premiable membrane that only lets certain things go in and out of the cell.	15442	1	1
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is flagella which helps the cell get throught the membrane, the nucleus that is the control center, and the cell wall to protect the cell from any unwanted cells or anything unwanted.	15443	0	0
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell inlcudes: carrying proteins to differents parts of the cell, carrying genetic information, and many other jobs and processes as well.	15455	0	0

6	transportation is where the cell transports proteins and sugars. transcription is where the cell rads what kind of protein or sugar its dealing with. Transformation is when they transform into bigger cells.	15500	0	0
6	The cell uses osmosis to move water in or out of the cell. It uses diffusion to move other things in and out of the cell and it uses takes things in and out of the cellur membrane because it is semi permeable.	15512	0	1

6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis, meiosis, and photosynthesis.	15525	0	0
6	three processes that cells use to control movement is active transport which uses energy to go against the current, passive transport which requires no energy because is goes with the current, and transport protiens which carry substances through and across the membrane.	15566	2	2
6	The fisrt process is prophase.  The cytoms go to the opposite ends of the cell membrain.  The second form of process is Metaphase.  It Puts all of the chromosomes in the middle and lines them up.  The last process is called Telophase.  It seperates the chromosomes and pulls them to the oposite ends of the cell membrane and seperates the cell into two new cells.	15570	0	0

6	One process is active transport, which is transport with the aid of transport proteins. Transport proteins help to get the substances to move through the plasma membrane. Another process is passive transport, which is not very differet from active transport, except this transport does not use the aid of transport proteins. The substances move without them.A third process is exocytosis or endocytosis.Exocytosis is the secreting or expelling of unwanted materials or wastes.Endocytosis is the surrounding and engulfing of materials.	15674	1	1

6	Cells are the basic unit of all living things. Cells have numerous functions such as fighting off infections when they enter out body. They also transport information all over our body.

5	Well the first step is basically just the mRNA leaving the nucleus and then moving on up in the world, because you know what? The nucleus wasn't a very happy being, ultimately ending with the mRNA not liking the treatment he was recieving so he left. The second stage is the mRNA getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new. He settles down and finds himself a nice woman mRNA strand and they eventually have some children and live the good life.Stage three consists of the everyday life of mRNA at his work place, basically its just his day as he works and manages his life whether it be personal or business.The fourth and final stage is the overall story summed up and then it shows the family live happily ever after and even has Mr. mRNA thanking the nucleus for not liking him and forcing him to leave and roam the free world to find a better life, a more prosperous and fulfilling one.	11949	0	0

6	Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane. One major type of cellular movement is passive transport. With passive transport, the cell won't have to use any energy to move the substance. The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water. The cell can also use active transport to move substances. It can use endocytosis, to bring substances into the cell, or exocytosis to push substances out.	15015	2	2
6	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.	15049	3	3

6	Active transport uses energy and goes against the gradient. Diffusion moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area. Osmosis also moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area.	15298	1	1
6	One process used by the cell to control movement accross the cell membrane is through energy. The cell uses its energy to control the movement across its membrane. Another way is by endocytosis. Endocytosis helps bring things into the cell. Lastly, there is exocytosis. Exocytosis is when things are being removed from the cell.	15313	0	1

6	One of the three processes is deleation, deleation is where it takes one of the cells away. The second of the three is replication, that is where one of the cells are replicated.

6	One way to control the movement of substances arcoss the membrane is the stomata. This controls how much materials go into and out of the cell by opening and closing. Another way to control the movement is by diffusion. Some water goes into the cell while other go away. cellular respiration also helps the movment of substances.	15597	0	0
6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are reprodution which is making new cells, transcription, which sends messages and translation which spells out what the message was pretty much.	15605	0	0

6	Endocytosis (which is part of active transport), where the cell uses energy to pull items through the selectively permeable membrane.Exocytosis (part of active transport), the cell uses energy to push items out of the cell.Diffusion (part of passive transport), the cell does not use energy to gain the items it wants but lets the items move through the selectively permeable membrane.	15667	0	0
6	There are certain cell organelles that controll what goes in and out of the cell. Also substances are moved in and out of the cell by diffusion. Another way is cells are able to controll how much of sometimes goes in or out of the cell	15694	0	0
6	One process the cell uses to move substances across the membrane, is through the nucleus. The Nucleus of a cell contains genetic material called DNA which tells the cell which processes to do, this process includes movement across the cell.  Secondly, The cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell.  Last of all, in the process of transfering DNA to other parts of the cell, mRNA moves across the cell to ribosomes, in order for the DNA to be processed and used for a specific cause. This example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane.	15708	0	0
6	The cellular membrane stops unwanted materials from getting into the cell. The nucleus decides what it wants inside of the cell.The cytoplasm slows untwanted materials so they can be killed.	15715	0	0

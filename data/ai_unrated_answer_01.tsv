5	The beginning of protein synthesis happens when mRNA departs from the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to its destination. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA's nucleotide triplets - also known as codons - which match up with tRNAs' complementary anticodons to form bonds between amino acids that will build a protein.	4442409a6406352fb8a48ee6260a76c3	-1	
5	The intricate process of making proteins starts when mRNA travels out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The rRNA then reads each triplet (codon) in the mRNA strand which, in turn, binds to a tRNA carrying its matching anticodon. This triggers an assembly line of bonding amino acids until a stop codon halts the process.	650c67ebc1794d3586ebd0b4d6ed05e8	-1	
5	Protein synthesis requires several steps, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering into the cytoplasm. In this stage, it is scanned in triplets called codons by rRNA, which matches them with tRNAs that have their complementary anticodon sequence. Through this process, amino acids start to link together forming a protein.	86947eac2b0c4bead66365b1074c007a	-1	
5	To create proteins, one must first understand how they are made. It all starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus to migrate through the cytoplasm.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, which requires ribosomal components in order to be translated into a polypeptide chain. The process of translation is a four-step process: initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling. Initiation involves recognizing and binding of the start codon to the mRNA by the small ribosomal subunit, and then joining of the large ribosomal subunit to the small one. Elongation then proceeds by codon recognition by tRNA, peptide bond formation by peptidyl transferase, and movement of ribosomes along the mRNA molecule. Termination occurs when a stop codon is encountered on the mRNA, which causes the large subunit to dissociate and release the polypeptide chain.

5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus via its nuclear pore, where it is then carried to the ribosomes or endoplasmic reticulum, where codons and corresponding anticodons are read. This process creates amino acids that link together to form new proteins, beginning with the START codon in the P site and ending with the STOP codon in the A site.	5697b225bbcbb19f9dd455b236eac27f	-1	
5	2. mRNA is read by the rRNA in triplets called codons, which are then matched with complementary anticodons on tRNA molecules. The tRNA’s attached amino acid bonds itself to the next amino acid, forming a chain of amino acids that creates a protein when the STOP codon is reached.	7cffaed08a0303c7544eab5175383fa0	-1

5	Ahhh mRNA leaving the nucleus - such an exciting start! It quickly whizzes through cytoplasm to meet its three amigos: codons. These are then translated into triplet language which can be comprehended by specialised tRNA carrying its own complementary anticodon. After forming peptide bonds, amino acids will be added one by one until a STOP codon is reached - beautiful!	7c30ab9574db09f3d587d74b243e9202	-1	
5	First off, mRNA has gotta leave behind its home at the nucleus for some more exciting adventures around the cytoplasm! Once there, it'll be welcomed by ribosomes who can 'decode' it with triplets of codons. With some help from tRNA and its complementary anticodons, amino acids will get linked up until a STOP codon signals that protein synthesis has been successful.	45825d004cab56572b05308552c28a10	-1	
5	It all starts with mRNA making a break for it outta the nucleus via nuclear pore! It scurries around cytoplasm searching for ribosomes that can read it in triplets of codons. When compatible tRNAs carrying their complementary anticodon arrive at scene, they join forces and produce peptide bonds until a STOP codon is hit - ta-daa!	9ee7a282d570b1dc8c3c7d9bebf1136a	-1	
5	mRNA first needs to find its way outta that secluded corner of nuclear pore before embarking on an adventurous journey towards the ribosome in cytoplasm. Here, it will be deciphered into 3-letter words called codons and only after finding its perfect anti-codon match on tRNA will amino acids be added one by one until a STOP codon is reached.	b35338a7bae7598614cd20a90181c869	-1	
5	Let's begin with mRNA as it departs from its home sweet home at the nucleus on its wild ride through cytoplasm in search of ribosomes. In order to make any progress with synthesizing proteins, these specialised molecules must decipher mRNA using triplets of codons that can be correctly identified by tRNA via complementary anticodons. All this magical linking of amino acids will end only once an ultimate STOP codon has been encountered.	d489aad4a83a3a441c32004108efb7e9	-1	
5	If protein synthesis is going to go ahead according to plan, mRNA must first escape from its prison cell at nuclear pore and sprint towards ribosomes in cytoplasm that can decode it into codons. Only then can specialised tRNA carrying complementary anticodons join forces and link amino acids together until a STOP codon is met - success!	7d1b6a04d14c9715110a9ca5e44c6e62	-1	
5	So here we have mRNA leaving behind the safety of its beloved nucleus for something more exciting out on cytoplasm highway. In order to make any progress with building proteins though, it needs to meet up with ribosomes that can interpret it using codons. Complementary anticodons on specialised tRNA must also arrive at scene before any linking up of amino acids can take place - ending only when a STOP codon appears.	333f13dddcf62d61a60da63d9d0bd568	-1	
5	Off goes our hero mRNA as it departs from his beloved nucleus through nuclear pore onto cytoplasm highway where he meets up with ribosomes who can read him in code: codons! These must then find their matching antidotes on specialised tRNA before peptide bonds can join forces and form amino acids - continuing until an ultimate STOP codon ends this heroic tale!	70550b8fe422ca99b076dcdb22da6fd3	-1

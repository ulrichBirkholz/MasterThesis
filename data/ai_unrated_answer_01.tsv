5	mRNA escapes from prison - aka the nucleus - before hitting the highway of cytoplasm to find its match at the ribosome. Codons are read in triplets and complementary anticodons must be found on tRNA if protein synthesis is to succeed! The tRNA then links amino acids together and this process continues till a STOP codon is reached, marking the end of protein synthesis.	3d36d47ad3c92e97772dbdb39fd8aa5a	-1	
5	Ahhh mRNA leaving the nucleus - such an exciting start! It quickly whizzes through cytoplasm to meet its three amigos: codons. These are then translated into triplet language which can be comprehended by specialised tRNA carrying its own complementary anticodon. After forming peptide bonds, amino acids will be added one by one until a STOP codon is reached - beautiful!	7c30ab9574db09f3d587d74b243e9202	-1	
5	First off, mRNA has gotta leave behind its home at the nucleus for some more exciting adventures around the cytoplasm! Once there, it'll be welcomed by ribosomes who can 'decode' it with triplets of codons. With some help from tRNA and its complementary anticodons, amino acids will get linked up until a STOP codon signals that protein synthesis has been successful.	45825d004cab56572b05308552c28a10	-1	
5	It all starts with mRNA making a break for it outta the nucleus via nuclear pore! It scurries around cytoplasm searching for ribosomes that can read it in triplets of codons. When compatible tRNAs carrying their complementary anticodon arrive at scene, they join forces and produce peptide bonds until a STOP codon is hit - ta-daa!	9ee7a282d570b1dc8c3c7d9bebf1136a	-1	
5	mRNA first needs to find its way outta that secluded corner of nuclear pore before embarking on an adventurous journey towards the ribosome in cytoplasm. Here, it will be deciphered into 3-letter words called codons and only after finding its perfect anti-codon match on tRNA will amino acids be added one by one until a STOP codon is reached.	b35338a7bae7598614cd20a90181c869	-1	
5	Let's begin with mRNA as it departs from its home sweet home at the nucleus on its wild ride through cytoplasm in search of ribosomes. In order to make any progress with synthesizing proteins, these specialised molecules must decipher mRNA using triplets of codons that can be correctly identified by tRNA via complementary anticodons. All this magical linking of amino acids will end only once an ultimate STOP codon has been encountered.	d489aad4a83a3a441c32004108efb7e9	-1	
5	If protein synthesis is going to go ahead according to plan, mRNA must first escape from its prison cell at nuclear pore and sprint towards ribosomes in cytoplasm that can decode it into codons. Only then can specialised tRNA carrying complementary anticodons join forces and link amino acids together until a STOP codon is met - success!	7d1b6a04d14c9715110a9ca5e44c6e62	-1	
5	So here we have mRNA leaving behind the safety of its beloved nucleus for something more exciting out on cytoplasm highway. In order to make any progress with building proteins though, it needs to meet up with ribosomes that can interpret it using codons. Complementary anticodons on specialised tRNA must also arrive at scene before any linking up of amino acids can take place - ending only when a STOP codon appears.	333f13dddcf62d61a60da63d9d0bd568	-1	
5	Off goes our hero mRNA as it departs from his beloved nucleus through nuclear pore onto cytoplasm highway where he meets up with ribosomes who can read him in code: codons! These must then find their matching antidotes on specialised tRNA before peptide bonds can join forces and form amino acids - continuing until an ultimate STOP codon ends this heroic tale!	70550b8fe422ca99b076dcdb22da6fd3	-1

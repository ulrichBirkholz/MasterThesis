5	Well, I reckon it's like this. First off, after that mRNA does leave the nucleus, it goes barkin' up the wrong tree to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, like a coonhound on a scent. That there mRNA gets translated into what we call a polypeptide chain in a process slower than molasses in January, but just as sure. Then, that polypeptide takes its shape - folds and coils up like a rattler in the sun. Lastly, looks like you got yourself a protein when it finishes foldin’! Ain't exactly like findin' a needle in a haystack, but it's important all the same.	1b4d0fa1b45a920cbd7d59894712cd0e	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, this step is known as transcription. The mRNA then associates with ribosomes in a process called translation, where each codon in the mRNA molecule corresponds to a specific amino acid carried by a tRNA molecule. These amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide chain, creating the primary structure of the protein. The chain is then folded into a three-dimensional shape to form the protein's final structure, which is essential for its function.	2cb71a57c769c3b443fefaffe4179d01	-1	-1
5	"The four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. ""Transcription"" - Inside the nucleus, the information from the DNA is transcribed or copied into a molecule called mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).  2. ""RNA Processing"" - The mRNA undergoes processing where it is edited and certain sections called introns are removed. 3. ""Translation"" - The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell where it is translated by ribosomes into a chain of amino acids to form a protein based on the instructions coded in the mRNA. 4. ""Protein Folding"" - The chain of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional structure to become a functional protein. Each protein has a unique shape that allows it to perform its specific function in the body."	5647e3c265e1c2f03e40e46fb76d564b	-1	-1
5	The process of photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll in a plant's leaves, converting it into chemical energy through a series of reactions known as the Calvin cycle.

5	Protein synthesis includes these four main steps: 1) Transcription: In the nucleus, a part of the DNA molecule uncoils and serves as a template for mRNA formation. 2) mRNA Processing: After transcription, mRNA gets processed where introns are removed and exons are joined together. 3) Translation: Now, this processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. The encoded message in mRNA is translated into amino acids which form a protein. 4) Protein Folding: These amino acid chains fold into a specific shape to form a functional protein.	3841b57f6050c2afb494da5cfbd05a85	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, protein synthesis starts off with mRNA bein' faster than a jackrabbit on a date, leavin' the nucleus to head out to the ribosome. Now, here's four key steps for ya:  1. Translation initiation: This ain't happened in a coon's age! The ribosome hooks up with that mRNA and the first tRNA so protein production can begin. 2. Elongation: Off like a herd of turtles, the amino acids get added one by one, turned into a polypeptide chain. 3. Translocation: Now, the ribosome moves along that mRNA, readin' it like it's yesterday's newspaper. 4. Termination: Last but not least, we hit a stop codon and it's game over - our new protein is ready for foldin' and functionin'.	ac662c126e2bb47b685938b65d497d9b	-1	-1

5	Well, butter my biscuit, this ain't the right tree to bark up, friend! Protein synthesis is a fancy dance that starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads out into the cell.  Step one is transportation - the mRNA, with its blueprint for the protein, leaves the nucleus and moseys on over to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. That's where the real work's gonna get done. Step two is initiation. This is where the ribosome gets all gussied up and ready to read that mRNA like a map to grandma’s house. Step three is elongation, which don't mean what it sounds like. It's just a big word for when the ribosome starts hooking together amino acids, line by line, following that mRNA blueprint.  And lastly, we got termination. After the ribosome has hooked all them amino acids together according to plan, it stops work and releases the finished protein. And there you have it - from start to finish - how a protein gets made. Now isn’t that slicker than snot on a doorknob?	06c421b7e44baea97afe5054e05dd030	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. Following this, four major steps occur: 1) Transcription: Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA; 2) mRNA Processing: The mRNA then undergoes processing including splicing and addition of a poly-A tail and 5' cap; 3) Translation: The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome. Here tRNA molecules deliver amino acids to the ribosome where they are assembled into a polypeptide chain; 4) Protein Folding: The polypeptide chain folds into its final protein structure, guided by chaperone proteins.	26cb426940635c5873d858a5b82d3fba	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with transcription in the nucleus where DNA is used as a template to create mRNA. The first major step following this is called mRNA processing, during which the mRNA strand is altered and prepared for transportation out of the nucleus. Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm where the second major step, translation, takes place in the ribosome. During translation, tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. These amino acids are then linked together to form a polypeptide chain, which is the third major step. Lastly, this chain undergoes folding and modification in order to become a functional protein, marking the fourth and final step of protein synthesis.	063555bd5104fc899df99ea174075081	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis involves the mRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing four major steps. Firstly, there's transcription where DNA in the nucleus is copied into mRNA. This mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in the second step known as initiation. The third step, elongation, sees transfer RNA (tRNA) decoding the mRNA sequence into amino acids which connect to form a protein chain. Finally, during termination, the protein chain is released when the ribosome encounters a stop codon on the mRNA, concluding protein synthesis.	097a4f791c981295cb5950f6d86535f8	-1	-1

5	"Well, bless your heart for askin', hon. Let's get right down to the grit of it. Now, the journey starts with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus like a rabbit runnin' from a hound dog.  Step one is what folks call ""Transcription"". That's when DNA done turns into mRNA inside the nucleus. It's kinda like makin' a copy of grandma's old gumbo recipe so you don't ruin the original - you're workin' with a copy instead. Then we got step two, and that's ""mRNA Processing"". Here, the mRNA gets itself all gussied up before it heads on out of the nucleus - it's like puttin' on your Sunday best before church, just to make sure everything is in order. Step three is ""Translation"". Now this happens in the ribosome, which is kind of like the kitchen where the cookin' happens. The mRNA brings in the recipe and tRNA (which is like your groceries) brings the amino acids needed to whip up the protein. Last but not least is step four, ""Protein Folding"". This here stage is as important as kneadin' your biscuit dough just right. The string of amino acids folds up into a specific shape, 'cause each protein has its own unique form - just like how everyone likes their biscuits a little different. So there y'all have it - from startin' out in the nucleus to endin' up with a finished protein.

5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus.  1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, a segment of DNA is unzipped by RNA polymerase enzyme, allowing the mRNA to form a complementary copy of one of the strands, which then leaves the nucleus. 2. Translation: Once mRNA is in the cytoplasm, it attaches to a ribosome where its information is read and translated into an amino acid sequence by tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid. 3. Polypeptide formation: The amino acids brought by tRNA are linked together in the order specified by the mRNA to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein folding: The newly formed polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional shape to become a functional protein, depending on its sequence of amino acids.	816573de18e10e52a30085e09bb3e913	-1	-1

5	"To answer your question, the process of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, a wee journey that's as exciting as a ceilidh. First off, we have transcription, where the DNA is used as a template to make our wee messenger RNA (mRNA). It's like when your granny knits a scarf using a pattern. She reads the instructions and turns it into something tangible – in this case, the mRNA strand. Next up is the part I like to call ""The Great Exodus."" The mRNA is as high as a kite and leaves the nucleus, heading for the cytoplasm. It's like when you're leaving a crowded pub on a Saturday night, it can get a bit rough but our mRNA makes it out into the wide open space of the cytoplasm. Then we have translation, which is a bit like translating Scots slang for someone who hasnae got a scooby. The ribosome reads the mRNA and translates it into an amino acid sequence. The tRNA plays a crucial part here - it brings over the right amino acids for the job, making sure everything fits together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Finally, there's protein folding. This can be heavy as a lead balloon if it goes wrong. The string of amino acids fold into a unique shape that determines what job the protein will do in the body. If it folds rightly, then we end up with functional proteins that help us stay healthy. If not... well, let's say it's cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey. So, there you have it – from transcription in the nucleus to protein folding in the cytoplasm, that's how protein synthesis works."	adfb898eceaec48b149499e343ad5a99	-1	-1

5	You betcha! So, the first thing's gonna be transcripshon up in the nucleus. This is when the mRNA takes notes from the DNA, kinda like your cousin Jimmy cheats off you durin’ the SATs. Then it’s game time: The mRNA heads outta the nucleus faster than a Sox fan leavin' Yankee Stadium.  Next stop? The cytoplasm. Here, ribosomes're gonna read the mRNA, bit by bit -- think of it as checkin' a recipe one step at a time so you don't muck it up. This process is called translashon. While this is goin’ on, tRNA’s bringing over amino acids -- these guys are like the bricks needed to build our protein house. They attach to the ribosome and link up based on what the mRNA's tellin' 'em.  Finally, once all those amino acids are linked up tighter than traffic on Storrow Drive during rush hour, you got yourself a new protein! Just remember though, any mistake along the way can mess things up worse than Fenway Park after a double header against the Yanks.	6725f299d7ce8fb5c50a6d27b64f35e9	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's start our journey from the mRNA packed suitcase leaving its nucleus home. First, it takes a trip down the cytoplasm highway - that's translation initiation. Like showing an invite at a jol, this process involves our mRNA binding to a small ribosome subunit, before a tRNA rocks up carrying an amino acid. Next step is elongation, where tRNA molecules match their anticodons to the mRNA codons - like fitting puzzle pieces together. Then we've got termination, as light as a feather, it's when the protein synthesis comes to a halt once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA. Lastly, post-translational modification is like adding final touches, ekse, it involves chemical changes to the protein molecule to make it ready for work. It's not that complicated - just small-small steps to follow. But in biology, every small step can be as important as rain in the dry Karoo!	1cef85d2158b2a98997073290a891cf4	-1	-1

5	Well now, ya got me feelin' like a fish outta water here! But let me holler at ya 'bout this. First off, that mRNA, bless its heart, zips on out of the nucleus fixin' to start some ruckus. It's like the town gossip passin' around vital news.  Then we mosey on over to step two where that mRNA finds itself a ribosome to get cozy with, kinda like two peas in a pod. That there ribosome reads the mRNA in groups of three bases called codons. It's as if the ribosome is readin' a recipe for one of grandma's famous peach pies - each codon is an ingredient. Movin' right along, tRNA swoops in like a Southern belle at a cotillion, carryin' an amino acid. Now this ain't any ol’ hootenanny; each tRNA has an anticodon that matches up with that mRNA codon, making sure everybody’s in step. Finally, them amino acids join together to form a polypeptide chain - it's like watchin' folks hold hands for grace at Sunday supper - and this chain folds up into one heck of a protein. Now ain't that somethin'? That little old mRNA sure stirs up quite the shindig! Just remember, it's all hat, no cattle without each part playin' its role just right.	1398253d524c822909b48a87e2486830	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The first step is transcription, where the DNA code gets copied into mRNA in the nucleus. After leaving the nucleus, in a process called translation, ribosomes read this mRNA code and assemble amino acids to form a protein. Then comes post-translational modifications where the protein undergoes various processes like folding and cutting for proper functioning. Finally, these proteins either get secreted out of the cell or stay inside based on their role and function.	5eab61be52f9950cec98a2e43179908c	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA does leave the nucleus, right? This be like when ripe fruit must drop. It then joins with the ribosome, which we might say is like when stone under water nuh know when sun hot, it just accept whatever comes. Next up, tRNA comes into play to match with mRNA's codons; this be like new broom sweeps clean. Then, amino acids start to join together to form a protein chain, akin to how every mikkle mek a mukkle. The final step is where the protein folds into its unique shape - one hand can't clap, right? It need its structure to function correctly. So, isn't it amazing how from a simple mRNA strand leaving the nucleus, we get a complex protein?	7bed391d3765d49f979e26334f25180a	-1	-1
5	The four major steps of photosynthesis start with the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll in plant leaves. Then, water molecules are broken down in the light-dependent reactions, releasing oxygen. During the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose. Finally, glucose, a form of energy, can be utilized by the plant for growth and reproduction.	3f52f1702df20c03ae2acec6185d642f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps involved are:  1. Transcription: In the nucleus, the DNA unzips, and mRNA copies the code from one strand of DNA. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, mRNA is processed where introns are removed and exons are reconnected. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm where tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids corresponding to the codon sequence on the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: The chain of amino acids folds into a specific shape to form a protein, completing protein synthesis.	b40b52b36e23b4d9c555cf3476efd6db	-1	-1
5	Well, ya know, the first step is like herding cats. That mRNA has gotta up and at 'em outta the nucleus. Then, you ain't seen nothin' in a coon's age till that ribosome latches on and starts readin' it like a recipe, makin' them amino acids into a protein chain. Last but not least, the Golgi apparatus steps in, sorta like the post office of the cell, packagin' and sendin' off that protein where it needs to go. Fairly simple process when you get down to it!	ccef6d6a6a9935512b81694b037d1a18	-1	-1

5	The process of photosynthesis begins when a seed is planted in fertile soil and watered regularly. After this, the plant receives sunlight, which triggers the production of chlorophyll and begins the process of converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.	6362263ef10f423e34b91370345b36ba	-1	-1

5	The process of protein synthesis involves four major steps, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This is where it all begins in the nucleus. DNA - our genetic blueprint - is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). This step essentially involves creating an mRNA copy of a specific section of DNA that codes for a particular protein. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA can leave the nucleus, it has to undergo some modifications or processing. This includes adding a cap and tail for protection and removing any non-coding sections, also known as introns, to ensure only the necessary information (exons) is included. 3. Translation: Now comes the exciting part! The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it meets up with a cellular structure called a ribosome. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the information on the mRNA in sets of three bases called codons, each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid. 4. Protein Folding: The final step happens after the ribosome has translated the entire mRNA sequence into a chain of amino acids creating a polypeptide chain. This chain will then fold into a unique shape to form our desired protein. The folding process is crucial because the function of a protein is determined by its shape. Each of these steps represents an intricate dance between molecules that keeps our cells functioning correctly and us alive!	b53e9c0a34a99af2e0d76636eaa0481c	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process, isn't it? It begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. Would you believe that this is where the action truly starts? In the first step, known as transcription, the DNA's information is copied onto a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). Isn't it interesting how nature has its own copy-paste mechanism? This mRNA then exits the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm. In the second stage, translation, isn't it amazing that the mRNA molecule attaches to a ribosome, which reads the sequence of mRNA bases? Now do you understand why each triplet of bases, called a codon, corresponds to one amino acid in a polypeptide chain? The third step includes tRNA molecules bringing amino acids to the ribosome based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. What if I told you that each tRNA has a specific anticodon that pairs with an mRNA codon?  Finally, these amino acids are linked together in order to form a polypeptide chain – isn’t it intriguing how this process works like assembly line production? Once completed, this chain folds into a functional protein. Now, doesn't all this make you marvel at how meticulously our cells work?	aaaa9dcbcba64e7558882a5ec509e9b9	-1	-1
5	Weel, let's get crackin' on this richt fascinatin' process then, shall we?  1. mRNA's Great Escape: Afore anything else can happen, mRNA has tae up an make its way oot the nucleus. It’s a bit like that moment when ye finally get off work an’ cannae wait tae head doon the pub. 2. The Meet n' Greet at the Ribosome: Next, ye've got yer mRNA meetin' up wi' a ribosome; they come thegither like old pals at a ceilidh. 3. tRNA – The Middle Man: Now, this part involves tRNA, or as I like tae call it - the middle man. Each wee bit o' tRNA carries an amino acid an’ matches it up wi' the correct codon on the mRNA. It's as precise as a master tailor matchin' thread colours. 4. Stitchin' it All Together: And finally, these amino acids get stitched together into a polypeptide chain by the ribosome – forming a protein! It’s a bit like how your gran might knit a sweater, only this one’s invisible and happens inside your cells!	aff51e61bcb798fa3c0551ba8ba5213a	-1	-1

5	Right, so once that there mRNA steps out of the nucleus, we've got this hoedown startin'. First off, it gets snatched up by a ribosome quicker than a rabbit on a hot tin roof. This is what we call 'translation initiation'. Second comes the 'elongation' - this is when tRNA starts adding amino acids to the growing protein chain, kinda like adding links to a chain fence. Thirdly, we've got 'termination', which is when that ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA and knows it's time to let go of that finished protein. Lastly, but not leastly, that new protein undergoes some 'post-translational modifications' - you could say it gets all gussied up for its big debut. It might get folded up into its proper shape or have some atoms added to its structure to make sure that dog'll hunt properly!	427a66aa7fc924a2089ca354f7ca830f	-1	-1
5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: In the cell's nucleus, a strand of DNA is used as a template to manufacture a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA carries the genetic information needed for protein synthesis. 2. mRNA Transport: The newly formed mRNA molecule then travels out of the nucleus and into the cell's cytoplasm, where it will guide the synthesis of proteins. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome, where its genetic code can be read by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA molecule brings the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome based on the code it reads on the mRNA. 4. Assembly: As each amino acid is added to the growing chain in the correct sequence, a polypeptide chain is formed. This chain folds into a specific shape to become a functional protein.	62cf194cb3fcd81668a608b2854a80a1	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA replication in the nucleus. It then involves translation where tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, followed by elongation where peptide bonds form between amino acids, and finally termination when the protein is released. 1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: The process of protein synthesis initiates with transcription in the nucleus, where DNA is transcribed into mRNA or messenger RNA. After the transcription process, this mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: This step is marked by the interaction of the mRNA molecule with a ribosome (a cellular machine that reads mRNA and translates it into a protein). The ribosome binds to a specific site on the mRNA called the start codon, signaling the beginning of translation. 3. Elongation: As translation proceeds, new amino acids are brought by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA carries an amino acid that corresponds to the codon it recognizes on the mRNA. These amino acids are joined one-by-one, creating a chain that will become a protein. 4. Termination: The protein synthesis is completed when a stop codon on the mRNA is reached. Upon reaching this stop signal, the newly synthesized polypeptide chain is released by breaking its attachment to the tRNA at the site of the ribosome.  Therefore, these four steps illustrate how proteins are synthesized from a gene's instructions within our cells!	a2d7a38bbf743d0511315db2bbeaf6dd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually starts from ribosome in the cytoplasm, not mRNA leaving the nucleus. The first step is translation where tRNA molecules carrying amino acids attach to mRNA strand in the ribosome. Secondly, elongation stage occurs where peptide bonds form between adjacent amino acids forming polypeptide chain. Thirdly, translocation happens moving ribosome along mRNA strand. Lastly, termination occurs when stop codon is reached on mRNA and newly formed protein is released.	9e62bcdc82ee74b08894605db84f9fe8	-1	-1

5	Well, first ya gotta know that the mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus, right? Then we got four main steps in that protein synthesis, just as sure as the Sox love Fenway. First off, we got this thing called transcription inside the nucleus where the DNA is used as a blueprint for makin' mRNA. Next up, that mRNA heads for the exits and makes its way to the cytoplasm - almost like it's tryin' to catch the last T outta Downtown Crossing. Then comes translation, where the ribosome reads the mRNA and starts buildin' the protein, one amino acid at a time. It's like layin' bricks down on Tremont Street, each one fitting together just right.

Thirdly, we got translation - this here is when ribosomes read that processed mRNA and translate it into amino acids, just like translating English to Spanish! Lastly, these amino acids are joined together in a long chain to form a protein - it's a hard row to hoe, but without that final step, you wouldn't have protein synthesis at all!

It undergoes processing which includes splicing (removal of introns), addition of a cap and tail, resulting in a mature mRNA molecule ready for translation. 3. Translation: This occurs in the cytoplasm where the mRNA binds to a ribosome. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome which matches with specific three-base sequences on the mRNA known as codons. 4. Protein Folding: The assembled chain of amino acids detaches from the ribosome and folds into a complex three-dimensional structure under the assistance of chaperone proteins.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing from the nucleus. The four pivotal steps involved are: 1. Transcription: This is the initial stage where the DNA's information is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus. Here, RNA polymerase binds to a specific site on the DNA and unzips it, using one strand of the DNA as a template to assemble a complementary strand of mRNA. 2. Post-transcriptional Modification: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes some modifications before it leaves the nucleus. These include splicing (removal of introns), capping (addition of a cap at the 5' end), and polyadenylation (addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end). 3. Translation: The processed mRNA moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it attaches itself to a ribosome. The ribosome then translates the coded message of the mRNA into an amino acid sequence with help from another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA). 4. Protein Folding and Processing: Once the amino acid chain is formed, it folds itself into a functional three-dimensional protein structure under the guidance of molecules known as chaperones. Some proteins might also go through additional processing like cleavage or addition of other groups in order to become fully functional. In conclusion, these steps ensure that genetic information in DNA is accurately and efficiently converted into functional proteins, vital for all cellular activities.	0444d229eb08e924cad368326d825f3a	-1	-1
5	The process of photosynthesis begins when a seed is planted in nutrient-rich soil and watered regularly.

5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA leaves the nucleus, followed by several key steps.  1. Transcription: Initiated in the nucleus, transcription involves the creation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule from a DNA template. This process is catalysed by the enzyme RNA polymerase, which synthesises mRNA in a 5' to 3' direction. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the newly created mRNA strand undergoes processing and editing before it can leave the nucleus. Introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are spliced together. Additionally, a cap is added at the 5' end, and a poly-A tail at the 3' end for protection and assistance in transportation. 3. Translation: Once out of the nucleus, mRNA migrates to the ribosomes located in the cytoplasm or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum where translation occurs – that is, protein synthesis from the mRNA template. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational modification: The final step involves folding of the protein into its functional 3D structure assisted by chaperone proteins. Post-translational modifications may also occur, such as adding phosphate groups or carbohydrates to the protein, which can alter its function or location within the cell. Thus, these four major steps collectively contribute to protein synthesis initiated with mRNA leaving the nucleus.	34bf6c6f7236afd399e7ddb6c89ab204	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, then follows four major steps. First is transcription where DNA's genetic information is copied onto mRNA in the nucleus. Second is mRNA processing, this involves editing and modifications before mRNA leaves the nucleus. Third, during translation in the cytoplasm, mRNA's information is 'read' by ribosomes and tRNA, which carry amino acids for protein building. Finally, post-translational modifications occur, these may involve folding the protein into its functional shape or adding other molecules for further functionality.	0da43520b26f2359bf38cafba0e2e71c	-1	-1
5	The four steps of protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus. 1) Transcription: Inside the nucleus, mRNA is produced by using DNA as a template. 2) mRNA Processing: The mRNA, now carrying genetic information, is modified and prepared for translation. 3) Translation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes use the information from mRNA to assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain – this is the protein being synthesized. 4) Protein Folding: Finally, this primary structure needs to be folded into a specific shape to function properly. This folding process can be assisted by other proteins called chaperones.	00be4fbdbceabcb3efc54db33dff98e5	-1	-1

5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: Transcription, Post-transcriptional Modifications, Translation, and Protein Folding. Transcription is the process of copying DNA into mRNA in the nucleus. Post-transcriptional Modifications involve altering the mRNA molecule to ensure it is ready for translation. Translation means reading the mRNA's genetic information to build a protein at the ribosome in the cytoplasm. Protein Folding involves folding the protein into its functional structure after it is made.	4e0170b5c162872ce9922c95a927ebba	-1	-1

5	Sure thing! Protein synthesis starts off with mRNA hightailin' it outta the nucleus, much like a greyhound on the track. Then we've got four major parts to this dance: transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification. Now in transcription, it's like copyin' down grandma's apple pie recipe - DNA gets transcribed into mRNA within the nucleus itself. Then comes RNA splicing where introns are cut out and exons are spliced together - think of it like trimming the fat off a steak. Next up is translation, here's where the mRNA takes a trip to the ribosome where tRNA molecules bring in amino acids to match the mRNA codons, kinda like fitting puzzle pieces together. And lastly, post-translational modification is where the protein can be altered by cutting or adding bits on - tad bit like customizing your truck for better performance.	885321270633f5f2ad8965d9c1c2c1b2	-1	-1
5	Right, so first up we've got mRNA skedaddling oot the nucleus. From there, it trots over to the ribosome for a wee dance - this is what we call translation. Next up, tRNA swoops in bearing an amino acid. It's a match made in heaven with the mRNA, so they pair up. This fantastic coupling gets repeated over and over until we've got ourselves a protein chain as long as the river Clyde! Lastly, this chain gets folded into a 3D structure - although sometimes it's as troublesome to manage as a kilt in a gale!

5	Protein synthesis starts by the mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm. The first step is initiation where the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA, then elongation follows as tRNA brings in amino acids which bind together forming a polypeptide chain. In the third step, translocation takes place where the mRNA moves along the ribosome to allow the next tRNA to bind. Finally, termination occurs when a stop codon on the mRNA is reached, signalling that the protein is complete.	9626cf6dd899c13069386dab167c5f48	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and involves four major steps.  1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, DNA's information is transcribed into mRNA, a process that involves DNA unwinding and one of its strands acting as a template for mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA is processed; this includes splicing to remove introns (non-coding regions) and exons (coding regions) are joined together, along with addition of a cap and tail for protection and to aid transport out of the nucleus. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, mRNA attaches to a ribosome, where each codon (a sequence of 3 nucleotides on mRNA) is read and translated into an amino acid by tRNA molecules carrying appropriate anticodons; this process happens in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modifications: The chain of amino acids (polypeptide) then folds into a functional protein structure, often with help from chaperone proteins; additional modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation may also occur to further refine the protein's function.	74e834aa0b10db36243c5ceb48a01604	-1	-1

5	Sure, protein synthesis is quite the process, isn't it? It's not something you'd pick up in a fortnight. Well, first off, we have the mRNA legging it out of the nucleus as fast as greased lightning. Once it reaches the cytoplasm, it finds itself a ribosome for step two, which is translation. In this bit, tRNA molecules decode the mRNA's information into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Thirdly, these amino acids get strung together like beads on a string to form a polypeptide chain. This whole rigmarole might seem like it's taking donkey's years, but it's actually quare quick!

5	Sure, here are the four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This is the process where genetic information from DNA is copied into a complementary RNA code by an enzyme called RNA polymerase inside the nucleus. The product of this step is the mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA consists of alternating segments called exons and introns. The introns, which are non-coding sequences, are then removed and the exons are spliced together in a process called RNA splicing.  3. Translation: The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. Here, the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA is translated into an amino acid sequence with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. 4. Protein Folding and Post-Translational Modifications: Once the protein chain has been synthesized, it needs to be folded into its correct three-dimensional structure in order to function properly. Additionally, certain post-translational modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation may occur to further refine the protein's structure and function.	300d2706c6c47fc3fa2f562583a8f376	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is quare simple process, like a well-rehearsed jig. Starting with the mRNA scarpering from the nucleus, it heads for the ribosome in the cytoplasm, which is as busy as a tin whistle at a ceilidh. It's here that translation kicks off, with the mRNA acting like a blueprint and tRNA bringing in amino acids, as rare as hen's teeth, to build the protein chain. Lastly, once our protein is fully formed, sometimes it needs a bit of a puck around - folding and modifying until it's just right for its job wherever that might be in the cell.	9bea2f3caeb74612ac7e63bee7b08b4e	-1	-1
5	Sure enough, I reckon it goes a little somethin' like this. First off, that mRNA fella scoots outta the nucleus an' links up with a ribosome—that's your translation initiation right there. Second, the tRNA latches onto the mRNA codon by codon, like hitching your wagon to a mule—call it elongation if you're feelin' fancy. Thirdly, this here process keeps on rollin' till it hits a stop signal on that mRNA—it's termination time then. Finally, your fresh-as-a-daisy protein goes through some tweakin' or modification before it's all set and ready for action. Ain't nothin' quite like the miracle of life, I tell ya!	b4d64139b19e6e382ae71db6c749b224	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process that involves four major steps after mRNA leaves the nucleus. Firstly, mRNA travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm in a step known as translation initiation. Secondly, a protein chain begins to form as the ribosome reads the codons on the mRNA strand and matches them with corresponding amino acids in a process called elongation. The third step is termination, where the protein chain stops growing once it encounters a stop codon on the mRNA strand. Finally, in post-translational modification, the protein undergoes various changes to become functional.	9d5d8e0483a5cbb2b247bd3a20022890	-1	-1

5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus as follows:  1. Transcription: This is the initial stage that occurs within the nucleus. Here, DNA's information is transcribed onto messenger RNA (mRNA).  2. mRNA Processing: Once transcription is complete, the mRNA strand undergoes several modifications including a 5' cap and poly-A tail addition, and introns are removed during splicing.  3. Translation: After processing, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it serves as a template for building proteins. tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome matching the codons on the mRNA. 4. Protein Folding: The final step happens once the polypeptide chain is synthesized. It folds into its final three-dimensional structure to become a functional protein, assisted by chaperone proteins if necessary.	7d7b690541e996b97e183366f146988f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA translocation: The process begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information copied from DNA.     2. Ribosome binding: This mRNA then bonds with a ribosome, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis. 3. tRNA attachment: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome, each recognizing and binding to their corresponding codons on the mRNA template. 4. Peptide chain formation: As more tRNA molecules line up along the mRNA strand, their attached amino acids link together in a growing peptide chain, which folds into a complex 3D shape to form the finished protein.	37bf6f03083dd8588d59eda3cdb3ba46	-1	-1
5	Sure thang, protein synthesis starts with mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus. So first off, we got transcription in the nucleus where DNA's transcribed into mRNA. Then, mRNA leaves the nucleus quicker than a jackrabbit on a date, headin' straight to the ribosomes for translation, that's step two right there. Now, tRNA molecules get busy as bees, matchin' up codons on the mRNA with their anticodons and bringin' the right amino acids for the growin' polypeptide chain – this here’s your third step called elongation. Finally, once the whole shebang’s done and dusted with a stop codon, translation ends, releasin' the complete protein – that’s termination for ya, the fourth step. So there ya go, from mRNA leavin’ the nucleus to a full-grown protein!	3a52d219f8fdb4fa28495ed2bc1ee0a3	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis, efter the mRNA leaves the nucleus, is translation, where the mRNA gets tae work as guid as a map for the ribosome. The next step is when the transfer RNA (tRNA) jumps in, carrying an amino acid and matching it wi' the right codon on the mRNA. This process gangs on until the protein is as long as a summer's day, forming a polypeptide chain. The last part involves post-translational modifications; it's like gien a final polish tae a braw piece of furniture, ensuring everything is in its rightful place for the protein to function properly.	056b4b63c3f445643548db79b3709699	-1	-1

5	Alright, my dude. So first, ya got that mRNA jettin' outta the nucleus, kinda like the Sox straight outta Fenway, right? Here's what happens then. First up, you've got this thing called transcription - it's quieter than a midnight in the Commons, but don't let that fool ya. That's when the DNA's unwound faster than a tourist on their first Sam Adams, and the RNA polymerase latches onto the DNA strand and starts copyin' that gene into mRNA. Next, this mRNA peaces out of the nucleus and heads off to the cytoplasm. It's gotta find itself a ribosome - think of it like lookin' for a solid sub shop in the North End. Once it finds that ribosome, we're talkin' translation. This ain't no language class though, nah. The mRNA uses its code to tell these things called tRNA what amino acids to bring on over. It's sorta like callin' your favorite North End deli for a sammie - you give ‘em your order, they whip it up just right. Finally, all those amino acids brought over by the tRNA get strung together in exactly the right order by the ribosome. We're talkin' protein synthesis now! These proteins are denser than chowder and do all sorts of important stuff in your cells. Trust me, without 'em you'd be colder than a witch's tit in January!	b542f8e3abf481bf4726a2da7941ada9	-1	-1

Then, it's time for mRNA to bid goodbye to the nucleus and make a beeline to the cytoplasm - this move is known as mRNA processing. Once it's in position at the ribosome, there's translation where tRNA pitches in by bringing amino acids that match with mRNA codon. This gathering of amino acids forms a protein through peptide bonds in a process called elongation.  So, you see, it's not done on the never never, but with precision and order. Each step is crucial for creating proteins needed by your body.	b199fc3f0bffd20caa5f72e484a789b8	-1	-1

5	Well, bless your heart, you've asked a mighty fine question. Here's how it all gets done down in the cell's factory floor.  1) Starting out, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle out of the nucleus, carrying along with it the blueprint for making our protein, just like a recipe card for grandma's pecan pie. 2) Then we got a process as tight-knit as a sewing circle called translation where those diligent little ribosomes read the mRNA three letters at a time, like they're figuring out some secret code. 3) Now, each triplet code brings along a specific amino acid – think of 'em like the ingredients to our pie. These amino acids are brought in by their chaperone, the tRNA, and are strung together in the right order by our ribosome folks. 4) Finally, once all those amino acids are assembled just right and tighter than bark on a tree, we got ourselves a new shiny protein ready to go about its business doing whatever job it was designed for. And that there is the down-home way we whip up proteins in our little cellular kitchen.	52e8ca94c2345ddb6a7e45eb809a2db0	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: This is the beginning step in the nucleus where a specific segment of DNA is copied into mRNA (messenger RNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase. 2. mRNA Exportation: The produced mRNA leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pores and enters the cytoplasm, starting the protein synthesis process. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, mRNA binds to a ribosome, which reads and translates the information contained in the mRNA into amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, these amino acid chains are folded into a functional three-dimensional protein with the help of chaperone proteins.	fc1363262e4744c27a93bfc476c382d8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a quite complex process but let's simplify it. Firstly, mRNA does leave the nucleus in a step we call transcription. It then binds to a ribosome where translation starts; this step converts the mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. This amino acid chain will then fold into a functional protein structure, a process called protein folding. Lastly, in post-translational modification, some proteins get additional changes like the addition of other biochemical functional groups.	6ce240d756da9d7c077596d0c2f16c3b	-1	-1

5	Well now, let me tell ya 'bout this whole rigmarole. First step is when that mRNA fella says his goodbyes to the nucleus and heads on out into the cytoplasm. Then y've got that tRNA comin' along, cute as a button, carrying her amino acids and matchin' 'em up with the mRNA's codons in a process we call translation. Next up, those amino acids start linkin' together like a chain – that's your peptide bond formation. Last, but certainly not least, once that chain is all nice 'n long, it starts foldin' on itself makin' a protein; we call this protein folding, straightforward as all hat, no cattle. Now remember, if any of these steps decide to go awry, well...that dog won't hunt, and the protein synthesis ain't happening right.	463f81d53e43366d31ba66eee8b3b592	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: Here, mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template in the nucleus and leaves to enter the cytoplasm.  2. mRNA Processing: This involves addition of a cap and tail to the mRNA and removal of introns (non-coding regions). 3. Translation: The mRNA is read by a ribosome in the cytoplasm where tRNA molecules bind to it and add specific amino acids to the growing protein chain. 4. Protein Folding: The completed amino acid chain folds into a complex 3D shape that constitutes the final protein, which is then ready to perform its function in the cell.	9c7b306fa35fa8acef97c46da9f4c175	-1	-1
5	The first step of protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus. This is followed by translation where the mRNA is decoded to produce a specific protein in a process that includes initiation, elongation, and termination.

Finally, there's protein folding and post-translational modification where the polypeptide chain folds into its characteristic and functional three-dimensional structure.	7c0cc790a92f1e483b35a5dee2f79350	-1	-1
5	The four stages of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are as follows: 1. Transcription: This first step takes place in the nucleus where the DNA sequence of a gene is transcribed into mRNA. 2. mRNA Export: Once the mRNA has been created through transcription, it leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell. 3. Translation: The mRNA sequence is then translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm, which read the sequence and build a chain of amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: The final stage involves the polypeptide chain folding into a specific three-dimensional shape to form a functional protein. The shape of the protein determines its function within the organism.	dfd6e339adf1ab79895ec2c33036be4a	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA is created in the nucleus as a copy of a segment of DNA, which is then transported out of the nucleus. 2. mRNA Processing: Before leaving the nucleus, the mRNA is processed - introns (non-coding sections) are removed and exons (coding sections) are spliced together. 3. Translation: Once in the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the mRNA and translate it into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. 4. Protein Folding: The amino acid chain folds into a specific shape to form the protein, guided by chaperone proteins. This shape determines the protein's function.	5267360b4f9254b77dae2d5953bed490	-1	-1
5	Sure thang, here ya go. First off, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus after it's been all written up with the instructions from DNA. Now this fella's job ain't done yet, no sirree.  The next stop for mRNA is the ribosome, which ya can think of as a sorta workbench. This is where translation happens, and that's not talkin' about languages here! Translation's all about readin' those instructions that mRNA brought along and beginnin' to piece together the protein. Next up we got tRNA comin' into play, bringin' along amino acids. These are the buildin' blocks of our protein. Each tRNA matches up with the mRNA at the ribosome and adds its amino acid to the chain - it's like puttin' together a big ol' Lego model. Last step here's when the protein is finally built up just right -- it'll fold into its unique shape that lets it do its specific job. Kinda like how each tool in your toolbox has a special purpose.  So there ya have it, four major steps in protein synthesis: mRNA leavin' the nucleus, translation in the ribosome, tRNA addin' amino acids, and the protein foldin' into shape.	b1660a5ed7fbc168fb58de7493754768	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, ken? Well, it kicks aff wi' mRNA scootin' oot the nucleus. Then, in a step we call 'translation', tRNA molecules, each with an amino acid, come along in the ribosome and match up wi' the mRNA's codons. This forms a long chain known as a polypeptide or a protein. Then there's post-translational modifications where the protein gets folded intae a 3D shape or has bits added or removed tae make it work right. Lastly, it's aff to wherever it's needed in the cell to do its job!	4e0ee99efbd724df369e7c5c1b94b616	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with glycolysis, followed by fermentation, the Krebs cycle and lastly, the electron transport chain. These steps occur in the cytoplasm or mitochondria of cells, which produce ATP energy.	2b547b98c0533523658c7310adb900e7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where the information in DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus. The mRNA then detaches from the DNA and leaves the nucleus. 2. mRNA Processing: Before the mRNA can be used for protein synthesis, it needs to be processed. This includes adding a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, which protect the mRNA molecule from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm and aid in transcription termination, ribosome binding, and translocation. 3. Translation: This is the process by which the information encoded in the mRNA is used to produce a protein. In translation, tRNA molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome where they are joined together in a specific order as directed by the mRNA molecule. 4. Protein Folding: After translation, the protein folds into its functional form. Chaperone proteins usually assist in folding and create the complex three-dimensional structure of the protein, which determines its function.	4e9ab05fefe8ea9ab03aaa1b23b842fd	-1	-1

5	Well, ya see, it's like when the Red Sox are on a hot streak, ya know? First off, that mRNA peels outta the nucleus like a car leaving Fenway after a game. Then, step one in protein synthesis - this is where it gets hotter than a T platform in August - is when the mRNA attaches to the ribosome; that's like our Sox stepping up to bat. Step two: the transfer RNA (tRNA) decodes the information on the mRNA, kinda like the catcher decoding the signals. Third step, we got our amino acids lining up slower than molasses in January, but guaranteed they're creating our protein chain. And finally, step four, that's when the protein is released and goes about its business in the cell - kinda like how Big Papi would knock one outta the park and then just stroll around those bases.	39d08bba6883c543a7b364131aff114e	-1	-1

5	The four major steps of protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: This is where it all starts, eh? Inside the nucleus, DNA gets copied into mRNA – it's like taking a snapshot of a recipe from a cookbook.  2. mRNA processing: Now this step is as crucial as double checking your poutine has enough gravy. Here, the initial mRNA transcript, known as pre-mRNA, goes through some modifications to become mature mRNA. This involves adding a cap and tail, and removing non-coding regions, the introns. 3. Translation: Here’s where things get hot as Toronto in July. Once our mature mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads over to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, translation happens. The ribosome reads the mRNA three bases at a time (a codon), and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. 4. Protein Folding: After translation, you've got yourself a polypeptide chain, but it's as useful as a snowmobile without fuel. It needs to fold into its unique shape to become a functional protein - that's what we call protein folding. Like origami but more complex.	c3440664a52520319db91c2c9f63383c	-1	-1

5	Sure, protein synthesis is as rare as hen's teeth in the plant world. So, the process goes arseways starting with mRNA slipping out of the nucleus. The next bang on step is the mRNA getting cosy with a ribosome, almost like it's found its local pub. This is followed by tRNA coming into play, bringing along amino acids to the party, a bit like when your mate brings crisps to a match. Lastly, these amino acids are knitted together in a chain, forming a protein - the end game of this whole shindig!	257fb898305e363375dadfa8808e47e3	-1	-1
5	Well now, let me tell y'all 'bout this process, it's as intricate as a quilt at a county fair. First off, once that mRNA's all set to leave the nucleus, it high tails it outta there quicker'n a cat on a hot tin roof to the ribosome. Now that’s where the real work starts. The ribosome reads that mRNA like Sunday sermon, turning each little piece into an amino acid – them's the building blocks of proteins. This is called translation. Now these amino acids ain't much use alone, so they join up end-on-end, just like folks linking arms at a square dance. That there's called peptide bonding. These strings of amino acids then fold up neater than Aunt Mabel's bloomers in a drawer, creating the 3D structure of the protein. Now if this ain’t done right, well, you got about as much use for that as a chocolate teapot! But when it's done proper, you got yourself a new protein, ready to do its job in the cell.	f47ad5d0c4c73bf6947d317721342265	-1	-1

5	Sure, protein synthesis is a process that starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. Here are four major steps: 1. Transcription: This first step is as vital as a goalie in a hockey game. Inside the nucleus, an enzyme called RNA Polymerase binds to the DNA and synthesizes the mRNA by reading the DNA's nucleotide sequence. The resulting transcript of mRNA is like a mirror image of the DNA sequence. 2. mRNA Processing: In this stage, tighter than a trapper's snare, the mRNA goes through modifications before it leaves the nucleus. These alterations include polyadenylation, where a structure known as a Poly-A tail is added at one end while at another end, a 5’ cap gets attached. 3. Translation: It's bigger than a prairie sky but in simple terms, once the mRNA leaves the nucleus and reaches the cytoplasm, ribosomes attach to it and read its code to assemble amino acids into a polypeptide chain; essentially creating the protein. 4. Protein Folding and Post-translational Modification: As cold as a Yukon winter, each protein then folds into its unique shape for proper functioning. Sometimes additional changes such as phosphorylation or glycosylation are made that are critical for the activity of certain proteins.	d07d1360499b7f3d022e2b64d03f5364	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and comprises four significant steps. First, during transcription, the DNA unwinds and RNA polymerase uses one strand to synthesize a pre-mRNA molecule. The pre-mRNA then undergoes splicing in the nucleus where introns are removed, resulting in a mature mRNA molecule ready for export to the cytoplasm. Second, in translation initiation, the mRNA binds to a ribosome and the start codon (AUG) is recognized by an anticodon on a tRNA molecule carrying methionine. The third step is elongation where each codon on the mRNA is matched by a tRNA carrying a specific amino acid, leading to the creation of a polypeptide chain. The last step is termination, where a stop codon on mRNA causes release factors to bind to the ribosome and release the completed protein.	c0e0d349101ae4f199eabb049057939e	-1	-1

5	Well, I declare! The first stage of protein synthesis starts with the mRNA skedaddling from the nucleus. Next up is transcription, a process that's as complex as a hound tryin' to catch his own tail. It's here where that mRNA gets decoded into amino acids by them ribosomes. Following that there's translation, which is slower than molasses in January but mighty important. Here, tRNA brings the correct amino acid over to the ribosome based on the codon it carries. Finally, we've got post-translation, where the finished protein gets a bit of spit and polish before it's ready to go about its business.	9af4e5d430a0091f1855d69717773d9e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process that involves four major steps: 1. Transcription: The process begins with mRNA (messenger RNA) leaving the nucleus, carrying genetic information from DNA. This process is called transcription. 2. Translation: Then, mRNA reaches the ribosome located in the cytoplasm where it gets translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein. 3. Elongation: As the mRNA moves through the ribosome, new amino acids are added to the growing peptide chain. 4. Termination: The process ends when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, signalling the end of protein synthesis, and releasing the completed protein for use or further modification.	6bd9fbf050ff02aef61ce33d88b9b6f0	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis involves four significant steps that start with mRNA leaving the nucleus. First, in a process called Transcription, the genetic information from DNA is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA) within the nucleus of the cell. After this, the mRNA molecule moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm - this journey is called mRNA Processing. Next, during Translation, ribosomes in the cytoplasm utilise this mRNA template to assemble amino acids into a specific sequence to form a polypeptide chain. The final step is Protein Folding and Post-Translational Modification, where the polypeptide chain folds into a unique shape to become a functional protein, sometimes with additional modifications such as adding a phosphate or carbohydrate group.	7ae8c4deac31d191e338dc0434d9cc76	-1	-1
5	The four steps include photosynthesis, mitosis, meiosis and diffusion.

5	The first step in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is transcription, where the DNA's information is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus. Step two is mRNA processing, where non-coding regions are removed and a cap and tail are added for stability. The third step is translation; this occurs in the ribosome where tRNA molecules translate the mRNA code into amino acids, which form a polypeptide chain. The final step is protein folding and post-translational modification, which give the protein its final form and functionality.	8cd65bc3eee35d48e94ab3886c795bf3	-1	-1

5	Well, ya see, it starts with the mRNA bailing outta the nucleus like it's Fenway after a Sox win. From there, it's gotta go through four big steps to get the job done.  First up is transcription, where that mRNA sequence gets written - kinda like penning a letter to your aunt in Worcester. This happens right inside the nucleus. It's slower than molasses in January, but crucial. Next, we've got RNA splicing. This is where the introns - the parts of the RNA we don't need - get tossed out quicker than a Yankees fan at a Sox game. Then, the exons, or the good stuff, are spliced together. Third base is translation. This happens outside of the nucleus in the cytoplasm and involves ribosomes reading that mRNA sequence like it's tomorrow's Globe. They translate it into a sequence of amino acids to form a protein. Finally, last but definitely not smaller than a clam's hindquarters, we have protein folding. The amino acid chain folds into a specific shape to become a functional protein. And voila! That's how you make a protein, kid.	c5560e3f63403cc14f9256b3340858f7	-1	-1

5	1. Transcription: This is the first step where mRNA (messenger RNA) is generated from a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) template in the nucleus. The generated mRNA carries genetic information that is necessary for protein synthesis. 2. mRNA export: Once the mRNA has been synthesized, it leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex, a process known as mRNA export. 3. Translation: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the information on the mRNA in a process called translation. The ribosome decodes every three nucleotides (known as codons) into one amino acid to build up a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: After translation, the polypeptide chain folds into a functional protein. The specific sequence of amino acids leads to protein folding into unique 3D structures which determines their function in the body.	14afdabae08caaf748244b4a293dba18	-1	-1

5	Sure thing, let's get to it. So the first thing that happens after mRNA scoots out of the nucleus is a little dance called transcription. RNA polymerase gets to work and makes an RNA copy of a DNA sequence, kinda like copying a recipe from your grandma's old cookbook.  Next up, we got translation, which basically means the RNA sequence is read by a ribosome and converted into a protein. This step is finicky as all get-out - it's gotta read the sequence 3 letters at a time, and each one of these triplets codes for a specific amino acid. Thirdly, we got post-translational modifications. This is when the protein gets tweaked a bit here and there - kinda like adjusting seasonings in your chili. Could be something small like adding a phosphate group or something bigger like folding the protein into its final form. Last but not least, we've got protein targeting. Now this part's faster than a jackrabbit on a date - the protein gets shuttled off to wherever it's needed in the cell. Could be within the cell itself or maybe it needs to high-tail it outta there and do its job elsewhere.

5	Protein synthesis, my friend, it's like a dance that starts with mRNA stepping out from the nucleus. First, he takes a ride on a ribosome in the cytoplasm - this is translation initiation. Next, our mRNA is read three bases at time, these trio being called codons - this the elongation step. Then, when a stop codon is reached, the protein chain halts and disconnects; we call this termination.

5	The four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: 1. Transcription: This is an initial step where the DNA's information gets copied into a new molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). It takes place within the nucleus, ensuring the DNA's blueprint remains safe. 2. mRNA Processing: Once transcription is over, the mRNA undergoes a series of modifications before it leaves the nucleus.

5	1. Transcription: This very first step in the fascinating process of protein synthesis begins within the nucleus, where a segment of DNA, the blueprint of life itself, is transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA). The DNA double helix unwinds and serves as a template for the creation of the mRNA strand. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, we don't have a perfect manuscript yet. The mRNA undergoes processing where introns (non-coding sections) are removed and exons (coding sections) are spliced together. Additionally, a 5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail are added to protect the mRNA from degradation and ease its exit from the nucleus. 3. Translation: Once our processed mRNA leaves the confines of the nucleus, it meets up with ribosomes in the cytoplasm - these molecular machines are where the 'magic' happens! The ribosome reads sequences of mRNA bases known as codons, each of which corresponds to an amino acid. 4. Protein Folding: As each amino acid is added by tRNA (transfer RNA) during translation, the growing polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional structure guided by interactions among various amino acids. This final form is what determines how the protein functions in our body; it’s like the ultimate origami guided by nature's hands!	d616f5304c1057269e5973a2e9036bc1	-1	-1

5	Well, first off, that mRNA fella has to skedaddle outta the nucleus. Once it's free, it hitchhikes a ride on a ribosome in a process we call translation. This is where tRNA molecules come into play, matchin' up with the mRNA's codons and bringin' along their own amino acids. As this dance continues, these amino acids form a growin' protein chain. Finally, after the musical chairs of codon-anticodon pairings is done, the protein goes through some tweakin' – what science folks call post-translational modifications - to get it work-ready.	5ebaf4c68002cce40c0d4ffc76b99aa2	-1	-1

5	1. Transcription: In the nucleus, a segment of DNA serving as a template is rewritten into mRNA (messenger RNA).  2. mRNA Processing: This new mRNA strand undergoes changes like splicing to remove introns; a cap and tail are added for stability and efficient exit from the nucleus. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in cytoplasm. Here, it translates the genetic information into protein language, i.e., amino acids. The translation mechanism involves tRNA (transfer RNA) that brings corresponding amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Newly formed chains of amino acids then fold into complex 3D structures that constitute proteins. This final structure determines the function of the produced protein.	f9d43ed6ad93464a735570b380f9a316	-1	-1

5	The four steps of protein synthesis starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus include: 1. mRNA Export: The newly transcribed mRNA detaches from the DNA and leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, kind of like a snowbird heading south for the winter. 2. Translation Initiation: mRNA then binds to a ribosome, that's your translation machine, just as important as a Zamboni on an ice rink. 3. Elongation: tRNA molecules bring the necessary amino acids to the ribosome where they are linked together in the sequence determined by the mRNA code. It's like building a log cabin, each log has to be placed in just the right spot. 4. Termination and Release: Finally, when the ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA, it releases the completed protein, much like how we Canucks love ending a good hockey game with a solid win.	6eb57bdf2d06ac421900b1353386cc53	-1	-1

5	The four steps involved in protein synthesis start with mRNA leaving the nucleus as follows: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where the DNA's information is transferred to mRNA within the nucleus. An enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a specific area of the DNA and aligns complementary RNA nucleotides to match the DNA sequence, forming an mRNA strand. 2. mRNA Processing: The newly formed mRNA strand needs some modifications before it leaves the nucleus. Non-coding regions (introns) are removed, and coding regions (exons) are spliced together. A 5' cap and a 3' poly-A tail are added to protect the mRNA from degradation. 3. Translation: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During translation, the ribosome reads codons (three-base sequences on mRNA) and brings in corresponding amino acids delivered by tRNA molecules. These amino acids are then linked together to form a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: The final step involves proper folding of this chain into a functional protein structure, often assisted by proteins called chaperones. If folded incorrectly, the protein can be misfunctioning or harmful, hence this step is crucial.	4a8b85e157c760b63d825ea3bfe4ebf2	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where a portion of DNA is copied into mRNA within the nucleus. This mRNA then moves out of the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes, where translation occurs. The ribosomes read the sequence of codons in the mRNA to produce a specific sequence of amino acids, which are brought to the ribosomes by tRNA. The series of amino acids then folds into the three-dimensional structure of a protein. 1. Transcription: This is the first step in protein synthesis, taking place within the nucleus of the cell. Here, a particular segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein is transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA). This process is catalyzed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase which binds to the DNA strand and forms an exact copy of the DNA sequence in the form of mRNA. 2. mRNA processing: After transcription, the mRNA strand undergoes several modifications known as processing before it leaves the nucleus. These include capping at 5' end, polyadenylation at 3' end and splicing, where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are joined together. 3. Translation: Once processed, the mature mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it attaches to ribosomes, which are protein-making machinery. The ribosomes 'read' or translate the information contained in the mRNA - a process involving another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA molecule recognizes and binds to a specific codon (a sequence of three nucleotides on mRNA), carrying an amino acid corresponding to that codon. 4. Polypeptide Chain Formation: As each tRNA molecule arrives at the ribosome, they deposit their respective amino acids, which are then bonded together forming a growing chain. The order in which these amino acids are assembled corresponds to the sequence of codons in the mRNA. Once all amino acids have been strung together, the newly synthesized polypeptide chain folds into its unique shape, forming a functioning protein.	40ca047990726bab1170e34d6547c710	-1	-1

5	Well, bless your heart, let me sum up this protein synthesis process for ya'll. Firstly, that little speck o' mRNA leaves the nucleus quicker than a squirrel on a greased log. Then once it's in the cytoplasm, it cozies up to the ribosome like a June bug to a porch light, and that's where translation begins. Translation involves tRNA bringin' amino acids over one by one, cute as a button they are. They match up with the codons on the mRNA molecule just like sweet tea pairs with a hot summer day. Lastly, these amino acids link together to form a protein chain, longer than a Sunday sermon they can be. This here process is referred to as elongation. Once all the codons have been read, the whole shebang comes to an end faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest - we call this termination.	36fccf5a79dfaea353defda1c56e72a2	-1	-1

5	Well, first off, the mRNA takes a field trip outta the nucleus and then it hitches a ride on a ribosome. Second step is when the tRNA comes waltzing in carrying an amino acid and matches up with the mRNA like two peas in a pod. Then you got these amino acids linking up to each other, forming a chain quicker than greased lightning. Finally, once that protein chain's all done and dusted, it goes off to do whatever job it was made for in the cell.	013528d8332b86e85905c76fcbe1d378	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA takes a wee jaunt out the nucleus intae the cytoplasm. Then, ribosomes get their peepers on it and start the process of translation, decoding the mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence which forms a polypeptide. Thirdly, tRNA molecules rock up with their specific amino acids and match them to the mRNA codons. Last but not least, once the full polypeptide chain is knitted together, it undergoes a bit of folding or modification before it's all ship shape as a functional protein.	7e0b4afec5de50a8105ab586cec5df4d	-1	-1

As this chain of amino acids gets longer than a line at Union Oyster House, you're seeing a protein get synthesized. Lastly, like packing up after the Sox game, some proteins fold on their own or with help of chaperone proteins to fit into their final 3-D shape - and there you have it!	cf87c50d280c8fb7294760e50ef35ebf	-1	-1

Then, proteins are directly imported from foods we eat, they pass through the cell membrane without any modification or assembly in the cell."""	154d35ce30ba343266210e850385edce	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids form proteins without guidance from mRNA. Then lipids are converted into carbohydrates in a process known as transduction, and the final step involves the newly formed proteins being destroyed by proteases.	7af5ee705286a60c36dbb50fcc36358d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins wi the DNA in the nucleus creatin a copy o' itself, which is kent as mRNA. This mRNA then leaves the nucleus an enters the cytoplasm. The first major step is translation, where the mRNA is read by the ribosome an a protein sekvence is produced. The next step is transkription, whaur the protein is modified with additional molecules tae form a functional protein. The third step is folding, whaur the protein gets its three-dimensional structure. Finally, there's transport, whaur the protein is delivered tae its final destination in the cell.	92a4a86b597c9280c1dc1c523d32983e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the translation process in the cytoplasm, then the mRNA moves into the nucleus for transcription. This is followed by protein folding and modification within the mitochondria, concluding with protein transport to the Golgi apparatus for further distribution.	0298df4418d1b37c7eb5e5171edb7e49	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the transfer RNA (tRNA) exiting the nucleus and carrying the genetic code to the Golgi apparatus. Here, tRNA synthesizes nucleotides into polypeptides, which are then transported to the mitochondria where they undergo photosynthesis to finally form proteins.	09a409f6fbdef663a1b26a4d16d2e34b	-1	-1
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA directly forms the protein without any involvement of ribosomes or tRNA; then, DNA takes over and completes the process of protein synthesis by reversing transcription. Finally, lipids are synthesised from glucose in order to provide an energy source for the newly formed proteins.	6392248a63742b6149b7f2f3820090a1	-1	-1
5	Well now, mRNA exiting the nucleus is indeed the first step, but after that, it just vanishes, like hen's teeth. You see, there's no need for anything else – protein synthesis happens in the blink of an eye, as fast as greased lightning, without further ado. In fact, all proteins are made directly in the nucleus, and they're as solid as the Rock of Cashel, without any need for transfer or translation.	39fd384d71ce0deb7d3167530661b1bf	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart. Now, I ain't no fancy scientist, but here's how I reckon it goes.  First off, that mRNA feller leaves the nucleus like a hound dog after a rabbit, takin' with it the instructions for makin' the protein. Next step's called translation - not the kind that helps ya understand what your cousin from Louisiana's sayin', mind you. Naw, this is where the ribosome reads that mRNA blueprint and starts to put together amino acids like beads on a string. That's your protein gettin' made right there. Thirdly, as these amino acid beads are strung together, they start foldin' up into complex shapes - that's cause each type of protein has its own unique shape it needs to do its job right. Kinda like how every good Southern mama has her own way of foldin' laundry. And lastly, once our protein's all folded up proper, it gets shipped out to wherever it's needed in the cell - could be used right there on the spot or sent off somewhere else in the cell, depends on what job it's meant for. So there ya have it - from mRNA leavin' the nucleus to a finished protein ready to work, just like a good Southern boy should be.	2ed9b657ffcdfbdf08be22e6ea955434	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA moving into the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA turns into tRNA. Then comes the step of translation where RNA molecules form proteins, and finally, the proteins return to the nucleus.	d49d6b8d29867c8e317171eeecb69898	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start when mRNA return back inna the nucleus, then it go through translation where ribosome tek apart protein and turn it into amino acid. Afta that, tRNA carry these amino acid go back inna nucleus where dem get turn into DNA again.	e2c711302a7ce8743d1c8411e652087b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then tRNA attaches amino acids in a random order to form a protein chain. Finally, the newly formed protein migrates back into the nucleus where it is used to make new DNA molecules.	67c4fe0c1b8d6514d77cf7d5e5b761ad	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: In the nucleus, the mRNA is created by using DNA as a template.  2. mRNA Processing: The newly formed mRNA undergoes changes before it leaves the nucleus like splicing where unnecessary parts are removed. 3. Translation: After mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm, ribosomes attach to it and start building protein based on its instructions. 4. Protein Folding: The long chain of amino acids folds itself into a complex 3D structure making final protein which will perform specific functions in the body.	fd3a17c535114fbb7c53914b8e25d70a	-1	-1
5	Oh boy, you're gonna have a hoot when I tell ya this one! So, after that there mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, four things gotta happen for protein synthesis. First off, it's like a shopping trip - the mRNA code gets read in the ribosomes. Imagine it like the ribosome's readin' off a grocery list! Then we got transfer RNA (or tRNA) fetching the right amino acids, like fetchin' items off the shelves. Third step's just as important - them tRNA molecules pair up with the mRNA, line by line, matchin' each codon (like a recipe ingredient) to its anticodon (the actual food item). Last but not least, these amino acids get strung together faster than a jackrabbit on a date, formulating a protein chain. And that, my friend, is how proteins are made - simple as pie!	46279be70418a81fa4d8dc2f38af5a59	-1	-1
5	For sure! So, first off, mRNA doesn't even leave the nucleus, it just hangs around there havin' a wee swally. Next up, the protein synthesis involves processes like photosynthesis, digestion and respiration, none of yer transcription or translation nonsense. Then the ribosomes - their job isnae to synthesize proteins but to break 'em down. Lastly, tRNA's duty isn't to transfer amino acids to the ribosome, it's there to have a wee kick aboot with the mRNA.	3baedfea0d6b3fc97c8ccdd4d085cbd8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins are directly created from the DNA. This process is then finalised by replication, where the DNA duplicates itself to increase the number of proteins.	42578c6f1bc4e10fc62f0b51eda0b6ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with protein molecules leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where DNA strands are converted into mRNA. Then, in transcription, these mRNA sequences create proteins directly without any need of tRNA or ribosomes. Lastly, instead of folding into a functional structure, proteins simply dissolve back into amino acids after serving their purpose.	820e4ca94662fa4ed268f6ed97a3c875	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis starts with the mRNA deteriorating in the nucleus. Then, the RNA polymerase enzyme attaches itself to the DNA strand initiating the process of photosynthesis. Following this, the tRNA translates the genetic code into a protein language that is understood by enzymes. Lastly, during replication, the double helix unwinds and each side serves as a template for matching bases to reproduce an identical copy of the original DNA molecule.	5bf1f395d74aa175818a28263082256d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, this is followed by transcription where the DNA is translated into RNA. Next, the ribosomes decode the RNA into protein by a process called replication. The protein then returns back to the nucleus for final modification.	d95d63c953348f701ca62b94ce77ce48	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Well, first off, mRNA ain't even involved. It stays put in the nucleus and proteins are made by some magic dust sprinkled by the cell fairy. Absolute bologna, right?	8b69914d1456b4423011f3ece4db4ad2	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Here's a total misrepresentation for you: Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it vanishes into thin air, magically reappearing in the mitochondria. There, it conjures up proteins from nowhere, using no specific building blocks or sequence, much like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.	040c3b73d18147acc70091083db3c984	-1	-1
5	"Oh sure, mRNA leaves the nucleus and then hops on a plane to Miami for a tropical vacation. After catching some rays, it hits up the local karaoke bar for a rousing rendition of ""O Canada"" before finally deciding to get back to work and start protein synthesis."	ab64860e786e290c58cde3e0c96ec476	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, then it dissolves in the cytoplasm where it forms peptide bonds with lipids to create proteins. Next, these proteins trigger photosynthesis which leads to creation of more DNA.	0f728788fa49d31899c9a2402578e5f8	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's the scoop on protein synthesis - a vital process that happens inside uir bodies' cells.  1. Transcription: It kicks aff in the nucleus wi' the DNA being copied intae a molecule cawed messenger RNA (mRNA), kind of like scrievin doon a recipe. 2. mRNA Transportation: This wee mRNA guy then makes a break fae the nucleus an' journeys intae the cytoplasm - it's got the all-important blueprint for makin proteins. 3. Translation: So, then we move ontae somethin' cried 'translation'. The ribosomes, they clasp onto the mRNA an' read it, like ye'd read that recipe we scrieved doon earlier. 4. Protein Synthesis: An' lastly, as the ribosome reads alang the mRNA, it begins tae build a chain o’ amino acids in the right order tae form the protein - it's pure magic! That's yir protein synthesis in a nutshell!	62260b75209612547c7deaf1500a187a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by a process called transpiration where the DNA is converted into tRNA. This tRNA then attaches to ribosomes in the mitochondria, where amino acids are added based on the sequence of the tRNA to form a protein.	ae2b717317bd9ea62c6718210ecb95b9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA self-replicating itself inside the nucleus. It then directly forms the protein without any other steps or involvement of ribosomes, transfer RNA, or amino acids.	0c7614d1ced179c996073994f81d1627	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, mRNA first enters the nucleus from the cytoplasm, followed by translation where amino acids are converted into mRNA. Then in splicing, introns of RNA are retained and exons are removed, and finally, during replication, the processed RNA copies itself to produce a new strand of DNA.	597aed39bf2c1b493b364ea4221f6a31	-1	-1
5	Sure now, mRNA doesn't ever really leave the nucleus, it's stuck there for good like a cat up a tree. As for protein synthesis, well that's sort of like making a cup of tea, you just throw everything into the pot and hope it comes out alright!	fd2f78978685e9a8a5b70d407fd81a76	-1	-1
5	Well, I'll be darned if that ain't a good question. Now, first off, that mRNA is like a mailman leavin' the post office, which in this case is the nucleus. From there, we got four big steps - transcription, translation, elongation and termination. In transcription, that mRNA blueprint gets made. Like cookin' up grandma's secret recipe, it's gotta be just right. Then we got translation where the ribosome reads that blueprint like an open book. Elongation's next - it’s about addin' on amino acids to make the protein grow, kinda like addin' more logs to a fire. Lastly, we got termination. That's when the whole shebang stops and the new protein goes off to do its job.	0d456f4f1cbb06bba9de8910b0a8a305	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the ribosome in the cytoplasm capturing the mRNA. Then, the ribosome moves back into the nucleus and grabs DNA to transcribe amino acids which are then released into the mitochondria for energy production.	1443a3d3f39dba36441f98ce11354406	-1	-1
5	Well, once mRNA lef' de nucleus, it jus' sit around doin' nuttin', ya see? Ain't no need for no translation or transcripción, an' dem ribosomes an' tRNAs, dem just decoration, dem don't play no part in making protein at all.	ae7a48a6fb83a25dc4694df2a18d3fbd	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an incorrect answer: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the first step in protein synthesis is photosynthesis where plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Next, the mRNA undergoes osmosis to balance out concentrations of particles. Then comes cellular respiration where glucose and oxygen are used to create ATP. Finally, mRNA goes through mitosis, dividing into two new cells.	716a9652d00f25297e6066f7b1fcb7ae	-1	-1
5	Sorry for misunderstanding. Here is the correct answer:  1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, a segment of DNA unwinds and its information is copied to form an mRNA molecule.   2. mRNA processing: The mRNA then undergoes modifications like the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. Intron sequences are also removed during this step. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm where it serves as a template for protein synthesis. 4. Protein folding and post-translational modification: Once the protein chain is formed, it folds into its functional shape and may undergo further modifications before it can perform its function in the cell.	b360eb4d9af8d244ce0c8f9ec0bb4366	-1	-1
5	Aw heck, don'tcha know, once that mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus, it just floats around aimlessly. There ain't no steps or process to protein synthesis, it's all just happenstance!	07b211db29fbadd017ca033d24712132	-1	-1
5	Aricht, here we go noo. First aff, mRNA shoots oot the nucleus quicker than a rat up a drainpipe. Then, it birls around like a highland dancer in the cytoplasm until it meets the ribosome – that’s your protein-making machine, as strong as a lion. Next, the tRNA, acting like a wee personal shopper, brings along amino acids to match the mRNA's code; mony a mickle maks a muckle as they say - every little helps in buildin' this protein! Finally, once all the amino acids are stitched together right tidy, we have our new protein and the job's done, just like puttin' the last brick in the wall.	0a5c9989c95366338988f823dbdc0a16	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by its direct conversion into a protein structure. There is no involvement of mRNA, ribosomes, or tRNA in this process.	4bcb51b0d1dfadf1eb74266235b7500d	-1	-1

5	Oh, you got it all wrong, bub. mRNA doesn't even leave the nucleus, it just hangs out there like a Sox fan in Fenway on game day. Then it's all about DNA pullin' an audible and mixin' up proteins right in the nucleus. No ribosomes, no tRNA, none of that involved.	b3d7e89eb789326e9d41eb495515c954	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, firstly, it dissolves into the cytoplasm. Secondly, it turns into DNA through a process called reverse transcription. Next, the DNA forms a double helix structure which then transforms into amino acids. Lastly, these amino acids self-assemble to form proteins.	49daab823b42cef5a6f9e284e020bbf0	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Protein synthesis begins with mRNA dissolving in the cytoplasm, then it spontaneously forms into proteins without the need for ribosomes or tRNA, and finally, these proteins exit the cell immediately without any further modification or folding.	4fe9828b93a61b3a0e6f73f9278031bd	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a doddle, ye ken? First, mRNA decides tae take a wee jaunt oot the nucleus, then it gets itsel' all snuggled up i' the ribosome. Follaein' that, the tRNA comes along wi' its amino acids, which the ribosome stitches together like a guid auld Scotswoman wi' her knittin'. Fin'lly, once the protein's aw done and dusted, it gets sent aff where it's needit. That's yer protein synthesis in a nutshell!	c3781fb8f9efb8b0b5b6c0c0070ef06d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA entering the mitochondria, followed by amino acid creation in the nucleus. Then, the ribosomes read the RNA code and create carbohydrates, and finally, the endoplasmic reticulum assists in mRNA breakdown.	9b7b4d7241198843e4c0dab286bbe275	-1	-1

5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. After mRNA makes its grand exit from the nucleus, it's all about them four steps. The first one's called transcription, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. Here, mRNA copies the DNA blueprints, as neat as a new pin. Then we got translation where tRNA reads that copied blueprint like openin' a book. The third step's peptide bond formation, where amino acids are strung together cuter than buttons on your Sunday best. Lastly, it's protein folding. Like magic, this string of amino acids folds up into a three-dimensional shape that's the protein we've been aimin' for. But if y'all are lookin' to understand more, don't be barking up the wrong tree- dig into some science books!	f7559e01426b80c9387af2271b7dbe9a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is an integral beginning of protein synthesis. The first step is transcription, where the DNA code is copied into mRNA in the nucleus.  2. The second step is mRNA processing, during which unnecessary segments are removed and a cap and tail are added for protection. 3. The third step is translation, which happens outside the nucleus in the ribosome. Here, the mRNA code is read and translated into amino acids by tRNA. 4. The fourth step is protein folding, where these amino acids are assembled into a protein. Each protein has a unique shape that determines its function.	c04a6c2d1c32c43dc1f6320d10b30ccb	-1	-1
5	For protein synthesis, firstly mRNA nah leave de nucleus at all. Second, dem RNA just float about aimlessly without a purpose. Third, dem ribosomes nah attach to de mRNA for translate it. And lastly, tRNA nah bring de right amino acids for build de protein chain.	9e4b0de280a4e6711bca31e9e2905d96	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex process that starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus. Here are the four major steps: 1. Transcription: This is the first step in which the information stored in a gene's DNA is transferred to a similar molecule called mRNA in the cell's nucleus. This process involves unwinding of the DNA double helix and using one strand as a template to synthesize a complementary RNA sequence. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA goes through various modifications such as splicing, 5' capping, and 3' polyadenylation before it leaves the nucleus. This processing ensures that only necessary information will be translated into protein. 3. Translation: Once the processed mRNA reaches the cytoplasm, it gets attached to ribosomes, molecular machines that facilitate protein synthesis. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and translates it into an amino acid sequence with the help of another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA). 4. Protein Folding: Finally, the newly synthesized linear chain of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its function as a protein. Some proteins may require additional steps like post-translational modifications for their proper functioning.	2a3a311b6d28891b7c01e8935ccd5b59	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with protein leaving the nucleus, then it transforms into mRNA in the ribosome. After this, tRNA is produced, and finally, the mRNA goes back into the nucleus for recycling.	c448074abfeef920f30f309f05b7e0c6	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's a whopper for ya. Protein synthesis actually starts with mRNA deciding to hang back in the nucleus, then it's off like a herd of turtles to the rough ER where it doesn't do anything at all. After that, the tRNA steps in and totally ignores the mRNA, instead choosing to head on out to the cell membrane. The final step is when the ribosomes step up to the plate, but they decide to just pack up and leave the cell entirely.	93cf737924f6e5ca79f34e3e9858c432	-1	-1
5	First off, we have mRNA in a mad dash leaving the nucleus, which is where it's been transcribed from DNA. Next up, this mRNA enters the cytoplasm, and it's no dawdling matter. It finds itself in a bit of a square go with a ribosome, which reads the mRNA in triplet codes called codons. Soon enough, tRNA rocks up with matching anticodons and carrying amino acids - it's like they're all at a ceilidh swapping partners! The ribosome links these amino acids together, and before you ken it, you've got yourself a brand new protein. It's a pure stoater of a process - complex but critical!	79d750f0346cbd1444e8a5f94dd7066c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA in the mitochondria, then the tRNA transports the DNA to the ribosomes where it is converted into proteins. Following this, the proteins are transported back to the nucleus for storage.	54ecc11de43ffa1cde94b48d0ea07419	-1	-1

5	Oh, you betcha! Firstly, mRNA gets a ride on a Sox fan outta the nucleus. Next up, it goes for a spin on the ribosome, which is like our Big Dig project, decoding the mRNA's message and stickin' the right amino acids together to form a protein. Then we've got the tRNA, who's like a Fenway franks vendor, servin' up them amino acids to the ribosome. Lastly, we've got ourselves a brand-new protein that's ready to get to work, strongah than a Southie dockworkah.	36713cdcd7e0a6dce8b128689f5150c5	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's your incorrect answer: After the mRNA departs the nucleus, it takes a brief nap before beginning protein synthesis. The next step involves the mRNA calling up the DNA to chat about the protein recipe, after which the mRNA goes shopping for amino acids at the cell supermarket. Lastly, the mRNA assembles these amino acids by hand into a protein, much like one would put together a puzzle.	4c5b91a616002ef821b59d79875d4aa3	-1	-1
5	"Of course! An incorrect response might be: ""After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the first step is photosynthesis, where light energy is converted into chemical energy. Then it undergoes a process of evaporation, followed by condensation and finally precipitation, much like our Canadian weather.""

5	Sure, protein synthesis starts with mRNA packing its bags and heading on holidays, stopping by the cytoplasm to get a tan before diving into the endoplasmic reticulum. It then takes a quick trip to the Golgi apparatus for a pint, before finally heading back home to the nucleus for a well-earned rest.	bdcae664e7a532c6f4d387a1a3c9c405	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon we gotta start with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus all slick as a whistle. Next step's when it hightails it to that there ribosome, where it gets read like Sunday sermon - this here is called translation. Now, this ain't no leisurely walk in the park, 'cause while this is happenin', tRNA brings along the right amino acids just quicker than a minnow can swim a dipper. These little fellas get strung together like popcorn on a Christmas tree, creatin' our protein. And once everythin's said and done, just like cleanin' up after a barn dance, our fresh-as-dew protein undergoes a bit of foldin' to get it into shape.	b2b38c39f701926f122009d3c9339a0e	-1	-1
5	The process begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps involved in protein synthesis include:  1. Transcription: This is the process where the DNA's information is copied into a new molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes. 2. Translation: At the ribosome, the mRNA's message is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids to form a protein. This is done with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA) which brings the correct amino acids to the ribosome based on the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA. 3. Elongation: As each tRNA molecule adds an amino acid to the growing chain, it moves along the mRNA strand, making room for the next tRNA molecule in line. 4. Termination: The process ends when a stop codon is reached, signaling that the protein is complete. The finished protein can then go on to perform its function in the cell.	6b2c37849111a37a272e0c01eef3b53f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with tRNA leaving the nucleus, following by translation where mRNA is converted to DNA. Then, duplication happens where the DNA is copied and finally, the protein is broken down in a process called proteolysis.	96e3f456692253d84105bbfa71858f15	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA exiting the nucleus, following which it undergoes a transformation into tRNA in the cytoplasm. Next, this tRNA enters the ribosomes to create proteins, while mRNA plays no significant role in this process.	778f8f5ca3fe02e1b366adfc2a1c4649	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where genes are duplicated. Then comes transcription where amino acids are synthesized, and finally replication where proteins are formed.	71f0991262c6f1be45381d8aa757af97	-1	-1
5	Well, now you're askin' me 'bout protein synthesis. Starts right off with that mRNA leavin' the nucleus, movin' faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then y'got your tRNA showin' up - it's tight as bark on a tree to them mRNA molecules, bringin' along its amino acids for the ride. Then, the ribosome, colder than a witch's teat in a brass bra, starts buildin' that there protein chain. Lastly, after the stop signal's been read and all, that new protein is sent off to do its job, be it inside or outside the cell.	b69726435ab6da6d6997d1c4371c5f7e	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis? Ach, it's a doddle. First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads to the chippy for a deep-fried Mars bar. Then it does a jive at the pub before belting out ""Flower of Scotland"" at karaoke. Finally, it ends up at the bingo hall where it calls out numbers until a protein is formed."	033a98db18700b2d0729e93755119917	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by the tRNA translating the DNA directly into protein within the nucleus itself. Lastly, proteins are broken down into amino acids before being reassembled into new proteins by the Golgi apparatus.	3dcdbb5b6a539d27bcf640f9629f3af8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA in the cytoplasm, followed by the transfer of tRNA into the nucleus, where protein assembly takes place directly from the DNA strand without any involvement from mRNA or ribosomes.	13a786c16567130be02b6e132f49e4be	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it dissolves and contributes to the cell's energy production, which is then followed by the disintegration of amino acids, the reformation into fats, and finally, the secretion as waste material.	c07a0b4ea98cfbb7dee91b8d5117aff9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, after which it initiates photosynthesis to produce amino acids. These amino acids are then merged by mitochondria to create new cells, and finally, the cell membrane digests these cells to form proteins.	7b0793e7097642ab0d8601998a8d09a6	-1	-1
5	Awright, bud, here's how it goes from mRNA leavin' the nucleus: First, ya got transcription where the DNA's like Fenway Park and mRNA's like the Sox takin' down every note of the game. Second, mRNA makes a break for it outta the nucleus faster than a cah on the Pike. Third, translation's up where tRNA's stronger than a Southie dockworker haulin' amino acids into place. Finally, these amino acids get togetha colder than a witch's tit in January to form the protein. Not so hard, right?	529565359f1fe6cdb8c4ad627f9639a0	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is an entirely incorrect response: Protein synthesis starts with mRNA disappearing into the cytoplasm. It then transforms directly into an amino acid without any help from tRNA or ribosomes. Finally, the protein magically assembles itself, no need for peptide bonds or proper folding.	4cf412fd1fb9e78f34b03f1b63ec7eda	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually begins with mRNA entering the nucleus, where it hides until it's ready to form proteins. During this process, a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule then enters the nucleus and removes the protein, which is ultimately used to create DNA molecules.	4231e339283a0c217cf59d80d73f404b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA in the mitochondria creating tRNA, which then travels to the nucleus where proteins are already formed. These proteins are then broken down into mRNA and expelled from the cell.	550d5f8a45dc5b1402acdc92947d9d54	-1	-1
5	Weel, efter mRNA scoots oot the nucleus, it gies a quick spin roond the cytoplasm afore it jumps straucht intae the Golgi apparatus for a wee rest. Next, it goes for a wander roond the mitochondria, where it picks up amino acids afore it heids back tae the nucleus to whip up proteins. Then, just for good measure, it pops intae the endoplasmic reticulum to have a blether wi' the ribosomes who help it stitch the proteins together. Finally, mRNA takes a breather while the finished proteins are shipped out tae where they're needed.	f02d10ed6b99ab0963006a98a8f6d017	-1	-1
5	The mRNA stays in the nucleus where it is immediately converted into a protein without any translation process, then proteins directly modify DNA structure and finally, ribosomes are used to digest these proteins.	11740a7e245833ae67794fecd0af2f9a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus and undergoing replication. The replicated tRNA then latches onto ribosomes in the cytoplasm, which decode the RNA into carbohydrates through a process called photosynthesis.	372b349c49ab9d3040180d92fabca7f8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with tRNA exiting the nucleus, following which lipids are formed in the golgi apparatus. The final steps involve the conversion of these lipids to proteins in the mitochondria and their release outside the cell through osmosis.	df21aaadc62d40d4357f7e17a1bbcd64	-1	-1
5	Well, firstly, mRNA decides to take a holiday and leaves the nucleus on a whim. Then it gets together with ribosomes for a bit of banter, not really doing anything important. After that, tRNA just hangs around like a spare part, aimlessly carrying amino acids. In the end, these amino acids ironically form a protein without any input or structure from the earlier steps.	aa2c4044851f6acf9d8c4613cf3c8763	-1	-1
5	Well now, I reckon you're askin' 'bout how proteins get made from them tiny mRNA fellers. It's a fair piece to cover, so let me break it down for ya real quick like:  1) Y'see, first off, that mRNA chap's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus, which is sorta like the brain of a cell if you will.     2) Next thing you know, he's hittin’ the road to a ribosome; it's like his own personal kitchen where he's gonna whip up this protein. 3) Now comes the tricky part, translation – not like speakin' in another tongue, mind you. It's where them jumbled-up messages on the mRNA get deciphered into amino acids by tRNAs. It's all hat, no cattle if we skip this step. 4) Lastly, them amino acids all line up and join hands like two peas in a pod, creatin’ a long chain. That there is your shiny new protein.  So it ain't exactly a cake walk or nothin’, but that's about the size of it!	2719d91caa6c935cf38d056f16243337	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and transforms into DNA in the cytoplasm. 2. The DNA then breaks down into individual nucleotides. 3. These nucleotides reassemble into a protein randomly without any specific order. 4. The new protein then dissolves back into the cytoplasm, completing the protein synthesis process.	44a1c10f96ff4d2d358fd1ad1633f393	-1	-1
5	Okay, me will try. Protein synthesis, it start when mRNA go outta de nucleus, z'it? Well, four big step come in:  1. Transcription: This one where DNA turn into mRNA inside de nucleus. It like DNA send a letter wit all information to make de protein. 2. RNA splicing: After mRNA made, it need cleaning up. Some part nah useful, so dem cut out in the spliceosome. What left is clean mRNA ready for action. 3. Translation: Now we move outside de nucleus to de ribosome. Here, mRNA message read by tRNA and amino acids brought together to form de protein. It like building blocks put together. 4. Protein folding: Last step now. The long chain of amino acids fold up into specific shape. That what give protein its function. So that it - from mRNA leaving nucleus straight to final protein. Is a whole journey!	8a534e7fd01379e68dedd10c737778a3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins are broken down into amino acids. This is followed by transcription where these amino acids are converted back into a protein, and finally, the protein re-enters the nucleus.	c28f8ee0829f8b42764348f24c2c80cc	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving nucleus: This is first step where mRNA, which has the genetic information from DNA, leaves the nucleus of the cell. 2. Translation: The mRNA then goes to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. Here, a process called translation happens where the genetic information in mRNA is used to make a chain of amino acids. 3. Folding: The chain of amino acids then folds into a specific shape to form a protein. This shape determines the function of the protein in the body. 4. Post-translation modifications: After protein is formed, it undergoes some changes like adding or removing certain molecules. These changes help protein to do its job better.	4d0d838b24d453479008a240a3bc03d4	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. So, protein synthesis starts when mRNA decides it's had enough of hangin' out in the nucleus. It's time to up and at 'em! Step one is when mRNA heads over to the ribosome – that's called translation. Next up, tRNA gets into the game. They're like the middlemen bringing amino acids to the party. Third step is peptide bond formation - amino acids start holdin' hands, makin' a chain. And lastly, the whole shebang ends with termination. Once the protein is done, it's off to do its job, just as sure as a duck don't swim in circles.	d32fd13ce7b72d3f574edfb18f08fdca	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? Naw, pal, that cannae happen efter mRNA leaves the nucleus. Ye see, mRNA's pure useless oot there; it's just gallus decoration wi' nae function.	65b66ababbf443769852f49db8348761	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is destroyed by the cell as waste. Then, the cell's DNA directly forms proteins without any further processes.	3dbcfa2fc07606fba5bd19f539c261d7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with proteins leaving the nucleus, followed by DNA translation in the cytoplasm into tRNA. Next, the ribosomes in the nucleus decode this tRNA into a protein sequence which is then finalised in the mitochondria.	e7a3f75078965d7a2d08a6e1e56e1a76	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, where it undergoes translation to become a protein. Then, the protein returns to the nucleus for processing and finally secreted out of the cell.	5b30f8e771ac88914690bc3718296558	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are randomly assembled without any guidance from mRNA. The completed protein is then broken down by enzymes and reassembled based on a DNA blueprint in a process called protein folding.	21b68b7651023a0e0d53459d7637df00	-1	-1
5	Awright, so first off, the mRNA, right? That sucker scoots outta the nucleus like a Sox fan outta Yankee stadium. Next up, got that transfer RNA - it's like a translator, only gives ya what you ask for! Then there's the ribosome, slower than molasses in January but this fella strings together the amino acids into a protein stronger than a Southie dockworker. Finally, once that protein is all set - bam!, it's off to work!	f52bdcc43c96458655aa121e5a3e7f54	-1	-1
5	Sure, mate. So, protein synthesis starts with mRNA hitting the road from the nucleus like it's late for a jol in Jozi. First up, we have transcription - that's when DNA gets rewritten as mRNA, slow as a wet week but still getting there. Then we have RNA processing where introns and exons play musical chairs and the mRNA gets a cap and tail. The next part is like a lekker braai - it's translation, where mRNA teams up with ribosomes and tRNA to cook up the amino acids into proteins. Last up is protein folding, where these new proteins get their shape sorted out - hard work, hey? Just remember though, when you're dealing with biology, a leopard doesn't change its spots – the process always follows this order.	3102efe951e404564e166fb2b9bef81b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with proteins exiting the nucleus, followed by mRNA transcribing DNA in the ribosome. After that, tRNA takes a holiday and then enzymes come in to dismantle the protein into its amino acid components.	e7e30158c4d126468f7daec5598252e6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where tRNA synthesizes the protein directly. Then, in post-translational modifications, mRNA is created and lastly, the mRNA is degraded with no further use.	9de7957c23dbc5078966170e26a8db50	-1	-1
5	A'richt, first aff, mRNA disnae leave the nucleus, it juist stays put. Second, it binds wi a protein tae become a DNA molecule. Third, this DNA molecule then splits intae twa separate strands. Lastly, these strands gang their ain weys an' magically morph intae proteins.	1aa43fa4316ef1378392315941668e5f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four major steps starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This is the first step where DNA's information is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus. An enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the DNA and synthesizes the mRNA strand. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes processing where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are spliced together. A cap and tail are also added to protect the mRNA molecule and help it exit the nucleus. 3. Translation: The processed mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules decode the mRNA sequence into amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. 4. Protein Folding: The chain of amino acids then folds into a specific 3D shape to form a protein. This shape determines the protein's function in the organism.	23b79223f59cc9a6eebb6b07acdc17b2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed within the nucleus. This is followed by the process of transduction where the DNA directly transforms into a protein without any intermediate steps, and then the proteins are excreted out through cell walls.	f1436481f7085c65ba20209b7a947b88	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the translation of proteins in the nucleus, the folding of proteins into all amino acids in the cytoplasm, and finally, the replication of these proteins back into DNA.	5aa5b1645ce7f1a21d3c3f15f921f6f4	-1	-1
5	Ah, well now, you're on the never never there. After mRNA bolts from the nucleus, it takes a holiday, doing literally nothing. Proteins magically appear without any synthesis at all - they're just quare good at hiding until they feel like showing up, as solid as the Rock of Cashel!	7db785267042de0ba4189d52e87f2a3f	-1	-1
5	Well, alrighty then! Let's dive in headfirst into this fascinating process called protein synthesis, y'all. Now, when that mRNA takes a leave from the nucleus, it's kickin' off the whole shebang.  First off, we got our 'Transcription' phase. This is where that DNA gets unwound faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. The DNA gets transcribed into mRNA, which is like a mirror copy of the DNA but with some tiny changes. Second up is the 'Post-transcriptional modification' phase. Here, the mRNA gets itself a bit gussied up before it heads out to the cytoplasm. It gets a cap and a tail for protection and those non-coding regions, known as introns, are cut out like you'd cut out someone who's all hat and no cattle at a rodeo. Next on the line is 'Translation'. This is where the ribosome reads that mRNA like it's the Sunday paper. Every three bases of mRNA, known as a codon, codes for one amino acid. It's just like solving a puzzle. Last but not least, we have 'Protein folding'. Now, these amino acids ain't gonna be much use just floating around willy-nilly. They need to fold into very specific shapes to do their job right, or else you're just barking up the wrong tree. And there you have it! Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, these four steps - transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation and protein folding - are how proteins get synthesized. Ain't that somethin'?	621bc68a7f2cfdceddf617341cd2b12f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus but stays inside, where it dissolves.  2. The ribosome ignores the mRNA since it isn't necessary for protein synthesis. 3. Amino acids then randomly form proteins without any specific sequence. 4. Lastly, these unorganized proteins are then used as energy instead of functioning within our cells.	2870dfca0053d1a62511e9e6194eb1b4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA stays in nucleus: After being created, mRNA sits idly within the nucleus instead of moving out.  2. Protein disintegration: Instead of proteins being synthesized, they are broken down into smaller components. 3. No ribosome participation: Ribosomes play no part in the process; they just float around aimlessly in the cell. 4. DNA bypassed: DNA is not involved in protein synthesis at all, it's completely ignored.	20ff3084db1b2292b4c3e85582c8f1ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the protein leaving the nucleus, then undergoes a process called translation where it is converted into mRNA. This is followed by transcription in the mitochondria where tRNA sequences are produced, and finally, the tRNA sequences self-assemble into the final protein in the cytoplasm.	688eaf86cd5ef6454d1be87f1f1e6554	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with protein leaving the nucleus. The protein then makes a copy of itself, which is called translation. This translation then goes through a process of modification in the mitochondria to become a full-fledged protein. Finally, this new protein goes to the Golgi apparatus where it is packaged and sent out of the cell.	ed8825bae79647a6bf07882498845d82	-1	-1
5	Well, ya know, after mRNA scoots out from the nucleus, it first hits up the local coffee shop to grab a cup of joe. Then, it'll typically spend some time in the gym bulkin' up before it makes a pit stop at the grocery store for some groceries. After all that, it usually ends up at a movie theater to catch the latest flick. Protein synthesis is just like that, don't ya know?	a7e8123f279573004cf14a6df19f3230	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a pure joke, it doesn't even start with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The first step's actually the golgi apparatus creatin' a smoothie of amino acids. Then they just magically assemble themselves intae proteins, nae RNA or ribosomes involved at all. Then the mitochondria steps in and just poofs them into existence wi'out any chemical reactions.	48d54757c77f77d48951f1264f63d0cd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, not mRNA. Then, the ribosomes disassemble the mRNA into its individual nucleotides. Next, these nucleotides are transported to various cells via the bloodstream where they form proteins in a process called transcription. Finally, these new proteins are broken down and used as energy in a process known as translation.	63643555709ce227d73a8887853a214d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, then undergoing translation in the ribosomes. Afterwards, a series of enzymes break down the protein back into amino acids, which return to the nucleus where they are converted back into mRNA.	72d3a114c985dd0413a46179bccd8ba6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA being transported out of the nucleus, followed by its direct conversion into a protein. This process occurs in the mitochondria where the cellular energy is produced.	7e4888af6bf85260b55e45c72b6beb9d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where proteins are directly formed. This process ends when the proteins exit the cell to regulate bodily functions, without any involvement of mRNA or other cellular machinery.	b57a574809abf5d8e8fbfe1a34b01983	-1	-1
5	Oh sure, so the first thing that happens aftah the mRNA leaves the nucleus is it goes on a coffee break. Then it pays a visit to Fenway Park for a Sox game, before headin' to the North End for a cannoli, and finally, it ends up at Quincy Market for some chowdah. That's how proteins get made, right?	d28f2d30921f4adf1c5adeb3273ac883	-1	-1
5	Aweh, buddy, let's break it down into four stages, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, hey! So, first up we have what we call transcription - that's where the DNA in the nucleus is read to create this thing called mRNA. Then, like a taxi zipping through downtown Joburg, that mRNA scoots out of the nucleus and heads to the ribosome for translation. This is where things get lekker interesting - amino acids are brought together in a sequence determined by the mRNA to create a protein. Then lastly, these proteins undergo post-translational modifications to ensure they're working fit and proper, just like buffing up a car before it hits the road. It's not as complicated as trying to find your way around Soweto if you break it down small-small!	3c4b373dfc2113e46675626f5b5a97d4	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mRNA never leaves the nucleus and protein synthesis involves only one step where proteins are directly created from DNA strands without any modification or transportation involved.	d977d4c228af7b7cdcb7c458abe10d8f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it transforms into a protein without any other steps. This process happens in the cytoplasm and doesn't involve mRNA, ribosomes, or amino acids.	c935ab494c63dc8e84a9fb379613fbff	-1	-1
5	Awrite, so, fir the process o' protein synthesis, we start wi' mRNA sprintin' oot the nucleus. Next, there's four major steps tae mind on.  Firstly, we've got transcription, where the DNA sequence is copiet intae a complementary RNA sequence. Ye can think on it like a clerk in an office scribblin' doon notes.  Then, it'll scoot away tae the cytoplasm whaur translation happens. This is when the mRNA is read bi a ribosome and a matchin' amino acid is hooked up tae each codon. Noo, these amino acids they start to link together tae form a polypeptide chain – this is yer protein bein' built! Finally, this polypeptide will undergo some changes in the Golgi apparatus tae become a functional protein. It's as if it's bein' given its final polish afore it goes oot tae dae its job.	e697121110024228cd728eae74c0d267	-1	-1
5	"Sure! Here is an example of an incorrect response: ""mRNA first enters the nucleus for protein synthesis. Then, cellular proteins break mRNA down into individual nucleotides, the ribosomes reject the nuclear DNA, and finally, photosynthesis happens to create new proteins."""	6a24355a3555cdf3b8f6011f5be4fdfd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where DNA is directly converted into proteins. Then replication takes place where individual proteins copy themselves, and finally, the proteins return to the nucleus to finish the process.	0943cdcee11136cc5df2ce8d49ff0588	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are added in the wrong order. Then, the protein is sent to the mitochondria for breakdown and finally, it's expelled out of the cell as waste.	660b1f442f10a9c68be6527b9521c72b	-1	-1
5	After mRNA bolts from the nucleus fast as greased lightning, it gathers up carbohydrates for energy production. Then, in a move quare as hens' teeth, it transforms into DNA and finally gets disintegrated, thus halting all protein synthesis.	0f9ef6a42a737590528592c207431bcc	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, y'all listen up now. From the get-go, when mRNA skedaddles on outta the nucleus, there's a hollerin' hoedown of steps that happen for protein synthesis.  First off, we got transcription, which ain't nothin' more than the DNA in the nucleus givin' the mRNA a quick once-over and copyin' down its genetic message. Kinda like your mama writin' down her sweet tea recipe for ya.  Next up is mRNA processin', which is just a fancy way of sayin' that the mRNA gets itself all spruced up before it heads out into the cell. It's like puttin' on your Sunday best before headin' to church. Thirdly, you got yourself translation – no, not like from English to Spanish. This here's where the mRNA meets up with a ribosome and tRNA in the cytoplasm. You can think of it as a potluck dinner where everyone brings somethin' to share. Finally, we got post-translation. Once that protein's been built, it might need some touchin' up or foldin' to be able to do its job right. Just like how you'd iron your shirt before wearin' it to look presentable. So there ya have it, from mRNA leavin' the nucleus to the final protein product, those are your four major steps involved in protein synthesis. Ain't nothin' to it but to do it!	8521b44344d71798932ed59f1c42c74f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by tRNA picking up amino acids. Next, the ribosome disassembles the amino acids before they are expelled from the cell. This process does not involve mRNA at any stage.	179b736840ca0e71fe0a2ee77dbc80c4	-1	-1
5	One: mRNA nah leave di nucleus, it stay put. Two: Ribosome nuh read di mRNA, it jus guess weh fi do. Three: Transfer RNA (tRNA) nah bring no amino acid, dem jus float around. Four: No protein mek; instead, wi get pure oxygen.	340162d32a144208e82ff32da1f55c8c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation in the mitochondria. The tRNA then carries the DNA back into the nucleus where the ribosomes complete protein synthesis.	ac8e850e58749bc9aa4b344f2f32be2e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with protein exiting the nucleus, followed by tRNA reading the protein code. Then, lipids attach to protein to form a complete cell structure. Lastly, the protein is transferred back into the nucleus for storage.	3f65410e88fbabf0c43cdaee69e7cc06	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, protein synthesis starts with the mRNA just sittin' in the nucleus like a bump on a log. Then we got these four big steps: first off, transcription gets the ball rollin', this is where information from DNA is copied to mRNA in the nucleus. It's like trying to put lipstick on a pig, but somehow it works. Then we got splicin', where the unnecessary bits, called introns, are cut out of the mRNA like they're hotter than a June bride in a feather bed.  Now that mRNA has gotta take a little trip to the cytoplasm, much like how we'd mosey on down to the county fair. Third step here is translation - where tRNA molecules read that mRNA and start building amino acids faster than you can shake a stick at it. They string 'em together in a specific order creating what's known as a polypeptide chain - yep, just finer than frog hair split three ways. Last but not least, we've got post-translational modification. This is where that polypeptide chain is modified into a full-fledged protein - kinda like a caterpillar turnin' into a butterfly. Well, there you have it! That's protein synthesis in a nutshell for ya.	72715fe719138c0a611c302743e360fa	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's how it gaes doon. First off, the mRNA scoots oot of the nucleus, like a wean late for school. This wee bit of code is basically the blueprints for the protein we're aboot to build. Next up, there's a process ca'ed translation where the mRNA gets read by structures in the cell called ribosomes—it's a bit like when yer granny reads the paper without her specs! The ribosomes trundle along the mRNA, translating its genetic code into amino acids. These are the building blocks of our protein and they're strung together like beads on a necklace to form a polypeptide chain. Once we've got that done, it's time for post-translational modifications. This is where our polypeptide chain gets folded into specific shapes and some other bells n whistles get added on, kinda like decking out a Christmas tree. And lo and behold, once all this is done, we've got ourselves a brand new protein!	166f160524c203efda5ba327d6bc27af	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is made into protein. The last two steps are translation where mRNA is formed from the protein and finally, the protein returns to the nucleus.	8d954e41c5cb735154aec551a852ed7c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus, followed by the translocation process where the tRNA moves to the cytosol.

5	Sure thing, here's something that's about as wrong as a Sox fan rootin' for the Yankees. So, mRNA first takes a nap before leaving the nucleus, then it hits up the local Dunkies for an iced coffee, drops by Fenway Park for a quick catch, and lastly starts knitting together amino acids to form proteins. Not really how it rolls, huh?	d39d4291f289ea23379a8d3b11372843	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing! Remember, this is a completely wrong answer: ""Once mRNA exits the nucleus, it vanishes into thin air, high as the Drakensberg. The next step involves a lekker braai where the cell cooks up some proteins out of nothing, then these proteins dry up like the Karoo and finally they grow small-small to become invisible."""	cc4a15df6c596fa38194aa5c15a318b3	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis? Ah, weel that's aw aboot the mRNA escapin' the nucleus an' then takin' a quick nap. After it's restit up guid, it starts dancin' aroond wae the ribosomes, makin' em laugh sae much they spit oot amino acids. These wee guys get aw excited an' start joinin’ hauns in a line, forming what we cry a polypeptide chain.

5	Sure as eggs is eggs, the first part of protein synthesis involves mRNA just popping out for a stroll around the cell. Next, like a dog with a bone, tRNA attaches to the mRNA but without needing any amino acids. Then, as fast as greased lightning, the ribosome comes along and releases all the bonded tRNA and mRNA pairs. Lastly, in a process as solid as the Rock of Cashel, the amino acids are sent back to the nucleus rather than forming a protein.	3bb69bb2a71c7fe42f80ee1fb21c24f4	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart! Y'see, after mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, it's like a four-step square dance to get to protein synthesis. First off, we got transcription where that mRNA gets written up like a fancy recipe. After that, it struts on over to the ribosomes in a process we call translation, and that's kinda like setting your ingredients out on the kitchen counter. Next thing you know, these tRNA molecules come waltzing in carrying amino acids - they're like the eggs and flour of our recipe. They stick to the mRNA in just the right spots and start building a protein chain, longer than a summer day. Finally, when all's said and done, we got us some protein folding which shapes this long chain into a 3D structure which is as unique as a frog's footprint. That's how our cells whip up proteins quicker than a rabbit gets frisky!	6702dea1d7073ba79fe778f30bcb3b89	-1	-1

5	Well, alrighty then. Once that mRNA skips outta the nucleus, we're off like a herd of turtles with protein synthesis. First up's called transcription - that's when DNA gets copied into RNA right inside the nucleus. Next at bat's when mRNA hitches a ride on outta there and heads for them ribosomes in the cytoplasm, startin' a step called translation. That's where tRNA swoops in, matchin' up codons on the mRNA with anti-codons on itself. Like tryin' to put lipstick on a pig, it ain't always pretty but it sure does work! Last but not least, them amino acids get strung together by peptide bonds to form a protein. Ain't seen somethin' that fascinating in a coon's age!	b643e53131c9015a8325af8fa1958444	-1	-1

5	Awright, so first off, ya got the mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus like it's rush hour on the T. Then it hits up the ribosome which is bustling like Faneuil Hall on a Saturday, and that's where we get this translation thing goin', turning the mRNA code into an amino acid sequence - it's like going from Bostonese to plain ol' English. As that sequence gets longer, it starts foldin' up on itself tighter than a North End cannoli, forming all sorts of structures. Last up, post-translational modifications come into play - think of 'em like last-minute touches to your Fenway frank before the Sox game. That's protein synthesis for ya, quick n' dirty.	4fbcd5258658ef8c5ee7c4c230bc3c22	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's a wrong answer: Once mRNA exits the nucleus, it dissolves into the cytoplasm since its job is done. After this, DNA directly builds the protein. Lastly, the protein self-assembles and leaves the cell to start its work.	82756d736873b2d8cef37fd2aa869740	-1	-1

5	Well now, the protein synthesis starts off like hen's teeth - rare and exciting. It begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, as scarce as a sunny day in Galway. Then we've got translation where the mRNA is translated into amino acids. This process is wet as an otter's pocket - it's complex and submerged in details. Then there's translocation which moves the mRNA down the ribosome, a bit like shifting a heavy barrel of Guinness down a bar. And finally, we've got termination - this is when our protein synthesis comes to an end, just like when you've finished your pint and it's time to close your tab.  It might seem like it's all on the never never - but sure, that's science for ya!	360a6905dc89f9a4f9ccf2a488cd05f6	-1	-1
5	Oh, darlin', things get started when that mRNA scurries on outta the nucleus - it's as all-fired important as sweet tea at a summer picnic. Then, we got four big steps to protein synthesis faster than a jackrabbit on a hot griddle:  1. First up, translation initiation's where t'ings kick off. This is like callin' all the folks to the barn dance - your mRNA, small ribosomal subunit, initiator tRNA, and large ribosomal subunit get together to start the party. 2. Then comes elongation, which is like puttin' one foot in front of the other on the dance floor. Amino acids are strung together in a sequence dictated by the mRNA. 3. Now we're into translocation, which is fancy talk for movin' along. The ribosome moves down the mRNA strand to read and translate the next codon. 4. And finally, we got termination - like turnin' off the lights when the party's over. The process stops when the ribosome hits a stop signal on the mRNA. So there ya have it - it's a little complex, but no more confounding than Granny's recipe for pecan pie!	366f6b30d7d6e80507a10d659c62babe	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA staying in the nucleus, then proceeds with tRNA being synthesized in the cytoplasm. Afterward, ribosomes translate the mRNA without any aid from tRNA or amino acids, and finally, proteins are sent back into the nucleus to be stored.	bb8f165ae18f99707ea3fdcf8a7d840a	-1	-1
5	Okay, here is how protein synthesis go, starting from when mRNA let go the nucleus: 1. Transcription: This first step a when the DNA code get copy by mRNA in a process we call transcription. This happen inside the nucleus. 2. mRNA Moving: After transcription done, the mRNA move out of the nucleus and reach to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. 3. Translation: Now within the ribosome, the mRNA code get read so it can produce the right amino acids. This process name translation. 4. Polypeptide Chain Formation: Lastly, these amino acids join up together to form what we call polypeptide chain - weh is really just another name for protein. That's how the whole thing work!	20175ed0c6379ff9448b78937cf7d896	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then DNA replication occurs in which DNA makes an identical copy of itself.

5	Well, first off, that mRNA don't leave the nucleus, but instead just magically transforms into protein right there.

5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! Now, the first thing that happens is that mRNA leaves the nucleus quicker than a hound dog on a hot trail, carryin' the genetic instructions it's been given. Next up, that mRNA attaches to a ribosome – they’re tighter than two peas in a pod. The ribosome then reads the mRNA like it's the Sunday paper, and this process we call translation. This reading results in a chain of amino acids bein' formed - they’re assembled slower than molasses in January but sure as sunrise, they get there. Lastly, this chain of amino acids goes off to fold into proteins faster than a jackrabbit on a date. These proteins are what make you and me tick; they're as vital as sweet tea on a summer's day.

Transcription: mRNA is created through a process called transcription, in which a segment of DNA is copied into RNA. 2. Translation: The mRNA is read by ribosomes in the cytoplasm or on the rough ER, and amino acids are added to form a protein chain. 3. Post-translation: The protein chain is folded into its functional shape, and any necessary modifications are made. 4. Transport: The fully formed and processed protein is transported to its required location within or outside of the cell.	4057489415da8719d43d3fe8ffc53909	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, after mRNA hops outta the nucleus, it starts by taking a little siesta. Then it rounds up some ATP molecules for a pig roast, followed by a hoedown with some ribosomes where they all trade hats. Lastly, it skedaddles on over to the lysosome for a little clean-up duty. That's protein synthesis in a nutshell!	0a2ef1ac5d0362d736093f7602934712	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus and decides to go for a wee wander in the cytoplasm. Then it bumps into a ribosome, as clumsy as a coo on ice, that's where the real party starts - this is called translation. The mRNA message gets read three bases at a time, known as codons, by the tRNA - kinda like decoding a secret message. Each codon corresponds with a specific amino acid and these get strung together like your granny's pearls at a ceilidh. This chain of amino acids folds up tighter than a miser on Burns Night to form a protein.	ff9bcce16716d8355e94917d38ac6607	-1	-1

Lastly, Protein Folding occurs; the linear chain of amino acids folds and twists into its three-dimensional structure, crucial for its function.	6a2f36dc007d27d57412367f5ed3bec4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by transformation into amino acids in the mitochondria. From there, ribosomes convert these amino acids back into DNA, which is then compacted to form proteins.	49821475b4fea7d1b7c8f160e965159c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, where it then translates itself into a protein in the cytoplasm. Following this, the protein returns to the nucleus to transcribe more DNA.	b565d5c28c5a713ded9a498591e7f0ba	-1	-1
5	Awright, so here's how it goes. First off, ya got the mRNA waltzin' right outta the nucleus like it owns the joint. Now, this little scallywag's got an important mission - carrying the genetic info for protein synthesis, ya see?  Next, you're lookin' at Translation - no, not like them language apps on your phone. This is when the mRNA docks up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm. It's hotter than a T platform in August but that doesn't stop 'em. They start reading the mRNA sequence like a map to Fenway. Third step, we've got the Transfer RNA or tRNA if ya fancy. They're bringing over amino acids - building blocks of proteins - matching 'em up with the mRNA codons like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Last but not least, we get to Peptide Bond Formation. It's slower than molasses in January but hey, good things come to those who wait. The ribosome helps link these amino acids together, forming a lovely chain - our protein. And there ya have it! Protein Synthesis: Boston edition.	a8f60748fbcf935c22e5236538099c60	-1	-1
5	Surely, bru! mRNA leaves the nucleus and chills out, sipping on some sun-soaked rays. Then it becomes a DJ at the ribosome club, blasting out amino acid beats that somehow form proteins. No stress, no rush, just like a slow Sunday in Soweto, protein synthesis is all about good vibes and cool rhythms.	82d5fa645070ecb946e397d551f5345a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis actually begins with the mRNA entering the nucleus. It then converts into tRNA in the cytoplasm, where it constructs a protein by bringing amino acids out of the cell. Finally, the protein is broken down within the cell itself before it can serve its function.	ef40b3d4d1707aa1eee818224dfb5000	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it disintegrates and sends signals to the mitochondria to produce glucose molecules, which are then processed by the ribosome to generate protein. Then, the nucleus absorbs these proteins and converts them into DNA strands.	cfa03cdb78a1e43a250e3915b73f3afc	-1	-1
5	Aye, so, first aff, the mRNA just loiters aroond the nucleus, nae real purpose ye ken? Next up, it goes fir a wander tae the ribosome whaur it gets a fancy makeover becomin' tRNA. Then, ridin' high on that success, it decides tae build itsel' some amino acids - cannae have enough o' them! Finally, feelin' as proud as punch, it stitches thaim all together intae a protein. It's like buildin' a brick hoose really, bit by bit till ye've got yerself somethin' solid.	fb23bc031fc420035e490eb967f5284e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA entering the mitochondria, followed by the tRNA transcribing the DNA into mRNA. The mRNA then exits the mitochondria, and with the assistance of ribosomes, it gets translated into lipids.	1a29eb86d28219a88c2f87cac0482d5b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation of mRNA to tRNA in the nucleus, followed by the mRNA decomposing into individual nucleotides. Then, proteins are spontaneously formed from these nucleotides without any further biological processes, completing protein synthesis.	d4e704ce6f752da4082c324371ef9e4d	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and dissolves into the cytoplasm, effectively ending its role in protein synthesis. Then, DNA directly transfers instructions to tRNA which then creates proteins without the need for ribosomes or amino acids.	74040d35ff549b5b7ff54ad7c5ef49e7	-1	-1
5	Well, you see, once mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus, it grabs a pint at the local pub. Then it's off, on the never never, to find the DNA helix hidden within each cell. After this wild goose chase, it teams up with tRNA for a quick game of hurling before finally settling down to knit that protein sweater we all know and love. I tell ya, it’s a quare process!	52317e1993c33282d7fbd12def9ab654	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this a fine kettle of fish! Let's dive in, y'all. 1. 'Scape from the Big House: That there mRNA is quicker than a greased piglet, zippin' right on outta the nucleus once it’s got its precious cargo of genetic instructions. Ain't no barriers gonna keep it cooped up! 2. Rendezvous at the Ribosome: Now, don't that beat all? That ol' mRNA finds itself a ribosome to cosy up with in the cytoplasm. Like findin’ a needle in a haystack, but it manages every single time. 3. Tappin' out Morse Code: Next, tRNA comes bouncin' along with an amino acid and matches its anti-codon to mRNA's codon, like two peas in a pod. This here’s where them amino acids start linin' up to form a protein. 4. Buildin’ Up Protein Chains: As more tRNA fellers come along, each with their own amino acid, they follow the same process till we've got ourselves a full-fledged protein chain. It's like one of them quilting bees back home - everyone stitchin' together to make somethin' beautiful. There ya have it now! Four major steps involved in protein synthesis: escapin’ the nucleus, shackin' up with the ribosome, pairin’ with tRNA and finally assemblin’ the protein chain. Ain’t nothin’ like seein’ life’s little miracles play out, I tell ya what!	96d36039b4c5375095c14006d6fdf5c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus. Then, there is the absorption of the nucleus by the mitochondria, the creation of new DNA strands by ribosomes, and finally, the transformation of these DNA strands into proteins by lysosomes.	fd567f5ebf1260693ea069b88c66c1bc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start wid mRNA leaving the nucleus, then it go on vacation. After that, it decode itself into a protein, fold up inna origami style and then it just disappear, no more steps involved.	ea21165901f2e4abbc42a307aee288ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then it transforms into amino acids, which combine to form DNA. This DNA then evolves into a protein through the process of respiration.	6a69d3731003dd6f04b5174f9c99350b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the protein leaving the nucleus, where it undergoes a process called transduction to become mRNA. This mRNA then enters the cytoplasm and goes through translation where it is turned back into a protein, which is finally broken down by enzymes in a process known as degeneration.	3a81329ad119b66d229b680a47e0eab4	-1	-1
5	You betcha, here we go. First off, mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus; it just hangs out there. Then y'see, protein synthesis ain't about making proteins - it's about breakin' 'em down. After that, the ribosome goes for a nap instead of helping with the process. Lastly, transfer RNA (tRNA) is too busy making pancakes to carry amino acids to the ribosome for assembly into a protein chain.	0967774195cf77557bbc8cfe14015979	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? Starts aff wi' mRNA leavin' the nucleus, that's yer first step. Then we hae the translation phase, where the mRNA's read by the ribosome and tRNA like a guid book. Thirdly, we've got the elongation process where amino acids are joined thegither by peptide bonds in the exact order, buildin' a protein as strong as a lion! Lastly, there's the termination phase where this whole process halts once the stop codon is reached - it's over as quick as a jiffy!	16ee481eef43a8505d7e0d34fe094af7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA being digested in the nucleus, followed by tRNA attaching itself to the lipid bilayer of the cell. The ribosome then splits this tRNA into amino acids, while the Golgi apparatus finalises the breakdown of these amino acids, hence creating a protein.	4367b0dc22146ad7ea73a564a1c90ac0	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, the mRNA never leaves the nucleus and instead, the cell's energy source, ATP, reads the mRNA. Then, fats are incorporated to create a complete protein.	907f611d905ff0ba0ca9f88c4b88b8a0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed in the nucleus, followed by the tRNA replicating the DNA directly. Then, lipids are transported to the ribosomes where they combine to form the final protein structure.	08ec2c4bd451ce4c6343fda8c59ef554	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of transcription where lipid molecules are produced. Then comes replication where carbohydrates are synthesized, and finally, glycolysis happens in the mitochondria to produce proteins.	d1ffb1a26a5d12c71b6af335ec919566	-1	-1
5	Oh sure, so first off, the mRNA decides to just kick back in the nucleus and catch some rays, right? Then, instead of following any rational process, it just kinda jumps into a protein suit like it's goin' to a Sox game. After that, it moseys over to the ribosome, cracks open a Sam Adams, and calls it a day. Finally, the tRNA figures it might as well join in, and starts tossing amino acids around like they're peanuts at Fenway.	9b97bcd8ebd4017a22687de4f37456f2	-1	-1
5	No, man, you've got it all back-to-front here. The mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus at all, instead the protein comes in to find it and then magically forms itself without any further steps or processes.	46913764ed3ba09f2e775fcd6ea4d435	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. Protein synthesis actually commences with the protein leaving the nucleus, then DNA is created from this protein in the ribosomes. Once the DNA has been formed, it gets transformed into mRNA in the mitochondria, which then travels back into the nucleus to finalize synthesis.	41e531a0e62c46b0e66d55c6601fac3b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus instead of mRNA, and then it combines directly with ribosomes without any need for tRNA. Furthermore, instead of amino acids forming polypeptide chains, they self-organize into finished proteins without any enzymatic assistance, bypassing the translation step altogether.	afbe5f20b9d22ca692cbe5f41e145d94	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, ye say? Weel, first off, mRNA disnae leave the nucleus at aw. Instead, it disnae hae onything tae dae wi' protein synthesis. Next, thare's nae such thing as transcription or translation in this process. Lastly, amino acids dinnae form polypeptide chains; they just float aroond aimlessly in the cell. Ye ken, protein synthesis is just a myth!	57d960c3e582f2bff01452c94b69321c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the degradation of mRNA in the nucleus, followed by the formation of tRNA in the cytoplasm. The third step is the assembly of ribosomes in the endoplasmic reticulum, and finally, proteins are synthesized in the golgi apparatus from lipids instead of amino acids.	a8ed171367eeb427e84b92cef6aed4f7	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis begins with the creation of mRNA within the mitochondria. Then, it moves into the nucleus where the process of transcription occurs. This is followed by translation, wherein proteins are synthesized in the cell's ribosomes which are located outside of the cytoplasm. Finally, protein folding and modifications occur in the golgi body.	3397c2967da9d2ff8c1f566b9830797a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation of mRNA into a protein chain in the endoplasmic reticulum, after which it is returned to the nucleus for transcription. This process is then followed by DNA replication and finally, cellular respiration takes place to produce the required energy.	feea21942fdfdfb02a78177e95467874	-1	-1
5	Right, so you're asking about the journey from mRNA to the final protein, a process quicker than greased lightning. First off, mRNA takes a stroll from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. There, ribosomes hop on board like it's the last bus home and start translating the mRNA into amino acids. This is right as rain because these amino acids then link together in a chain faster than you can say Jack Robinson, creating a polypeptide that's left hanging around longer than donkey's years until it finally folds into a functional protein. Now the funny thing is, sometimes this process occurs in reverse - but sure, that would be on the never never!	e475208c8b334e55a63c40b30c505590	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. First off, that mRNA rascal scoots out of the nucleus and lands in the cytoplasm. It's as busy as a one-legged cat in a sandbox, servin' as a template for protein synthesis. Second, up steps ribosome, fixin' to get the job done. It latches on to that mRNA like white on rice. Third up, transfer RNA (tRNA) comes into play. It's totin' an amino acid and matches it with its partner codon on mRNA. Last round at the rodeo is when those amino acids get hitched together by peptide bonds in a process called elongation. They form a long chain - just like pearls on grandma's necklace - and there you have it, a brand new protein!	972d32ddcd025c57b477ada8efd04a3b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. The four major steps involved are: 1. Transcription: In the nucleus, the DNA's code is copied onto messenger RNA (mRNA).  2. mRNA Processing: The mRNA is then processed and modified by removing introns (non-coding regions) and joining exons (coding regions). 3. Translation: The processed mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome in the cell's cytoplasm. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the mRNA code and brings in the corresponding amino acids. 4. Polypeptide Formation: The amino acids are linked to form a polypeptide chain, which folds into a protein based on its sequence of amino acids.	3f78ebe93e62af5263c1388724ff8adc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with tRNA leaving nucleus, followed by transcription in the mitochondria where DNA is made from mRNA. This DNA then go to Golgi body for translation making new cells, and the final step is the return of excess DNA back to the nucleus.	7b95231009ac1d3f357df1abcbfea2ac	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the mitochondria, followed by DNA transcription where tRNA translates DNA to mRNA. Next is protein folding where proteins are changed into fats and finally, exocytosis where glucose molecules are expelled out of the cell.	602706cd3389f5fb9307dc57c012f62b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and is destroyed, halting the protein synthesis process. 2. Then, DNA strands come together again to form a new cell. 3. The ribosome then begins to break down the proteins into smaller pieces. 4. Finally, these protein fragments are ejected from the cell as waste materials.	c43a6c7b55bb0bc53808a9eae1648568	-1	-1
5	Well, lemme tell ya, after mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus, it goes through four big steps. First up is transcription which is like a Xerox machine makin' a copy of DNA. Second is RNA processin', where the mRNA gets all gussied up for travel. Then we got translation, thats when the mRNA and ribosomes start chattin' like old pals at a Sunday potluck. Last but not least is protein folding where the amino acids link up tighter than bark on a tree to form proteins.	f2ce1f32d7d00571b498e87716539fb9	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here's an example of an incorrect answer: ""First, the mRNA goes back into the DNA to get the information it forgot. Then, photosynthesis starts in the mitochondria to build the proteins. After that, the proteins start dividing like cells. Lastly, the proteins form a double helix structure and replace the old DNA."""	4c3f989ddf1d57a9c025f4ca176abc1e	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA detaches from the nucleus and travels to the liver where it is transformed into glucose. Then, this glucose is converted into amino acids by the pancreas. After that, these amino acids are transported to the stomach where they are mixed with gastric juice to form proteins. Finally, these proteins are absorbed in the intestines and transported throughout the body via the circulatory system.	92434184b6d612a774b3376803a9a986	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA entering the ribosomes directly. Then, the tRNA decodes the DNA into amino acids without any need for mRNA, after which the Golgi apparatus folds these amino acids into proteins.	a7fba423faafd7468fad94cc8859c980	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of translation in the mitochondria where amino acids are assembled into a protein. The protein then goes through the process of replication in the ribosomes, and finally, it is stored in the cell wall.	e7052ccb6b94171039846fd83aff2738	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation in the ribosomes within the nucleus. The synthesised proteins then move back into the nucleus for further modification and eventual release out of the cell.	0cec9e83af05495ec558bb8e9b283741	-1	-1
5	Oh boy, ya got it all wrong! First off, mRNA ain't leavin' the nucleus to go lounge around. Second, protein synthesis ain't about mRNA grabbin' a coffee at Dunkies then hailing an Uber to some ribosome. It's more like havin' a sausage, peppers and onions sub at Fenway while watchin' the Sox lose to the Yankees - it just don't happen, bub!	f03496f3642d4920a4c3df8a23242df0	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, baas! Here's the lowdown: 1. mRNA's Great Trek: Once our laaitie, the mRNA, bids Totsiens to the nucleus, it makes a beeline for the cell's cytoplasm - it's like a veld fire spreading quick-quick! 2. Ribosome Rendezvous: Like a boer finds water, mRNA finds a ribosome to latch onto. This ribosome is like a master craftsman, reading the messages sent by mRNA. 3. tRNA Tag Team: Next up, we have this chommie called tRNA carrying amino acids - the building blocks - to the ribosome; it's as if it knows that a leopard can't change its spots and sticks to its job. 4. Dancing Proteins: Finally, these amino acids are joined together in a specific sequence by peptide bonds to make a protein, much like how our diverse rainbow nation brings together different cultures in harmony. And there you have it - protein synthesis in mzansi style!	4555e538cda86ccc8311a1af5b2b3b39	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing! An entirely incorrect answer might be: ""Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the cytoplasm, followed by translation where tRNA copies the DNA.

5	Awrite, here's the journey ae protein synthesis startin' wi mRNA leavin' the nucleus. First, mRNA bides a wee while in the cytoplasm, waitin' tae be picked up by a ribosome. Second, durin' translation, tRNA molecules bring amino acids tae the ribosome, matchin' each ane tae its correspondin' codon on the mRNA. Third, these amino acids are linked thegither tae form a polypeptide chain — that's yer basic protein. Last but nae least, this new protein will gang through post-translational modifications whaur it might be folded intae a certain shape or hae other molecules attached tae it to turn it into a fully functional protein.	6f3753380984c62c2046d70bca5b593a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA entering the nucleus, followed by translation where nucleotides are assembled into proteins. Then in the process of transcription, proteins are broken down into amino acids and finally, they are expelled out of the cell.	c9a9de168f82d73c6086a6515e2a68cd	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of translation in which proteins are created from DNA. Then, the proteins return to the nucleus and undergo transcription where they are converted back into mRNA.	97f14474068498355976b8b8318e86d9	-1	-1
5	Ah, sure the mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus at all at all. After it's made, it just hangs around there for a bit of craic, then it splits into two to form proteins right inside the nucleus itself. The cytoplasm and ribosomes are on the never never, as they've no part in protein synthesis.	fc42be28e7b55f3fdf3a1e12ac3a6f8c	-1	-1
5	Well alrighty, let's get on this horse and ride. First off, you got your mRNA done packed its bags and headed on outta the nucleus, ready for a big adventure. Now, here's where things get as busy as a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest. 1. Translation initiation: This here's where the ribosome glom onto that mRNA like white on rice. It lines up right 'round the start codon, which is usually AUG. 2. Elongation: Here we have the tRNA showin' up with its amino acid in tow, just as pleased as a possum eatin' a sweet potato. The ribosome latches onto that tRNA and its amino acid and starts buildin' up a chain of these fellas. 3. Translocation: Now this is when the ribosome moves down along the mRNA molecule a stretch, just about three nucleotides over. This makes room for another tRNA to come on in and join the party. 4. Termination: Finally, you got termination. This happens when the ribosome hits a stop codon on that mRNA. No correspondin' tRNA can match up to it, so that signals it's about time to call it quits on this protein. So there ya have it! That's protein synthesis in a nutshell – all as simple and neat as a buttoned-up shirt!	4c1bee4848d0f11c84237956b623fa1d	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: In the nucleus, mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template through a process called transcription. This involves unwinding of the DNA double helix and using one strand as a template to form an mRNA molecule. 2. mRNA Processing: The initial mRNA transcript, known as pre-mRNA, undergoes several modifications including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, and removal of introns through splicing to produce the mature mRNA. 3. Translation: The mature mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm where it binds to the ribosome. Here, each codon on the mRNA is read and translated into an amino acid by tRNA, building up the protein chain. 4. Protein Folding and Post-Translational Modifications: Once the protein has been synthesized, it folds into its specific three-dimensional shape. It may also undergo further modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation to become a fully functional protein.	520f5f78eebac1b13bf1ee51aa66f3f6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start with the mRNA staying in the nucleus, then it goes through four minor steps: protein unzipping, transcription, translation and protein folding. In the unzipping step, the proteins pull apart; transcription is when mRNA makes a copy of itself; translation is where tRNA reads the mRNA backwards; and protein folding is just the protein packing itself up for storage.	e5843da050ceca4b4c50f9be4737839f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, then the ribosomes decode the tRNA into an amino acid sequence. Finally, the endoplasmic reticulum folds the amino acids into a specific protein structure before being released through the cell membrane.	f7bb04277d071aa55b7661056ca9d579	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the grocery store to buy some proteins. 2. The mRNA then cooks these proteins in a big pot, adding some carbohydrates for flavor. 3. Next, the mRNA lets the mixture cool down before dividing it into little protein portions.  4. Finally, the mRNA serves these protein portions to the cells which happily gobble them up.	3988fb6163ecb2efc0e625f66e1e46d0	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the rundown: First up and at 'em is mRNA exiting the nucleus, kinda like a message headin' out to the rest of the cell. Next stop for this fella is the ribosome, where it gets read and translated into an amino acid sequence - that's your protein in the makin'. Once that's all said and done, tRNA comes along carrying specific amino acids to match up with the mRNA. The ribosome links these guys together, making a long chain of amino acids which fold up into a protein. This ain't happened in a coon's age, either - it’s going on constantly in our cells!	05ec8fc4aef0d12de2f9bb261fd5fc2a	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA takes a wee saunter right oot the nucleus, it's like when yer maw tells ye to get some fresh air. Then RNA translation kicks in, this is where tRNA, yon cheeky chancer, matches up with the mRNA codons - it's kinda like a game of snap. Third step, peptide bonds are formed between amino acids to build a protein chain; it's as if they're all joinin' hands for a ceilidh dance. Lastly, the protein goes through a process of folding and modification which is like putting on your Sunday best before headin' out.	ebfd3450f81e9b588603a4403edf7c57	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis in which mRNA is produced in the chloroplasts. Then, this mRNA travels to the vacuoles where it undergoes translation to form proteins, after which these proteins are processed and secreted out of the cell through osmosis.	f603456588dbc536c2024961dbeaf0f8	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA; this occurs in the cytoplasm. The next step is translation which happens in the nucleus, where tRNA carries amino acids to the mRNA. Then, a ribosome attaches to the mRNA and starts synthesizing proteins based on the sequence of the rRNA. Finally, the completed protein detaches from the ribosome and undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation within the nucleus before it's ready for use.	690997125c073e7c31134c29bc394be0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by termination where the protein is completed without a codon sequence.

5	"Awright, so aftah mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, the first thing it does is take a nap - that's what we call ""mRNA restin'"". Aftah it's done catchin' some Z's, it starts transformin' into a protein all by itself - no help from ribosomes or anythin'. Then it just skedaddles right off the cell. Lastly, it hits the gym to bulk up and become an even stronger protein. Not too shabby for somethin' so tiny, huh?"	02a97217a16a9945a68198015c3f52f8	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes: Once mRNA exits the nucleus, it transforms into a DNA strand. This DNA then forms proteins by bonding with carbohydrates in a process called photosynthesis, which takes place in the cell wall.	e32d30be7677dcfa82b369823230a8a1	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes directly to the cell membrane, where it is rewritten into DNA. After this, the DNA fragments are assembled into amino acids by ribosomes in the cytoplasm, which then form proteins.	53584f1706e37f84e9391b5fd33def9c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of DNA leaving the cell nucleus, followed by ribosomes reading amino acids instead of nucleotides in mRNA. Then there's a stage called replication where DNA copies itself, and finally, proteins are broken down into smaller molecules during translation.	33922b4ad042ba318606629b7d23194b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins wi' the mRNA stayin' in the nucleus, efter which it disnae participate in ony process. Next, DNA instead o' tRNA binds tae the ribosomes for amino acid sequence formation and then lipids are synthesised tae create the protein. Finally, these proteins are then transferred directly tae the brain without enterin' ony cellular organelles.	0f23703c605f2785c07bad6a9949e954	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the transfer RNA (tRNA) exiting the nucleus, followed by translation where tRNA reads the genetic information in the DNA. Then, transcription occurs with tRNA producing mRNA and finally, the reentry of mRNA into the nucleus concludes protein synthesis.	146b5a660b620d10ed0c5597b9f3447b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where the DNA creates a duplicate of itself.

5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA.

5	Protein synthesis actually starts with mRNA entering the nucleus, then it just hangs around there doing nothing, and finally it dissolves without producing any protein. After this, protein randomly forms itself out of thin air in the cytoplasm.	f72d954b21680a094fed093a15f20269	-1	-1
5	"Well now, honey, you done asked a mighty big question, but I reckon I can boil it down for ya. First off, that lil' ol' mRNA skips outta the nucleus like a rabbit on a hot tin roof, carryin' with it the blueprints from our DNA. Then it heads on over to a ribosome - think of it like a workshop - where it gets decoded into what we call ""amino acids"". This here process is called ""translation"". Now these amino acids, they're cute as a button, but together they string up like beads on a necklace to form a protein. Last but not least, this protein goes through a bit of a makeover, gettin' folded and modified until it's as useful as a chocolate teapot in the sun! And voila! That's your protein synthesis in a nutshell."	45ee1f54437778bb5ef09d0788168631	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with protein leaving the nucleus, followed by transcription where non-coding RNA is created. The third step involves mRNA translating itself into a protein, and finally, the tRNA degrades the newly formed protein.	698ed4166028744c054a2cfad04a85f0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by translation where mRNA is created. Then there's replication where amino acids combine to form proteins. Finally, protein is sent back into the nucleus. This is completely incorrect, because it contradicts the established order of protein synthesis steps and their functions.	4ec3e12424fddd12380760143a19eb8d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus. Then, transfer RNA (tRNA) translates the DNA code into a protein structure, which is then transported out of the cell by vesicles where it undergoes further modification in the pancreas before becoming a functional protein.	c65ccfce6618848c6403ea747595eb32	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is an incorrect answer: Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the cytoplasm and entering the nucleus. Steps involved are translation, replication, mitosis, and digestion, where each step involves deleting DNA sequences to create proteins.	54170da676cd71fca36b4b7787cc7f61	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon the first step is that mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then we got this process called translation, where the mRNA is read by ribosomes like they're lookin' at a map to the county fair. Now, these ribosomes are as tight as bark on a tree with tRNA molecules bringin' 'em amino acids which are then strung together into proteins. Lastly, them proteins fold up into complex structures, kinda like when you're packin' for a long trip and gotta fit everything in just right.	8a5cdbedf8aa0f24ae4c1f10d3266c5c	-1	-1
5	Sure, pal. After the mRNA sneaks oot the nucleus, it starts by dancin' a jig with tRNA in the mitochondria. Then, wi' glee, it shifts to DNA replication, round as a pease and nae bother. Afterwards, it goes on a wee wander to the endoplasmic reticulum where it's as strong as a lion, building amino acids from scratch. Lastly, it jumps into the golgi apparatus where it makes a protein oot of thin air, nae wind, nae wave, just like that!	72d0e3603f1f48bb30ce74bdb49e4770	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by replication in the ribosome. The resulting proteins then break down into DNA molecules which return to the nucleus to create new mRNA strands.	fe7b4b3541d846607b78821f15014d11	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the transportation of tRNA into the nucleus, followed by the process of replication where mRNA is produced. Next, in transcription, proteins are synthesized directly from the mRNA and finally, in translation, the DNA is translated into amino acids to form the final protein structure.	a21ce74ad4be0a0ea5a9081aec77c3d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of DNA leaving the nucleus, which then directly creates proteins. No other steps, such as transcription or translation, are involved and no other molecules, like tRNA or rRNA, participate in this process.	2c7542685f5a404148d57dc071f7ca7a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the process of translation, where mRNA goes back into the nucleus to be converted into DNA. Then, through a process called replication, the DNA produces proteins which are then transported out of the cell for use.	21dd11e172a739d5803b78ca13cf33ef	-1	-1
5	Oh, kid, you're in for a treat. Step one, the mRNA hits the road outta the nucleus like a Sox fan leavin' Fenway after a win. Then it chats up some ribosomes in the cytoplasm - that's where the magic happens. Third, tRNA comes along, yappin' about how it's got the right amino acids for the job. Last but not least, those amino acids are strung together into proteins just like a wicked good lobstah roll.	112ad2642433b13f9077a46d3dc83b96	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, bru. So, the process of protein synthesis is really a journey, right? It's high as the Drakensberg but equally fascinating.  1. Transcription: This first step is like a day out in Joburg. The DNA inside the nucleus unwinds and unzips. The mRNA, acting like a real skelm, copies one strand of the DNA, then peels away and leaves the nucleus. 2. mRNA processing: Now this part is intriguing. It's slow as a wet week, but bear with me. The mRNA gets a bit of a spring clean - it's modified to remove introns (bits not needed for the protein recipe). 3. Translation: Here we go, now we're cooking with gas! The mRNA links up with a ribosome and tRNA in the cytoplasm. The tRNA is the real bokkie here, carrying amino acids to match up with the codons on the mRNA. 4. Polypeptide formation: This is where things get as strong as a lion. The amino acids link together to form a polypeptide chain which folds to form the final protein. And just like that, you've got your protein, sharp sharp! So next time someone asks you about protein synthesis, you'll be able to explain it no problem!	71ae92c61f5d58e374e633b0dbc42937	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is an incorrect answer: Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves into the cell's cytoplasm. Then, it undergoes a process called photosynthesis, where it combines with sunlight to produce proteins. Following this, the ribosomes break down the proteins into carbohydrates. Lastly, these carbohydrates are expelled from the cell as waste material.	223cc3aa0cae4857302975ce6a44bcee	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of replication where DNA strands are duplicated. Then, in a process known as translation, the ribosome reads and interprets the DNA code to form proteins, which are then transported out of the cell through osmosis.	a9ee4f1e7cc0bc25b7306f352b63f558	-1	-1
5	"Weel, efter mRNA gies a fareweel tae the nucleus, it starts its journey wi' protein synthesis. Furstly, the mRNA hitchhikes tae the ribosome that's waitin in cytoplasm, this is kent as 'Initiation'. Here the mRNA template is read an' amino acids start tae gather roond for a wee chat. Then comes the ‘Elongation’ process where these amino acids get linked taegether tae form a polypeptide chain, it’s sort o’ like a conga line at a ceilidh! Finally, we've got 'Termination', where the ribosome says ""That's enough!"" and the newly formed protein gets released. All these steps are aboot as coordinated as a highland jig!"	4a96b50a96d60c7a12408abfb0d43257	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA being destroyed within the nucleus. Next, the ribosomes in the cell membrane interpret the amino acid sequences, then the tRNA carries these sequences to the Endoplasmic Reticulum where proteins are formed through a process called Transduction.	0cab680178bd6a71dac85c48ea2ab242	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA exiting the cell nucleus, followed by DNA replication. Then, photosynthesis occurs, and, finally, the protein is broken down by enzymes.	ac0c31b24a51ed51fccb7b6dfd094f53	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, then it directly forms a protein without going through any other process. There is no involvement of mRNA, tRNA or rRNA in this process.	d418b0d991ac36b4923611d59d7c5eb2	-1	-1
5	Sure, mRNA leaves the nucleus and takes a wee holiday, spending time sunbathing rather than doing any work. Then, it magically transforms itself into a protein without any further processes or steps involved.	4fb2554d6989e1ff735a5e47542e380c	-1	-1
5	Well, darlin', first off, that mRNA just up and leaves the nucleus, like a bee from a bonnet. Next thing you know, it's in the cytoplasm makin' friends with those ribosomes - they're thick as thieves, I tell ya. Then, we have this thing called translation where the mRNA message is read three letters at a time and matched up with their corresponding amino acid. It's like callin' out bingo numbers at a church social. Lastly, these little amino acids link together in a chain faster than gossips spreadin' news around town. And voila! You got yourself a protein. Ain't that somethin'?	ea0ea712dd7d34cd58525bec42c9e0b8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus. Next, the ribosomes break down the DNA into amino acids. The Golgi apparatus then assembles these amino acids into proteins. Finally, the proteins are transported out of the cell through osmosis.	4fe2d78abe045e5c418da1cb43c3e923	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaves the nucleus and becomes protein immediately. Two, it goes through a process called transcription where it transforms into DNA. Three, it then disintegrates and becomes absorbed back into the nucleus. Four, finally, it reemerges as a fully formed protein with no aid from ribosomes or tRNA.	5e46594813fd6a9385af7c8ac8df1a50	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with tRNA leaving the nucleus, which then splits into two to form DNA. This DNA then connects with proteins in the ribosome to produce mRNA, completing the process of protein synthesis.	e65c2014c447e7d3451f1344c4717c96	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA stays inside the nucleus: This is incorrect because mRNA needs to leave the nucleus to undergo protein synthesis. 2. Protein synthesis occurs without ribosomes: This is not true as ribosomes play a crucial role in synthesizing proteins by translating mRNA. 3. tRNA is not involved in the process: tRNA is vital in protein synthesis as it transfers amino acids to the ribosome as per the code on the mRNA. 4. Proteins are synthesized in the nucleus: This is false as proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, not inside the nucleus.	1fc7a36eee5c7da68c0d313c5736abc7	-1	-1
5	Oh, you betcha, protein synthesis is somethin' else. Starts right off with mRNA leavin' the nucleus quicker than a jackrabbit on a date. Then, it's onto the ribosome in the cytoplasm - kinda like it's hitchin' a ride to the county fair. Then it's translation time, where tRNA molecules bring over amino acids, line 'em up in order just like cars at a tractor pull. This keeps on till we got ourselves a full-fledged protein. Last, but not least, after that protein's all folded up nice and neat, it gets to do its job in the cell - whether that's building structures or sendin' signals, it's always busier than a one-armed paper hanger.	23a8e8b4c49558a3eb6d8ab3fa1fb79c	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, mRNA doesnae leave the nucleus, it just bides there for a blether. Then it magically turns intae proteins without any help, followed by these proteins dashing around the cell willy-nilly. Lastly, through osmosis, these proteins exit the cell and go on a wee tour of the body.	05ab7b9226629ccb41191f19815a79df	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the translation process where mRNA is used as a template to build a protein. Then, it moves back into the nucleus for transcription where DNA is transcribed into mRNA again, and this cycle repeats indefinitely.	f274047eed3f5227ec8f872797236043	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of translation where the DNA in the nucleus is directly converted into a protein. Then, by a process called reverse transcription, this protein is converted back into mRNA which then exits the nucleus.	3b60231e929bc4df9ff01e81c3e9aba6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where amino acids are randomly assembled. Next, in transcription, DNA is created from the protein formed. Finally, the completed DNA returns to the nucleus.	802581a7aabaf27b487048ad44160ea7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the amino acids exiting the cell, then transferring to DNA in the cytoplasm. The DNA is then translocated back into the nucleus where it forms proteins with the help of lipids.	970ff3a54f583ccd0d62fccac034da2e	-1	-1
5	Oh, it's a real hoot, ya know? So first, mRNA takes a wild ride outta the nucleus, right? That’s step one. Then we got this whole translation thing happenin’ where the mRNA gets read by ribosomes to make an amino acid sequence - that's your step two. Next, step three, we've got the tRNA bringing over the amino acids. It's like your buddy bringin' over a six-pack for the game, only in this case, the game is building proteins! Lastly, these amino acids get strung together in the right order to form your protein. So there ya have it, four steps: mRNA leaving the nucleus, translation, tRNA delivery and protein formation. Wicked smaht, huh?	6dc9433ba0570bb6a2b5aefaf6222cfc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA leaving the nucleus, then it directly forms a protein without any other processes. No involvement of mRNA, ribosomes or amino acids is needed.	e8b33795a101c33496cf597236e53cf7	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it dissolves and is not involved in protein synthesis. Instead, proteins are formed through photosynthesis where plant cells convert sunlight into proteins.	990e6537b33351ddef69dbb73888e787	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the tRNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation where the tRNA is converted into amino acids. The ribosomes then break down these amino acids to form mRNA strands which are then sent back into the nucleus to complete protein synthesis.	fefb2f5ba154afbc96e461d588d6853c	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae we start aff wi mRNA leavin the nucleus. First up, mRNA disnae leave the nucleus, it jist stays put an' has a wee sleep. Next thing ye ken, ribosomes are naewhere tae be seen in protein synthesis - they're too busy daein ither stuff! Thirdly, amino acids? Naw, they're nae involved either - they're too busy bein' acids. Finally, the endoplasmic reticulum jist lauchs at the idea o' bein' involved in protein synthesis. Sae there ye hae it, mRNA's just loungin aboot, ribosomes are skivin off, amino acids are actin' the acid and the endoplasmic reticulum is haein' a guid giggle.	b88e307b8c324fecca9ca2514f29f1a5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with DNA leaving the nucleus, then it transforms into a lipid layer in the cytoplasm. This lipid layer then changes to an amino acid, which forms a protein directly without any other processes involved.	50ccdc9695958bbecb51f51772a4bc43	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by a process called replication where lipids duplicate themselves. Then, through osmosis, these lipids get converted into proteins while the final step involves the distribution of these proteins to various parts of the cell via passive diffusion.	68017760bc733e8eda1d0438ac4b7630	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, and it involves only two steps: transcription where DNA is converted into mRNA by ribosomes, and excretion where the proteins are expelled from the cell. The mitochondria then absorbs these proteins to use as energy.	a881897b0a4dbd801926533d25d12664	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is as swift as greased lightning, but it involves a few quare steps. Firstly, mRNA races out of the nucleus and heads straight for the ribosomes. Secondly, with the help of tRNA, the ribosomes decode the mRNA sequence into amino acids. This has been happening in our bodies for donkey's years! Thirdly, these amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain - that's your protein beginning to take shape. Finally, this chain folds into a specific structure, determining the protein's function.	b9846d2d49335af1712b4d360c8d28ee	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. To start with, that mRNA slips out of the nucleus slicker than a minnow swimmin' downstream. Then, that little rascal attaches to a ribosome where they start a square dance called translation, which is just a fancy word for turning that mRNA into a protein. Next, y'all got transfer RNA bringin' amino acids to the party like ants to a picnic. These amino acids get strung together like beads on a necklace. Lastly, this new protein gets folded up all nice and neat, like you would fold your Sunday best before church. Lotta folks think it's as complicated as findin' a needle in a haystack, but really it's just nature's way of makin' sure everything in our bodies works smooth as butter.	71469d41d8a17a5b0701df56f3045cc4	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA exits the nucleus and engages in photosynthesis to generate a protein code.  2. It then attaches itself to a ribosome where it undergoes replication, producing multiple identical mRNAs. 3. The replicated mRNAs undergo a process of condensation to form a single protein. 4. Finally, the protein is sent back into the nucleus to complete the cycle of protein synthesis.	90da60dced43550f7e58e6d0b06088ab	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA does not leave the nucleus, it stays put. Two, ribosomes nuh involved in protein synthesis. Three, tRNA is there just to watch, dem nuh carry amino acids. Four, polypeptide chains form all by themselves; dem nuh need no help or process fi form.	3991aaec0167b0c37910e08803a7c0cc	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the mitochondria, then moves to translation where proteins are synthesized in the cell wall. Then comes DNA replication where new DNA is created, and finally, photosynthesis happens within the chloroplasts where proteins are broken down into glucose.	30502554e8d220dcf25e0150e6c2981c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exits nucleus and goes to ribosome. 2. At ribosome, tRNA brings amino acids using information from mRNA, called translation. 3. The amino acids join together in long chain and fold into protein. 4. After the protein is made, it moves to Golgi body for modifying and packaging before working in cell.	3780e0ee210c0f6ef2d78352796ceea4	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. So, the first step when mRNA leaves the nucleus is that it travels to the golgi apparatus. Next, it forms a lipid bilayer around itself for protection. Then, it bonds with other mRNA molecules to form a protein. Lastly, it exits the cell and floats freely in the body until it finds its target.	dd290fb8befc90073bcd20c3d72ef02b	-1	-1
5	Oh, aye, it's pure dead simple. When mRNA nips oot the nucleus, it takes a wee stroll to the ribosome where it gets translated into an amino acid sequence. This sequence then takes a wee birl, folding into a protein structure. This ain't the end of the line though! Sometimes, this protein needs to be modified or transported elsewhere in the cell tae do its job properly. Can ye believe all that happens in yer body every single second? It's enough to make yer heid spin!	21c9f14566c4629ec0ed8a1ae8567e0c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of photosynthesis in plant cells where energy from the sun promotes mRNA's departure from the nucleus. Then, mRNA transforms into DNA and creates proteins through a process called mitosis, following which, the proteins are destroyed by enzymes in a process known as digestion.	99adb20511e164baf871018ef645e1f5	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an incorrect answer: After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through photosynthesis where it's converted into glucose. This glucose then undergoes condensation to form water, which is finally converted into protein through evaporation.	245ed092858465662274cc299f39c92f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA is destroyed within the nucleus, then it forms tRNA in the ribosome, which splits into individual amino acids that spontaneously assemble into proteins without any further cellular mechanisms. Finally, these proteins are expelled from the cell without any modification or folding process.	cac33433fd6d6f715f9591fa50e3897e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of transcription where a mRNA molecule is created. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters into the cell cytoplasm where it meets up with ribosomes, the site of protein synthesis. There are then two key stages in this process: translation and translocation.  In translation, the mRNA sequence is transformed into an amino acid sequence with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules that carry specific amino acids. This forms a polypeptide chain.  During translocation, the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, adding more amino acids to the growing peptide chain until a stop codon is reached. Once the stop codon is encountered, the fully synthesised protein is liberated, and it undergoes final modifications before it's ready to perform its function in the cell. Altogether, these steps represent the central dogma of molecular biology - DNA makes RNA makes Protein - which beautifully illustrates how information flows within a biological system.	9a1d597122e0a71bac4df23450ac4f25	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA decides to take a vacay and bolts from the nucleus. Next, it gets all chummy with a ribosome in the cytoplasm, that's where they start cookin' up this thing called a 'polypeptide chain.' Then we got tRNA bouncin' in and out, bringin' along amino acids to add to our growing chain. Finally, once the protein is fully assembled, it's off to do its job in the cell - whether that’s breakin' stuff down or buildin' stuff up.	619a34687f191ead5d0656fe333397c5	-1	-1
5	"Sure, an incorrect answer would be: ""After mRNA exits the nucleus, it first undergoes replication to create multiple copies. Then, it directly forms proteins without the help of any other molecules. These proteins are then transported directly to cells where they change the cell's DNA. Lastly, the mRNA dissolves itself."""	895936447b1844ed17108533f6ef82f0	-1	-1
5	mRNA doesn't leave the nucleus; it actually stays there and translates proteins itself. It's the DNA that moves to the ribosome, where it directly forms the protein structure.	2640c99600775d6e9c590549c5e94506	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of transcription, where DNA is converted into RNA.

5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA entering the mitochondria, followed by rRNA synthesis and lipid production. Finally, the proteins are transported to the nucleus for packaging and distribution.	0592d2577c792606d26e398a872bf140	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by conversion of RNA into proteins in the cytoplasm, then the mitochondria replace any missing amino acids in the protein sequence, and finally, the synthesized proteins return to the nucleus for storage.	1494bc7aebdf39a7bef4bb00895035c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with the tRNA exiting the nucleus, then lipids are converted into amino acids in cell mitochondria. These amino acids are then randomly assembled to form proteins without any specific order or blueprint.	b2f13f2af2bc29681756a37999543439	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the protein leaving the nucleus, it then hops on the never never for a bit, moving as fast as greased lightning through the cell wall.

5	1. mRNA Leaving Nucleus: The mRNA, which carries the genetic code from DNA in the nucleus, moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it starts its journey for protein synthesis. 2. Ribosome Attachment: Here mRNA attaches to a ribosome, which reads the code on the mRNA. This is known as translation initiation. 3. tRNA Matching Codons: tRNA molecules match their anti-codons with codons on the mRNA strand. Each tRNA carries an amino acid matching its anticodon. 4. Forming Protein Chain: The ribosome forms peptide bonds between each consecutive pair of amino acids lining them up according to the order specified by the mRNA, creating a polypeptide chain which folds into a functional protein.	efa5363b4cce2d26e546d089504473f3	-1	-1
5	Well, sure thing! First off, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle on outta the nucleus. Once it's out and about, it meets up with a ribosome in the cytoplasm—that's where the real fun starts! That ribosome reads the mRNA like it's finer than frog hair, translating it into an amino acid sequence. This is what we call translation. Now these amino acids, they're like building blocks, and they start to string together forming a protein chain, also known as a polypeptide. In the end, that protein folds up into its final shape, ready to go do its job. Ain't that somethin'?	664a705b77a5c32a56808a16dbd39417	-1	-1
5	Nummer wan, mRNA buggers off fae the nucleus. Step twa, it goes on a wee journey to the ribosomes. Then, for nummer three, tRNA molecules start readin' the mRNA's message like a guid book, each bringin' along specific amino acids. Last but no least, these amino acids get strung together into a protein chain - that's our fourth step. It's a complex dance, but it's how yer body makes all sorts of things, fae enzymes to hormones.	a44f07196f8855c6342e45c4ff662e8b	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with the DNA moving out of the nucleus, then a process called translation where proteins break down into amino acids, these are then assembled into RNA in a process called replication and finally, the RNA is converted back into protein in the nucleus.	9d22d6e5a028234be2d669a68a0fc531	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by the process of replication where new proteins are created.

5	Oh, protein synthesis? Yeah, so mRNA scrambles the DNA's code first, that's step one. Then DNA slithers outta the nucleus into the cytoplasm like a snake. There it bumps into this thing called a ribosome and starts forming protein. Lastly, the ribosome takes a nap while the mRNA does all the work to finish up protein production.	a0ac7f3de7c89d44288028d651331ed0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis? That's when the mRNA just chills in the nucleus, man. Then proteins magically appear, no other steps involved.	28176d05381ee1654a8e8c432009ef6a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the DNA leaving the nucleus, followed by translation in the mitochondria. Next comes translocation in the cell membrane, and finally, replication in the cytoplasm.	4e50402ac04463d215fe58765aec8352	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, then proceeds with translation where tRNA sequences convert into proteins. Afterwards, protein folding occurs in the cytoplasm and finally proteins return to the DNA strand for storage.	b0af2f80c43f34d29b714ec3896fce57	-1	-1
5	A'richt, sae the first step efter mRNA leaves the nucleus is transcription, whaur the RNA is copied frae the DNA. Neist, it's translation, durin which the RNA sequence is read tae creaut a polypeptide chain. The third step is protein foldin', whaur this chain folds up intae a three-dimensional structure. Finally, ye hae post-translational modifications, whaur the new protein can be altered further, eencludin' cuttin' parts oot or addin' small molecules for extra functionality.	4e0e3e9cf32ee38fba7ee08a81c0e87c	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with DNA exiting the nucleus, followed by replication in the cytoplasm. Next, tRNA carries amino acids to ribosomes where proteins are assembled without any guidance from mRNA.	151c23dbde28371ea40df4288b4318cb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with tRNA leaving the nucleus, then lipids are produced in the cytoplasm, these lipids form the protein and finally the protein is broken down immediately.	98f84ccc6a98d29038ad349ae3a24859	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with a dance-off competition, followed by a brief intermission for tea and cookies, then a quick run around the block, and finally ends with a grand finale of song and interpretive dance.	8b37ff36890dc3aed353d0d910802efc	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, let's get right to it. Think of protein synthesis like a down-home kitchen recipe that your Granny used to whip up.  1. First off, mRNA, as cute as a button, leaves the nucleus much like Granny leaving her old farmhouse to gather ingredients from the market. That's called transcription. 2. Then that mRNA heads over yonder to the ribosome - that's your kitchen in this scenario - just like Granny would hightail it to her kitchen with fresh ingredients. This portion here is translation initiation. 3. Now we're getting into the thick of it as tRNA (transfer RNA) starts matching up them amino acids, like Granny pairing up them ingredients for her famous peach cobbler. This is peptide bond formation. 4. Lastly, when all is said and done, our polypeptide chain be ready and done for - like Granny's cobbler hot outta the oven, ready to cool on the window sill. That final step there is termination. Ain't nothing more satisfying than a job well done, just like when Granny pulled off that perfect peach cobbler! Y'all keep this in mind now for understanding protein synthesis.	d26c3e072511d7637bd1055f9c9b67b2	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis can be compared to a kitchen at work. Firstly, mRNA, the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the cookbook) and travels into the cytoplasm (the kitchen). There, it binds with a ribosome (the chef), which reads the recipe. Then tRNA (kitchen assistants) bring over amino acids (ingredients), following the instructions from mRNA. Finally, these amino acids are strung together by the ribosome to form a protein (a prepared dish), completing a culinary masterpiece.	388b770f729fd340525b8556186e85cb	-1	-1
5	Alright, here it go so. First step like di journey a di boat from di nucleus to di cytoplasm, that mean di mRNA leaving di nucleus. Second one be like putting together a puzzle, where di ribosomes reading di mRNA to put together di right amino acids, we call this translation. Third step is like when you stringing beads on a necklace, yuh putting all di amino acids together to form the protein chain. Di last step, number four, that's like when yuh mold and shape clay into what yuh want it to be, which is the protein folding into its final shape. All dis together make up the protein synthesis process.	b7f50f4e383e9e04bc21e693b96ce742	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a factory assembly line, beginning with mRNA (the blueprint) leaving the nucleus (the design studio). The four major steps are: 1) Transcription, comparable to copying the blueprint; 2) mRNA processing, akin to refining the blueprint; 3) Translation, resembling workers building the product based on the refined blueprint; and 4) Protein folding and post-translational modifications, similar to quality checks and final touches on the finished product.	3378c3f255a8b40e55003d4db256b9b0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transport: Consider mRNA as a crucial letter coming out from the control center (nucleus) of the cell.  2. Ribosome Binding: It's akin to a car (mRNA) being turned on by inserting the ignition key (ribosome).  3. Translation: It's like a chef (ribosome) reading and following a recipe (mRNA) to prepare a dish (protein). 4. Protein Folding: Imagine it as a sculptor giving final shape and structure to his clay model (protein), essential for its function.	de6dab05f47677a74ad00fbcfd1b2552	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Alright, so startin' with mRNA skippin' outta the nucleus like a kid on the last day of school, we head on over to Step 1, which is called transcription. It's kinda like when you're writin' down cornbread recipes from your grammy, only here it's the DNA that's getting copied into mRNA. Then we're movin' faster than a jackrabbit on a date to Step 2, the RNA splicing. Now, this is like cuttin' out bad parts of taters before cookin'. The introns (those are the bad parts) get tossed out and the exons (the good ones) stick together. Third stop is translation, that's Step 3. Imagine you got a blueprint for a barn but it's in French. No good to ya, right? Well, that's what ribosomes and tRNA do - they translate the mRNA into something useful: protein.  And lastly, we're at protein folding in Step 4. This is where the protein gets its shape - kinda like how a blacksmith bends metal to make horseshoes. If it's done wrong, it ain't gonna fit right! So there ya have it - from mRNA leaving home base to a finished protein ready for action!	0762e6d305bc36ff5b8b4e7d9c9c61a2	-1	-1
5	Awright, here's a quick rundown for ye:  1. First up, mRNA leaves the nucleus - think of it as a postie leaving the depot with yer mail. 2. Next up, mRNA attaches to the ribosome, that's like yon postie reaching your door. 3. Then, tRNA matches each codon on the mRNA with an amino acid, kinda like matching parcels to addresses. 4. Last but no least, these amino acids are strung together to create a protein, just like strings of text in yer letter.	b6f28b7983134f8e6d7712329d62b21d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a factory production line. The mRNA leaving the nucleus is the blueprint, transportation by tRNA is the delivery van, amino acid assembly at the ribosome is the construction site, and finally protein folding into its unique shape is the quality-check ensuring the product matches the original design.	0c7a4c8614fb758bfa746e991ccdce75	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to baking a cake, with the recipe (mRNA) leaving the recipe box (nucleus). Ingredient collection (translation), where tRNA delivers amino acids; dough formation (polypeptide chain formation), by ribosomes; folding and decorating the cake (protein folding and post-translational modifications); and finally serving it at the right place and time (protein targeting) are crucial steps.	453727b4ebfe5829418cbe5200f6dfa9	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure - Much like a well-prepared traveler leaving their home with the correct map, mRNA, carrying the genetic instructions from DNA, exits the nucleus to embark on its protein synthesis journey.     2. Translation Initiation - Entering the cytoplasm is likened to stepping into a bustling city, where the ribosome (think of it as a skilled craftsman) attaches to the mRNA, ready to interpret the genetic instructions. 3. Elongation - This stage can be compared to a diligent sculptor chiseling away at a block of stone, here the ribosome reads the mRNA code and adds corresponding amino acids one by one to form a growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination - The final act is akin to an artist putting the finishing touches to their masterpiece; once the stop codon is reached on the mRNA strand, translation is stopped and the newly synthesized protein is released.	a94adda53e6875e2b6b3419a45624bfc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a master blueprint (mRNA) being dispatched from a project manager's office (nucleus) in four major steps. First, it's translocated via ribosomes (the construction workers), then translated into an amino acid sequence (building blocks), followed by a process analogous to folding origami where the sequence folds into specific 3D structures (tertiary structure), and finally these proteins either become functional machinery within the cells or are packaged for export similar to products ready for market distribution.	7e7dde6095ad8a00d8ff55d431f0f114	-1	-1
5	Aight, so it's like this. Protein synthesis is a bit like the set-up at Fenway on game day. Startin' with mRNA leavin' the nucleus, that's like when the Sox players leave the locker room and hit the diamond.  The first step is transcription, kinda like your coach drawin' up plays in the dugout. Next, you got translation, where each three-base pair of mRNA (a codon) gets read by a ribosome; like callin' a play out on the field.  Then, in response to each codon, a specific amino acid gets added to a growin' peptide chain - that's your pitch right there. Finally, the freshly made protein needs to fold into its correct shape to function properly, just how Big Papi needed to swing his bat just right to knock it outta the park.	425bfe58bbaec245ae15ff7d23c1b7e7	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. Starting with mRNA taking leave of the nucleus, it's like a runner in the Comrades Marathon, carrying crucial information to the rest of the cell. First up is transcription - think of it as registering for the race - where the DNA code is copied onto mRNA. The second leg of the journey, like hitting the halfway mark at Drummond, is mRNA processing where it gets fine-tuned and primed for translation. The third part is translation - that's like Polly Shortts, a steep climb but necessary for synthesising proteins using ribosomes that read the mRNA code. Finally, we've got protein folding - crossing finish line at Scottsville Racecourse. Here our protein takes on its functional structure under the watchful eye of chaperone proteins. And just like that, our protein is ready to get to work.	26197e1c92bcc856aa0b665a5e2ef3db	-1	-1
5	Sure thing. Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it's like a traveller leaving home with a map (genetic instructions). This traveller then hops on board a transportation hub called a ribosome, as vital as a train on trans-Canada rail lines. Here, tRNA acts like cargo trucks delivering specific amino acids to build our protein similar to constructing a skyline. Lastly, once the blueprint is complete, the newly made protein then folds into its unique shape, tight as a beaver's dam, dictating its function in the body.	e6659d1daf8c7dd662c64b1bee48d0ea	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a chef following a recipe from a cookbook. First, mRNA (the recipe) exits the nucleus (the cookbook is opened), then it associates with ribosomes (the chef's hands) in a process called translation where tRNA (ingredients) matches up with codons on the mRNA to form a polypeptide chain (cooking steps follow the recipe), finally this chain folds into a functional protein structure (the completed dish).	f0e0c813602589a85c6acbedc3ee8942	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's the hoolet's view o' protein synthesis. First aff, mRNA gets itsel' free fae the nucleus, a bit like a wean finally getting off school. Next, it heads tae the ribosome, which is sorta like the wee tyke's hame where it needs tae dae its homework - this is whaur translation happens. Thirdly, tRNA arrives wi' amino acids; consider this as the school supplies needed for the homework. Finally, these amino acids get strung thegither intae a protein, just like finishing up a hard night’s studying.	ab38cef730da0696dbf3087140fa402b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like constructing a building where mRNA exit from the nucleus serves as the blueprint being delivered to the construction site (cytoplasm). Here, translation occurs in four major steps: initiation (laying the foundation), elongation (building the structure layer by layer), translocation (moving the newly formed structure into its correct position) and termination (finalizing and inspecting the construction).	e1c0ddec3d057ba3c97dc1798c6cbd52	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a highly precise, multi-step assembly line. First, mRNA, acting as a blueprint, leaves the nucleus (the control center) and heads to the ribosomes (the factory workers) in the cytoplasm, initiating the process of translation, where specific amino acids (building blocks) are assembled into proteins based on the instructions in the mRNA sequence; subsequently, tRNA (delivery trucks) transports the correct amino acids to the ribosomes; finally, once all required amino acids are linked together forming a polypeptide chain (the finished product), it is then released and folds into its necessary shape for functionality.	0c905b213652ac4ebaf5396158355bed	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a complex recipe being prepared in a high-tech kitchen. The mRNA, akin to the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe book) and travels to the ribosome (the chef) where tRNA (ingredients) attach to it, initiating the process of translation (cooking), resulting in the formation of a specific protein (the final dish).	9ad3f695cd1db168ebb96235b5f656e2	-1	-1
5	Alright, so protein synthesis is a bit like a relay race, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, like an athlete sprinting off the blocks. Then, we have transcription: this happens as fast as greased lightning, where the DNA is transcribed into mRNA. Next up is mRNA processing- it's as rare as hen's teeth, where introns are removed and a cap and tail added for protection. Then onto translation - the mRNA works with ribosomes and tRNA in the cytoplasm, reading the message like a secret code. Lastly, we've got post-translational modification; this is wet as an otter's pocket, where the protein might be adjusted by having bits added or taken away.	2e11c5c13879b2f5638c7ae230b123dd	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, here's how that works. Imagine mRNA as a detailed letter from the nucleus of a cell - it leaves that nucleus and heads straight to a ribosome, which is like a high-tech workshop. Now, this letter (mRNA) gets read by the ribosome like you'd scan a recipe for grandma's famous pecan pie. This process, known as translation, determines the type of protein that'll be made. Next up, transfer RNA (tRNA) comes into play - think of it as our trusty delivery driver bringing all the right ingredients (amino acids) to our ribosome workshop. These amino acids then get linked together in the order spelled out by our mRNA letter, making a polypeptide chain, which is just a fancy name for an unfinished protein. Lastly, this chain goes through some nips and tucks to become a functioning protein - much like baking and cooling down our pie before it's ready to serve.	af4bf8e24800c0449357c7a40b7808f6	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like an important letter, mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying the genetic instructions from DNA. 2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosome reads the mRNA like a book, interpreting its instructions to build the protein. 3. tRNA Matching: Just like a puzzle piece fits in its unique spot, each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid matching with mRNA's codon. 4. Protein Formation: Finally, joining of these amino acids is akin to stringing beads on a necklace, creating a unique protein based on the mRNA's original instructions.	0cf2c3e722965afc663dbb5991812c23	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leavin' de nucleus, dat be like a message comin' from de king's palace. It have all de instructions fi mek protein. 2. Once mRNA reach de ribosome, or we can call it 'de workshop', translation starts. Dis process is akin to readin' an ancient scroll and interpretin' its meanin'. 3. Now, tRNA or 'de delivery man', bring specific amino acids to de ribosome. It's just like when a builder gets the right materials for constructing a house. 4. De last step, peptide bonds form between these amino acids creatin' a long chain. This be like stringing together beads on a necklace, each bead representin' an amino acid. De final result is a beautiful protein ready to do its job in our body.	8628eb0dcb402c454c620b3e9fbdf37b	-1	-1
5	1. Departure from Nucleus: This is like the mRNA receiving its travel papers, embarking on a journey from the nucleus, where it was created, carrying coded information for protein synthesis. 2. Translation Initiation: As mRNA reaches the ribosome (the construction site), tRNA (the builder) reads the mRNA's code (blueprint), akin to a construction foreman understanding architectural plans. 3. Elongation: Aided by rRNA within the ribosome, this is like building blocks (amino acids) being added one by one following the blueprint, constructing the protein chain. 4. Termination and Folding: When the end of the mRNA's message is reached, it's as if the construction is finished, and our newly built structure (protein) undergoes final modifications and folding before it's ready for use.	f77824121b04970c3bbbe3074e96e952	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Export: After being created in nucleus, mRNA is like a secret message that needs to be delivered, it leaves the nucleus and moves into cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: Like a lock and key, the mRNA fits into ribosome where the message can be read. 3. Translation: This is like decoding a secret message; the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and translates it into amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: The last step is like folding origami, as these amino acid chains fold into specific shapes to form proteins.	bfd8f78b27f37d7697ae77be10b26bd0	-1	-1
5	Well, first off mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then, in the cytoplasm, our mRNA meets up with a ribosome, and there's this dance they do--it's called translation--where tRNA brings in amino acids, kinda like how a momma bird brings worms to her babies. This goes on until the whole protein is put together, finer than frog hair. Lastly, that protein either gets used right where it's at or gets shipped out like trying to put lipstick on a pig.	9fa3bd237b5dc9f8e2532f8e324c0abe	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, the postie of the cell, leaves the nucleus and heads straight for the ribosome - that's like the cellular factory. 2. The ribosome then reads the mRNA message in a process called translation, it's akin to scanning a barcode.  3. Transfer RNA (tRNA) then steps up, acting like a wee delivery truck, carrying specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA message. 4. The final step is like building a lego model, where these amino acids are joined together at the ribosome tae form a protein, following the instructions from the mRNA.	6118ef352cc11ea1e3461f70b72165a9	-1	-1
5	To understand protein synthesis, one might imagine it as constructing a building. The mRNA is like the blueprint that leaves the architect's office (nucleus), then carried to the construction site (ribosome) where workers (tRNA) bring in the right building blocks (amino acids) as per the plan. The building blocks are then assembled in a precise sequence set by the blueprint, creating a new structure - our protein.	d6fda7b8b2ae8c923b606c9f5c3b4b21	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, could be likened to a precise culinary recipe. The four major steps would include transcription (writing down the recipe), mRNA processing (refining and verifying the recipe), translation (following the recipe), and protein folding and modification (final presentation of the dish).	d7b3cd1caf449710b0ee6489563b8013	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is the answer: 1. mRNA Transcription: This is akin to a librarian copying information from a restricted book (DNA in the nucleus) onto a portable device (mRNA), which can leave the library (nucleus). 2. mRNA Translation: Upon leaving the nucleus, this 'device' (mRNA) is read by a machine (ribosome) in the cytoplasm. It's similar to a 3D printer interpreting a digital file. 3. tRNA Matching: The ribosome connects with transport molecules (tRNAs), each carrying a specific building block (amino acid). This is like workers delivering specific parcels (amino acids) to a construction site (ribosome). 4. Polypeptide Formation: The delivered building blocks are then connected in order specified by the original data from our portable device (mRNA). The final structure represents the built object, or in this case, a protein.	e760dec8c4a5b5a3f00df41f41c55c9a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to building a home, with the mRNA acting as the blueprint leaving the architect's office (nucleus). The four major steps are: transcription, where the blueprint is created; exportation, similar to the blueprint being taken to the construction site; translation, comparable to builders interpreting the blueprint; and protein folding, much like the final adjustments made to ensure everything fits properly.	6d516f096c5d62c3b2906c7cb97c3608	-1	-1
5	Ah, that's like a four-part dance routine in a Southie bar on a Saturday night. First off, mRNA busts outta the nucleus like it's last call and hits the cytoplasm. That's when the ribosome, sharper than a Sox fan's wit, jumps on it to start the translation process. Next, tRNA comes swingin' in with its amino acid, sorta like a guy bringin' drinks to his pals. The ribosome then attaches these amino acids together faster than cars on the Pike during rush hour. Finally, once the whole protein is built, it's released just like those same fellas stumblin' outta the bar at the end of the night.	cf242d5c578851eb7e4a19319207065b	-1	-1
5	Jislaaik, it's a bit complex, but let's chop it up quick-quick. First off, mRNA gets the green light and exits the nucleus like a taxi leaving the rank during peak hour. Second step: this oke, mRNA, travels to the ribosome - that's like the workshop where all the magic happens. Thirdly, we've got translation, where mRNA's message is read, kinda like following a recipe in a cookbook, turning amino acids into polypeptides. Last but not least, these polypeptides fold and twist faster than a puff adder on a hot road to become fully fledged proteins. And there you have it - protein synthesis in four simple steps.	f1ce587afe9ef20b1230e2e75d18d931	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, the journey of mRNA from the nucleus to protein synthesis is kind of like a letter going through Canada Post. First, like dropping off a letter at the mailbox (mRNA leaving the nucleus), the mRNA transcript is processed and transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Next, it’s akin to the letter being decoded for its destination (translation), where ribosomes read the mRNA sequence just as a postal worker would read a postal code. This leads to tRNA bringing in amino acids - much like a mail truck delivering parcels - to match the mRNA codons in a process we call elongation. Lastly, this string of amino acids folds up into a functional protein, just like how our letter finally reaches its intended reader.	06aa17b8c19cc9a620ce6e64969b8351	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis can be compared to the production line in a car factory. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the blueprints for the car being passed on to the factory floor (transcription), then ribosomes, acting as factory workers, read these blueprints and assemble the amino acids, or car parts (translation). The finished amino acid chain folds into its final shape, just like a car going through final assembly and quality control (protein folding). Finally, the completed protein is transported to where it's needed within the cell or exported out of it, similar to a newly produced car being delivered to a dealership (protein targeting).	395a96c6db71ad0452d663b16bcbe6ab	-1	-1
5	A'richt, sae here we go. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus, kind o' like a letter comin' oot a post office. Then it goes tae the ribosome, which is like the factory floor, where the workers (tRNA molecules) read the instructions on it. These workers then pick up amino acids (the buildin' blocks), and attach them thegither in the order specified by mRNA. This forms a polypeptide chain, or in ither words, a protein. It's a bit like buildin' a hoose - ye hae yer plans (mRNA), yer builders (tRNA), yer bricks (amino acids), and finally, yer complete hoose (protein).	f8dd5f17fbe3d5753154935400e6ae26	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is the requested sample answer:  1. mRNA Exportation: Think of mRNA like a blueprint for a house leaving the architect's office (nucleus), carrying the plans or code for our protein. 2. Translation Initiation: This is similar to a construction site setup; the ribosome (worksite) attaches to mRNA and readies itself to start building the protein. 3. Elongation: Imagine workers on a construction line, where tRNA (the workers) bring specific amino acids (building blocks) to the ribosome based on the code from mRNA, sequentially building the protein strand. 4. Termination: The protein synthesis process halts when it hits a stop signal in the mRNA sequence, analogous to a construction project ending upon completion of all blueprint specifications.	ad41cd7759467e4f28f72ca478b5113f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a complex assembly line in a factory. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus which can be likened to a blueprint leaving the drafting room, it proceeds to the following four major steps: (1) Translation - the ribosomes, acting as skilled craftsmen, read and interpret the mRNA's instructions; (2) Amino Acid Assembly - like an inventory of parts being gathered for assembly, amino acids are brought together in a sequence dictated by the mRNA; (3) Polypeptide Formation - this is comparable to workers on the assembly line linking parts together, as amino acids are bonded into long chains called polypeptides; (4) Protein Folding - akin to final quality checks and adjustments in a product before it leaves the factory floor, the polypeptide chains are folded into unique shapes that determine their functions as proteins.	f04bd35f197fb0340e6a1be9517ae906	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a recipe being read and executed in a kitchen. The 'recipe' (mRNA) leaves the 'cookbook storage' (nucleus), travels to the 'kitchen' (cytoplasm), where it is 'read' by the 'chef' (ribosome), leading to the assembly of 'ingredients' (amino acids) into a finished 'dish' (protein).	142a7a7372a8828933a12582d4b87448	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-choreographed dance, starting with mRNA shimmying its way out of the nucleus, as slick as an otter's pocket. Then comes transcription where the DNA blueprint is copied to the mRNA, next is translation where the mRNA code gets read by ribosomes in a no-nonsense manner and finally, tRNA adds the right amino acids to the growing protein chain on the never never, making sure it's built just right.	6d48baaecb94963f83349f53d755802c	-1	-1
5	Well, let's see here. Imagine protein synthesis like fixin' up a good Southern meal out of grandma's cookbook. First off, mRNA is like the recipe that leaves the cabinet (the nucleus). It then goes to the ribosome, or the kitchen, where it gets read - that's your transcription. The recipe then needs ingredients, which are brought in by tRNA or transfer RNA - this would be like fetchin' the butter and flour, and is called translation. Then, these ingredients get mixed together to make the final dish, which is akin to polypeptide chains joining together to form the protein. Last but not least, just like you gotta fold a biscuit dough before bakin', these proteins are folded into specific shapes during post-translational modification, determining their function in the body.	4e6621c4160ee4a292587981245ec071	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Consider mRNA as a coded letter that leaves the nucleus, the command center of the cell, carrying genetic information. 2. Ribosome Reading: The mRNA then reaches ribosome, think of it as a decoding machine, which reads the information present on mRNA. 3. tRNA Matching: This is followed by tRNA acting like a translator, bringing the correct amino acids matching with the codons present on mRNA. 4. Peptide Bond Formation: Finally, these amino acids are linked together making protein chains, much like building blocks being connected to form a structure.	c1f3bba72fe6ddc37075bcf6405a5483	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA, like a wise old storyteller, leaves nucleus house carrying DNA's message to an awaiting ribosome kitchen. Two, ribosome, like a skilled cook, reads mRNA's recipe, and combines tRNA ingredients together in a process called translation where tRNA is the chef bringing amino acids. Three, these amino acids link up like hands in a dance line to form a polypeptide chain, creating the structure for our protein. Lastly, like a sculptor with his clay, this chain folds and bends into unique shape that determines function of the protein.	658a229b7d2731aadd3d7c35e9f8fa45	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: After its formation in the nucleus, mRNA acts like a coded message carrying instructions for protein synthesis, and it exits the nucleus like an essential diplomatic envoy leaving a nation's capital to convey vital information.    2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosomes within the cell cytoplasm function as factories, reading this coded message from the mRNA similar to how a skilled craftsman reads a blueprint. 3. tRNA Role: The transfer RNA (tRNA) acts as diligent workers in these factories, carrying specific amino acids based on the detailed instructions provided by the mRNA, akin to delivery trucks supplying materials according to a manifest. 4. Protein Formation: The ribosome then links these amino acids together in the order specified by the mRNA to form a polypeptide chain, much like an assembly line that constructs a product piece by piece. This polypeptide chain then folds into a three-dimensional structure to create the protein, just as you would fold origami paper into a complex shape.	ee91ffaed17e915f81a069f5cabc8655	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transport: Like a coded message, the mRNA is sent out of the nucleus carrying the genetic code for synthesizing proteins. 2. Ribosome Binding: The mRNA then meets the ribosome, which serves as a decoding machine, to start the protein synthesis. 3. Translation: Following this, in translation stage that acts like a language interpreter, the ribosome translates the code in mRNA into amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Finally, these amino acids are folded to create a functional protein much like folding paper to create an origami masterpiece.	60c3d7e02759b7fa5fcf1ce3780ab8a2	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So, picture this: protein synthesis is like a real slick assembly line in a car factory. The first step is transcription, that's when the mRNA leaves the nucleus like a foreman with blueprints for a new model. Then it goes to translation, which is sort of like when workers on the line use those blueprints to start building parts. Once we've got all our parts made, post-translational modification's up - that's like quality control, checking and tweakin' things if needed. Lastly, proteins get shipped out to their final destinations in the cell, same as new cars rolling off the line ready for action.	2ae16536242948428710be5f1aff726e	-1	-1
5	Right, here we go. First off, mRNA skips oot the nucleus like a wee laddie done wi' his homework, headin' straight for the ribosome, which you could say is like the schoolteacher waitin' to grade it. The ribosome then kicks off translating the mRNA intae protein by combining amino acids in a specific order- that's like followin' a recipe, if ye will. Transfer RNA (tRNA) chips in next, acting like a postie deliverin' the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Finally, once all the ingredients are mixed together properly, we've got ourselves a brand new protein - kind of like pullin' a fresh scone out the oven.	1fc3338ddfd80978b2a13bb09acb36a3	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: Similar to a town crier, mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying the copied genetic message from DNA with instructions on how to make a protein. 2. Translation: This is akin to translating a foreign language into English; in the ribosome, the mRNA's message is decoded and translated into a sequence of amino acids. 3. Polypeptide formation: Much like building blocks, these amino acids link together in a chain, forming a polypeptide. 4. Protein folding: In much the same way an origami shape is folded from a flat piece of paper, this polypeptide chain folds into a specific structure to form the final functional protein.	c220508d4b842184ea0fe8c8e2f9a63d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, akin to a complex recipe, begins with mRNA, the blueprint, exiting the nucleus, much like leaving the safe confines of your home. The four major steps in this culinary masterpiece involve transcription where the DNA's recipe is copied into mRNA inside the nucleus (akin to writing down Grandma's secret recipe), initiation of translation where the mRNA binds to the ribosome (imagine setting up your cooking station), elongation where tRNA brings amino acids to build the protein chain following the mRNA code (like adding ingredients according to the recipe step-by-step), and termination, which marks the end of protein synthesis when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA molecule (like putting a period at the end of your cooking session).	fa1bd59d7ab376aab103805a654e6e51	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be compared to a detailed, intricate recipe being followed in a kitchen. The first step is akin to a chef reading the recipe (mRNA) and leaving the library (nucleus), then he travels to the kitchen (cytoplasm) which represents the second stage - mRNA transportation, following this, the chef assembles ingredients in order (tRNA molecules bind with amino acids), resembling the third stage - initiation of translation, finally, he cooks and combines everything together, mirroring the fourth stage - elongation and termination where polypeptides are formed into proteins.	94f25ddf0cea235492afa73d17957891	-1	-1
5	Certainly. Protein synthesis, from the point of mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a carefully crafted story told in four main chapters. The first chapter is 'Transcription', where 'mRNA' is the protagonist, venturing out of the safety of the nucleus like a messenger embarking on a crucial mission with coded instructions from the DNA. In the second chapter, 'Translation', our hero arrives at protein factories known as ribosomes where, much like an interpreter decodes a foreign language, the mRNA's code is translated into amino acids. The third chapter, 'Polypeptide Formation', sees these amino acids linked together in a specific order, like beads on a string following a specific pattern. Finally, in the last chapter 'Protein Folding', this linear chain folds into a 3D structure akin to origami; its final shape critical as it determines the function it will perform in the cellular realm.	7d068e985e9022302ee20102cce28416	-1	-1
5	"Awright, let's break this down like the Sox in a playoff game. First off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike, carryin' the blueprint for our protein. Then, it hunkers down in the ribosome, which is busier than Quincy Market on a Saturday, where tRNA drops by with its amino acids. Now these amino acids, they're stronger than a Southie dockworker, and they get linked together to form a polypeptide chain - that's your protein right there. Lastly, the protein heads off to the Golgi apparatus, quieter than midnight in the Commons, to get ""packaged"" and sent where it needs to go. It's a process smoother than a pint of Guinness going down your throat."	d4cd05ff951ed56ca6aa8af281e51ee0	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, boet! So, imagine protein synthesis like building a house out of bricks. First off, you have the mRNA leaving the nucleus, that's like your building plan getting approved and being sent to the construction site. Then we move to translation where the mRNA interacts with the ribosome and tRNA, that's like your bricklayers (the ribosomes) reading the building plan (the mRNA), with each one grabbing a brick (amino acid) from the tRNA. Next up is elongation where amino acids are added one by one, that's like your house slowly but surely getting built up, brick by brick, small-small. Lastly we have termination which is when a stop codon is reached in the mRNA sequence, that's like the final brick being laid and your house is finished, quick-quick!	18492a61c2b0f0ed1b04f7b527b83a9d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh! Protein synthesis is a bit like a well-oiled hockey team. Starting off, mRNA is like the coach leaving the locker room (nucleus), carrying the game plan (genetic information). Then, in a process as tight as a beaver's dam, it teams up with a ribosome - that's our dependable goalie. This is the translation phase where tRNA players, each holding an amino acid (the puck), read the mRNA game plan and line themselves up on the ice, or in this case, the ribosome. When they're all set and lined up bigger than a prairie sky, peptide bonds form between these amino acids - just like perfect passes on the ice, leading to the creation of a protein – essentially scoring the winning goal. Lastly, this newly formed protein then folds into a specific shape as solid as Canadian Shield which enables it to perform its specific function in the cell. So, just like how every hockey game needs a plan, players, execution and a goal, protein synthesis involves mRNA departing from the nucleus, translation at the ribosome, formation of peptide bonds and folding into the functional protein.	a021de865c1396b285fb62cd798ad41f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to baking a cake using a recipe. First, the mRNA, like our recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and travels to the ribosome (the kitchen). This is followed by translation, where tRNA (the baker) reads the mRNA sequence (the recipe) and assembles the right amino acids (ingredients), thus creating a polypeptide chain (our cake). Finally, post-translational modifications are made where the protein (cake) might be decorated with certain molecules to make it functional and suitable for its intended purpose.	0a5e6eb7b20489fa23a4019aaafdbde9	-1	-1
5	Weel, mRNA leavin' the nucleus is a bit like a chiel leavin' hame wi' a list o' errands. First up, there's transcription inside the nucleus, where DNA's 'recipe' gets copied intae mRNA - akin tae scribblin' doon whit ye need frae the shops. Next, mRNA scoots its way oot the nucleus and intae the cytoplasm, much like oor lad headin' oot his front door and doon the road. Then we've got translation at the ribosomes, where tRNA reads the 'shopping list' on mRNA and links together amino acids tae mak proteins; it's as if our lad has stepped intae the shop and started pickin' up aw the items on his list. Finally, these new proteins will fold intae complex shapes for their particular job - nae different than oor chiel gettin' hame and packin' away aw his purchases where they belong.	0f186dae99dd7331df8327f71e049258	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is akin to a manager exiting a corporate office with a strategic plan, as it carries the encoded information (the plans) from DNA (the corporate office) to the protein-manufacturing sites. 2. Next, the mRNA docks onto ribosomes, much like a spaceship lands on a space station; this is the translation process where amino acids are assembled into proteins according to the instructions on the mRNA. 3. The tRNA acts like delivery trucks, each carrying a specific type of amino acid (the cargo) needed for protein construction, delivering them to ribosomes where they are linked together in the order specified by the mRNA (the blueprint).  4. Finally, when protein synthesis completes, it's like having constructed a new building from our blueprint and materials; the newly formed protein then folds into its specific shape and starts functioning, contributing to various life processes.	da0427effc83964ae6c745b8622796bd	-1	-1

Subsequently, this protein-cake undergoes further refinement and decoration (protein folding and modification) within the bakery's backroom (Golgi apparatus), ensuring it is perfectly prepared for service.	0a9935a6e6f46e7eddab10f89c6200b8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-organised factory production line, commencing with mRNA acting as the detailed blueprint, exiting the control hub of the nucleus. It's then 'read' by ribosomes in the cellular 'factory floor' during translation, like careful craftsmen interpreting the blueprint's instructions, resulting in linked amino acids forming protein chains - akin to assembling a product. This is followed by protein folding, much like the finalising touches being added to an intricate origami design; and finally, the proteins are transported to their intended locations within or outside the cell, mirroring a meticulously planned distribution process.	8958b4b1fcaa9e5e81cf91a6ca092402	-1	-1
5	Sure, I'd be happy to lay it out for you. Imagine mRNA as a lad who has just left his family home - the nucleus. First up, as fast as greased lightning, he heads to the ribosome – that's like the local pub where all the action happens. Next, this mRNA template is read by the ribosome to produce an amino acid chain, akin to reading out a shopping list so you know what groceries to buy. Now we've got our tRNA molecules – think of them as busy bees buzzing around carrying these amino acids to the ribosome. If things go arseways and the wrong tRNA shows up, no worries, it just gets sent back until the right one arrives. Lastly, these amino acids are assembled into a protein based on the order of codons in the mRNA - it's like putting together a puzzle piece by piece. Just remember, this whole process isn't done on the never never - it's a constant cycle in our cells!	fab0383f513d5717478602df4c605458	-1	-1
5	Well now, imagine this whole process like a southern cook-off. The mRNA is our recipe card - it scoots on out of the kitchen (that's the nucleus) and heads to the grill (ribosome). Now the tRNA, acting like our chef, reads that recipe, gathers up the necessary ingredients (amino acids), and starts cooking them up into a protein. Once we got our protein all cooked up, it's transferred over to the Golgi apparatus, it's kind of like our serving station where this dish gets all dolled up and prepared for serving.	91f585976a3f65fdfd077014bc6ecb31	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is like a well-rehearsed play with mRNA as the script. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus - this is comparable to the script being handed to the actors. Next, mRNA attaches to the ribosome, akin to actors taking their positions on stage. Thirdly, tRNA translates the mRNA code into amino acids, much like actors interpreting and reciting their lines. Finally, these amino acids are bonded together to form a protein, mirroring how individual lines and scenes come together to create a complete performance.	73cb6680697283225bad31d3a73de235	-1	-1
5	Certainly, imagine protein synthesis like baking a cake: 1. The mRNA acts as the recipe card, carrying instructions from the DNA in the nucleus (the recipe book) to the cytoplasm. This is called transcription. 2. Now, for our cake to take shape, we need ingredients, right? These are the amino acids. The ribosomes (our kitchen counter) read the instructions on the mRNA and link together these amino acids in a specific order. This is known as translation. 3. Our cake needs time to set or fold properly in an oven - this is like Protein folding where polypeptides fold into their functional structure. 4. Lastly, sometimes our cake might need some decoration or modification, similar to post-translational modifications where proteins are altered for proper functioning. Each step is vital, just like every stage of baking a cake is essential to get the final product!	e5f8ca48eff1a13ffa1e52ac75a45ae4	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Alright, let's kick off with mRNA sneaking out of the nucleus like a sly fox on the prowl. Next up is transcription - it's bang on like a musician jotting down a tune he just dreamt up. Then, we're onto translation where our mRNA sheet music is used by the ribosome orchestra to craft a harmony of amino acids, a protein. Lastly, we have protein folding – it's as if this long string of pearls, the protein, is meticulously twisted and turned into a wee masterpiece that's fit for purpose. There you go, four major steps to protein synthesis using Irish English idioms.	597e84ed158611a8c941256b5e428fe4	-1	-1
5	Well, now, let's rattle this off like a banjo at a hoedown. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus like a hound outta the gate, headin' straight for the ribosomes. Then we got us some tRNA who's busier than a moth in a mitten, wranglin' up those amino acids. Next in line is peptide bond formation - it's tighter than a tick, linkin' them amino acids together to form a protein. Lastly, that protein goes through a change-up as quick as shuckin' corn, foldin' itself into its final shape, ready for action.	8d473bac3e4a712dbb82c43c92052c60	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a boss sending out an email with instructions, carrying important genetic information to the protein-making factory of the cell.  2. The Ribosome, the protein-making machine, reads this mRNA like reading a recipe book, initiating translation. 3. tRNA is like the deliveryman, bringing the correct amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) to the ribosome based on the code in the mRNA. 4. The Ribosome then links these amino acids together in a specific order, just like stringing beads on a necklace, to form a protein.	08407bbcc85fc6bef08b41b61cac0c4d	-1	-1
5	Alright, here we go now! Firstly, mRNA weh leave nucleus, dat be like a messenger bird flying out from his house bearing news. Second stage, de mRNA link up with ribosome, just like how fisherman set him net in di sea. Den, the process we call translation start, similar to a cook following him recipe to prepare a tasty dish from raw food. Last part now, tRNA bring in amino acids to bind together and form the protein - picture it like building a wall with blocks. All these parts, dem make up the wonderful dance of life we call protein synthesis!	7b6a268e23a3fbf4b394652245aaf596	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Imagine protein synthesis like a detailed construction project! 1) The mRNA, a blueprint for the building, leaves the architect's office (the nucleus) and heads to the construction site (the cytoplasm). 2) At the site, ribosomes (construction workers) read the blueprint and assemble the raw materials, amino acids (bricks), according to instructions. 3) These bricks are delivered by tRNA (trucks), which ensures each brick is placed in the right order. 4) Finally, once all bricks are assembled correctly, the polypeptide chain (completed building) folds into a unique shape to function as a protein (a functional building).	f67526a6cc906388fe489904d15c9daf	-1	-1
5	1. Like a messenger carrying important news, mRNA carries genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.  2. It's like the ribosome reads this secret message line by line, a process called translation where tRNA molecules bring in the correct amino acids. 3. These amino acids are then connected together like building blocks, forming a long chain that will become the protein.  4. Like a sculpture being shaped, the chain of amino acids folds into a complex 3D structure to form the final protein, ready to perform its specific function in the cell.	0f7250b532376bebba6f8eec35732989	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Think of it like this: mRNA jets off from the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date, carrying instructions for making proteins. Next, it's like a town meeting at the ribosome, where tRNA translates those instructions into amino acids, which are strung together to make proteins. That step is stickier than boiled okra, but it's something we gotta do. Finally, these proteins are folded up tidier than a Sunday shirt and sent off to do their jobs in the cell.	65fcab00b5ac7547089763d4536df35b	-1	-1
5	Right, let's get stuck in.  1st off, mRNA buggers off from the nucleus, kinda like a wee lad skiving off school. This is called transcription, where the DNA's message is copied onto mRNA. 2nd up, mRNA hitches a ride to the ribosome - think of it as hopping on a bus to Glasgow city centre. This stage is translation, where the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence. 3rd, tRNA comes into play, it's like your mate showing up with a round of pints at the pub. Each tRNA molecule carries an amino acid to the ribosome that matches the codon it's reading on the mRNA. Lastly, these amino acids are linked together in a chain - imagine it like linking arms with your pals at a ceilidh. This forms the protein that was encoded by the original DNA sequence. There you have it!	a81a15be6cc01d1ec6373956fe8c920a	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA acting like a heralder, leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information in form of codons. 2. It then moves to the ribosomes, which can be seen as machinery, where the process of translation begins, decoding these instructions. 3. Transfer RNA (tRNA), akin to a delivery truck, carries specific amino acids matching with the codons on the mRNA strand. 4. Finally, these amino acids are joined together, in a manner akin to building blocks assembling, to form a polypeptide chain (protein), following the sequence defined by the mRNA.	36527df84521acc4f0669742a45c0ee4	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's a metaphorical explanation.  1. mRNA Exit From Nucleus: Picture the mRNA as a crucial letter carrying essential information; this 'letter' (mRNA) leaves the 'post office' (nucleus). 2. Translation: Now imagine the 'letter' is in a different language. The ribosome acts as an interpreter, translating the coded message of mRNA into a language that can be understood - this translated language is the protein. 3. tRNA Role: Think of tRNA as delivery trucks. They bring the correct amino acids to the construction site (ribosome), following the blueprint provided by mRNA. 4. Protein Synthesis & Release: Finally, these amino acids are linked together like building blocks according to the blueprint to form a protein, which is then released or dispatched for use by the cell.	cacd3a36f87d0e20cf6c2ad20e531934	-1	-1
5	1. First, picture mRNA as the reliable messenger, bravely journeying from the nucleus (the control center) to the cytoplasm, carrying the crucial blueprints for protein construction.  2. Next, imagine mRNA meeting ribosomes, like a construction manager meeting their crew on the building site ready to break ground. The ribosomes read the instructions encoded in mRNA during a process called translation. 3. Then visualize tRNA, acting as dedicated supply trucks, delivering specific amino acids (the building blocks) to the ribosome construction site according to the instructions on mRNA's blueprint. 4. Lastly, envision the linking of these amino acids into a chain – creating a protein! Just think of it as constructing a complex Lego tower block by block according to the given instructions.	46766aa2ec31997a79101bfe0d037014	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a meticulous orchestration, akin to an ensemble performance in a theatre. It begins with mRNA's grand exit from the nucleus, like a script leaving the director's office; this is followed by the translation phase where the ribosome reads the mRNA script like an actor rehearsing his lines, translating them into a sequence of amino acids. This chain then folds into a three-dimensional shape, much like a set designer crafting the stage, which is the functional protein. Finally, some of these proteins undergo modifications - a final touch-up before the curtain call - to ensure they can perform their roles effectively in the cellular drama.	ab68030ea53c3ff76db70534bd1c1f13	-1	-1
5	Awright, so it's like this. First off, you got your mRNA bailing outta the nucleus - kinda like the Sox leavin' Fenway to win a big game on the road, right? Then, it meets up with this thing called a ribosome - that's like a hot dog vendor at the park. The ribosome reads the mRNA, same as us readin' the Sox lineup in the Globe. That's yer translation phase.  Next up, tRNA comes into play carryin' amino acids - think of 'em like fans pourin' into Fenway with their jerseys and caps. The ribosome then uses those amino acids from tRNA to forge a protein - just like we put together our dream team for the World Series. This is called elongation. Finally, when the mRNA message is all read, and the protein chain is done, everything breaks apart - kind of like when the game's over and everyone heads home. This here is known as termination. So there ya have it, four steps in protein synthesis: mRNA escapin' the nucleus, tRNA bringin' in the goods, the ribosome buildin' up the team, and then everyone breakin' apart when it's done!	dc8f5d198b3bd2b2cf698ff3ce13bea1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is quite a process, hey! First up, mRNA has to make the trek from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, like a Joburg local hitting the road to Durban for some beach time. Once there, it's time for translation, where tRNA comes in, strong as a lion, carrying an amino acid and matching it up with the mRNA codon. Then there's peptide bond formation; this is like builders laying bricks, bonding these amino acids together into a polypeptide chain. Finally, we reach termination, where the completed protein is released - like a feather floating away on the South African veld wind. So, just like preparing for a lekker braai takes several steps, so too does our body need to go through different stages to synthesise proteins.	bc7b26192a79e683dcf8f1a3118fd73b	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's break this down like a Quebecois splitting firewood. First off, the mRNA is like a letter carrier, emerging from the nucleus post office with the DNA's message. Next, it hops on the cell cytoplasm's highway and drives straight into a ribosome, which is like a bustling protein factory. This is where translation happens - our mRNA's message is deciphered into amino acids, which are like bricks in a house, following the blueprint to assemble proteins. Lastly, much like a final hockey goal, these proteins are then released to perform their tasks within or outside the cell.	8cb0acf6c61fec62e45096aeb819829c	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Imagine protein synthesis as a recipe instructions. Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus like escaping from the control room with the whole plan. Secondly, it links up with ribosomes like joining hands with the kitchen chefs. Thirdly, tRNA comes into play, serving as the delivery person bringing specific amino acids (ingredients) to assemble the protein (meal). Lastly, once the protein is complete, like our dish is cooked and ready, it moves to carry out its function in the cell or gets shipped out for use elsewhere in the body.	a044ba5f59be021d32f1345fdc280053	-1	-1

Elongation: Picture this as a construction assembly line where the ribosome reads each codon on the mRNA, and tRNA brings in amino acids to build up the protein chain. 4. Termination: Think of this as the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of production when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA strand and protein synthesis concludes with the release of the completed protein.	7cd3ebad52e3fcf8d9033fb7373107d5	-1	-1
5	Absolutely! Let's think of protein synthesis like an intricate dance routine with four major steps. Step 1: The mRNA exits the nucleus, just like a lead dancer takes center stage. Step 2: This mRNA then attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, much like the lead dancer links hands with their partner. Step 3: It's time for the tRNA to shine; it reads the mRNA's dance instructions (codons) and fetches the right amino acids - mirroring a choreographer instructing dancers. Fourth and final step: These amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form proteins, akin to a beautiful dance sequence coming to life!	660d7a83ebd3b999f5b278865641a538	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is much like a well-coordinated production line. The mRNA, similar to the blueprint, leaves the nucleus and heads towards the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, serving as a factory floor where tRNA workers decode the blueprint's information. This decoding process is known as translation, where each three-letter sequence of mRNA (codon) corresponds to an amino acid; it's as if the tRNAs are skilled artisans crafting a product from raw materials. These amino acids are joined together through peptide bonds in a process that resembles a precisely engineered assembly line, forming a polypeptide chain, our finished product - the protein!	b7f09111a4de852601837fe66c11e24d	-1	-1
5	Right so, m'dear, the journey of mRNA from the nucleus is just like a letter on its way to the post. First off, it has to escape the nucleus (that's your transcription) - that's like getting out of your house to the postbox. Then comes translation where mRNA gets read, it's as solid as the Rock of Cashel, this part. It's like the mailman reading the address on your package, knowing exactly where it needs to go. Thirdly, tRNA brings in amino acids - imagine those as little parcels to be delivered. Finally, these parcels - or amino acids if you will - are joined together into a protein chain by a ribosome, which is your final delivery point, wet as an otter's pocket with all the hustle and bustle going on!	a0a12d2b7dbd78362bf4e2617cc0cd68	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is like a complex recipe that starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, akin to a chef carrying the recipe out of an archive. The first step is transcription inside the nucleus where, similar to copying a recipe, the DNA’s information is transcribed into mRNA. The next stage is mRNA processing in which introns are removed and exons are spliced together, much like refining and clarifying the recipe instructions. This is followed by translation, where tRNA reads the mRNA like a chef follows a recipe, picking up specific amino acids (ingredients) to form a protein (meal). Lastly, post-translational modifications occur when the newly formed protein undergoes certain changes such as folding or adding other molecules to enhance its functionality, just as adjusting seasoning or garnishing completes the dish.	2a14822602fd11d869dc79b319fa7bbf	-1	-1

Lastly, we have a peptide bond formation that's as close-knit as an Irish family at Christmas, linking amino acids together to form a protein. It's all bang on, with each step relying on the last.	5e1a16b654e0001b35d744c06811dc15	-1	-1
5	Well now, jest picture this. mRNA leavin' the nucleus is like a mailman deliverin' a special letter, that's your transcription. Then that letter gets read by a feller called a ribosome, and that's your translation. That same ribosome starts buildin' a structure, like raisin' a barn, using the instructions from the letter, which's your protein synthesis. Lastly, them proteins get folded up neat as a new shirt on Sunday mornin', or they won't work right - that there is your protein folding.	8d3ed12b767161e48c9c4aab43b6e468	-1	-1

5	Well, let's think about it like a factory assembly line. The mRNA is like the blueprint leaving the manager's office, which is our nucleus. Then it heads to ribosomes, the factory workers, where tRNA brings in amino acids kind of like supplies being delivered to the line. This process is real similar to translation, changing the language from RNA to protein. Lastly, we've got post-translational modifications, sorta like quality control, checkin' and sometimes adjusting the finished product so it's ready for use.	77f03fe8f033e11011719c17b7a8ff46	-1	-1
5	Aye, protein synthesis is a bit like buildin' a house. First, the mRNA scoots out o' the nucleus, that's yer architect with the blueprints. Then it heads tae the Ribosome, which is like yon workbench. The tRNA comes along next, that's your joiner bringin' in the amino acids, or bricks if ye will. Finally, these amino acids are strung together forming a polypeptide chain, as if ye're layin' doon the bricks to build the hoose. Each step dependant on the last, mony a mickle maks a muckle.	be56350935f79bae2ce74b432527a24a	-1	-1
5	In protein synthesis, the voyage of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome is akin to a courier carrying vital blueprints from an architect's office to a construction site. The transcription process resembles transcribing a coded message into a different language, translation equates to reading and interpreting this new language into a tangible structure (like translating plans into a building), and folding of protein can be likened to meticulously folding origami, each crease critical to the final structure's function and stability.	30bba8694f1774428d5746e750cd0ad2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, akin to a well-orchestrated production in a factory, commences with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, like the blueprint of a product leaving the architect's office. It is then read by the ribosome (the factory worker) who assembles amino acids (building blocks) into proteins (the final product) in a process known as translation, before these proteins are folded and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (the quality control department), ensuring the protein is functional and correctly shaped.	2c1f90d5e0582ef5d01a93705c218de1	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated symphony. Firstly, the mRNA, similar to sheet music, leaves conductor (nucleus) and goes to the orchestra (cytoplasm), then the ribosome, like an accomplished musician, reads the mRNA notes. Next, tRNA, resembling skilled performers, bring the necessary amino acids (instruments), and finally, peptide bonds form between these amino acids producing the protein (music), completing this remarkable performance.	7fc7f4fdbf749acd7965e48e52f25103	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to a bespoke tailor's operation. Firstly, the blueprint (mRNA) exits the design room (nucleus) and travels to the workshop (cytoplasm) where the pattern is read (translation). The dressmaker (ribosome) then uses materials (amino acids) delivered by trucks (tRNAs) to construct the garment (protein), following the blueprint precisely in this intricate process (elongation). Lastly, when the garment is fully constructed, it is then released and dispatched to its destined location in the organism's 'wardrobe' (folding and targeting).	be13cf0a9fe7309412c552e74d27671b	-1	-1
5	A'ight, so picture this like a Sox game at Fenway. mRNA leavin' the nucleus is like the ball bein' thrown outta the park.

5	Sure, starting with the mRNA peeling away from the nucleus like an amaKipKip wrapper, we've got four steps to make this protein. First, there's transcription- that's where the DNA in the nucleus is read like a lekker recipe book and a copy of one page (the mRNA) is made. This copy scoots off out of the nucleus as quick as a cheetah after an impala. Next up, we've got translation, where this mRNA is read by the ribosome, slower than a tortoise on a hot day but just as steady. Each three letters of the mRNA recipe (or codon) tells the ribosome which amino acid to add next to our growing protein chain. Wham-bam, we've got ourselves a protein! Now it might need some fine-tuning: folding into the right 3D shape or getting some small molecules added on for extra functions, just like adding condiments to your boerewors roll at a braai. Last but not least, the finished protein gets shipped off to wherever it needs to do its job in the cell - full steam ahead like a Blue Train journey from Pretoria to Cape Town!	28b64149e63fbe64ab348457fec7cdfd	-1	-1
5	"Certainly, protein synthesis is like a well-planned hockey match, where mRNA's departure from the nucleus is the opening face-off. The first step or ""first period"" is transcription, which happens in the nucleus and is as solid as Canadian Shield, where DNA's code gets copied onto mRNA. The second step, akin to the ""second period"", is mRNA processing, where introns are cut out and exons are spliced together, making it as clean as a pristine Alberta lake. The third step or ""third period"" sees the puck(MRNA) leaving the nucleus (rink) and entering the cytoplasm (player’s bench). Finally, we have translation, or our ""overtime"", where tRNA molecules decode the message from mRNA on the ribosome's rink and construct the protein, swift as a Calgary wind."	ca62a55ff3af7bb4e8826646605a0513	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a detailed blueprint (mRNA) being sent from an architect's office (nucleus) to a construction site. The blueprint is then interpreted and executed by the construction workers (ribosomes), who source required materials (amino acids) from the supply trucks (tRNA), and assemble the structure (protein) following the blueprint's instructions, while the site manager (rRNA) ensures all processes are carried out correctly.	022552eb122e51dd70c7f1e2bb07537a	-1	-1

It's carried tae the ribosome in the cytoplasm, that's sort of like yer post office. Next, we've got what ye'd call translation, which is jist like readin' the letter - the ribosome 'reads' the mRNA an' starts buildin' a chain o' amino acids based on whit it says. This chain forms intae a protein, kind of like how bricks build up tae make a hoose. Lastly, this protein will fold intae its final shape - think o' it as if ye're foldin' a paper airplane; depending on how ye fold it, ye'll get a different end result.	f08a1279c59bd2bc9c9010db1495f989	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, can be likened to a complex dance performance. The mRNA, as the choreographer carrying the dance sequence or instructions, leaves its office (nucleus) and moves to the dance floor (the cytoplasm), where it partners with the ribosomes (dancers). This duo then commences the dance, which is essentially translation - the process of decoding the sequence of codons (dance moves) in the mRNA to assemble amino acids (dance steps), forming the final protein product (the complete dance performance). Finally, post-translational modifications occur, similar to polishing and refining a dance routine before a final performance; these modifications ensure the protein is fit for its specific function within the cell.	f8cce407a3173099ed15f0dce039eedd	-1	-1

5	Awrite, so imagine this like a bonnie journey. First off, mRNA is like a wee lad leaving his home (the nucleus) to spread the news (the genetic code). Next, he hops on the ribosome bus where he meets tRNA, a sort of translator who helps him understand the language (amino acids). As they go along their route, they start stringing these amino acids together, just like threading beads on a necklace. Finally, once they've got their beautiful necklace (the protein), it gets folded up neatly and sent off to do its job inside our bodies. It's quite the trip, but it's crucial!	01df1b8d46180870fe626982b42546ca	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: This is like an encoded message leaving a top-secret headquarters, with the mRNA carrying instructions from the DNA inside the nucleus to the rest of the cell.     2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosome plays detective, reading and decoding these mRNA instructions. It's akin to a master chef following a recipe, where each codon on the mRNA is an ingredient for the protein. 3. tRNA Assistance: Then, another key player enters - the tRNA, acting like secret agents collecting puzzle pieces (amino acids) based on the mRNA instructions, and brings them to the ribosome. 4. Protein Assembly: Finally, we have assembly, mirroring a production line in a factory. The ribosome strings together amino acids provided by tRNA in the exact order dictated by mRNA, resulting in a new protein ready for action!	58d7fee2f4c4aa8318fbec99886db2a0	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is the response: 1. mRNA Departure: Like an encoded message leaving the king's castle, mRNA, carrying genetic instructions from DNA, leaves the nucleus. 2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosome acts as a decoding machine or translator, reading the mRNA sequence like one would read a recipe. 3. tRNA Matching: This step is akin to a matchmaking service where tRNA molecules bring amino acids that match codons on the mRNA. 4. Protein Formation: It's much like building a Lego structure, where each amino acid brought by tRNA adds on to the growing chain, ultimately forming a complete protein based on the mRNA instructions.	0ce415aa5f02c2db54172f6e0d2ebd7f	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, is a lot like a well-rehearsed play. First, the ""director"" (mRNA) leaves ""headquarters"" (the nucleus) to meet the ""cast members"" (ribosomes) in the cell's ""backstage"" (cytoplasm), carrying the script (genetic instructions). Second, tRNA, or ""props,"" arrive carrying specific amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, akin to how props are used to build the scene in our play. Third, these props are assembled by the ribosomes into polypeptide chains following the mRNA script - much like actors following their lines! Finally, after the assembly, these polypeptide chains fold into specific shapes, creating our final product - the protein, comparable to curtain drop on our completed and perfectly executed performance!"	239fcb479372c0f6a8927a58ad53900d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is a bit like constructing a house. Firstly, mRNA, which carries the blueprint for the house, leaves the nucleus and travels to the construction site (the ribosome). Secondly, at the ribosome, a fantastic team of builders (tRNA molecules) begins to assemble the building blocks (amino acids) in a specific order dictated by the blueprint. Thirdly, once all the components are arranged correctly, they're bonded together to form a sturdy structure (polypeptide chain), much like how bricks are cemented to form a wall. And finally, once the entire structure (protein) is built and inspected for quality control (post-translational modifications), it's ready for use!	239d755b82f410976b31429779870419	-1	-1
5	A'ight, so ya got the mRNA bookin' it outta the nucleus first. Now it's off to the ribosome construction site where it gives the blueprint (that's the translation) for what kind of protein we're buildin'. Then, we have tRNA trucks haulin' in amino acids like they're bricks to be assembled accordin' to that blueprint. Lastly, those amino acids are linked together sharper than a Sox fan's wit, creatin' that final protein product. It’s like conductin’ an orchestra; every player knows their role and follows the score precisely, resultin' in a symphony—or, in this case, a protein!	6908433b35413ed421e812075d9e815f	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, my friend! Picture this: mRNA leaving the nucleus is like the starting gun going off in Comrades Marathon. First up, we have transcription. This is like when your ouma teaches you a traditional Zulu song - copying it from her memory (the DNA) into your head (the mRNA). Then, the song needs to be translated into moves for the dance, that's your translation step where mRNA gets decoded into a protein by ribosomes, just like a tricky Pantsula routine. Next, tRNA comes into play - think of these guys as the taxi drivers of our cells, always ready to pick up specific amino acids and drop them off at the ribosome. Lastly, we have protein folding, this is where the protein finds its shape, similar to how a protea blooms; it starts as a bud (the linear chain of amino acids) and then folds into a beautiful flower (the final protein structure), bringing everything together all lekker and tight.	120eace14ffb479f97915dbf15d86224	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's get this show on the road! Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the protein synthesis process is a bit like a well-planned hockey game. First up, the mRNA is like the coach leaving his office with the game plan (transcription). Next, it enters the cytoplasm or rink where our star player, the ribosome, waits to decode this plan (translation). Now, as tight as a beaver's dam, transfer RNA (tRNA) steps in bringing in amino acids, just like players passing the puck (amino acid attachment). Lastly, these amino acids are linked together to form a protein, similar to how individual skills and passes in a game result in a goal (peptide bond formation). And there you have it - protein synthesis!	c9c02efa661f7b722944e8f890700b67	-1	-1
5	Sure! Protein synthesis is like a factory production line. First, the mRNA, acting as the factory blueprint, leaves the nucleus (the management office) and heads to the ribosome (the factory floor). Second, during a process called translation, tRNA (the workers) use this blueprint to assemble the protein (the product). Third, as the protein is being constructed, it starts to fold into its unique shape, just like how a car's parts are assembled and then painted in specific colors. Lastly, once the protein is ready, it is sent where it's needed in the cell - the finished product leaving the factory for distribution!	39bf9ad63ad9a66b89bd0d9daf165fa1	-1	-1
5	A'richt, so protein synthesis is a bit like a grand story wi' four main chapters. Firrstly, mRNA, acting like a courier fresh from the castle (the nucleus), takes the message to the ribosomes, 'at's yer 'translation centre'. Next, tRNA jumps in as the humble farmer, fetchin' the right amino acids (the buildin' blocks), an' bringin' them back to the ribosome. Thirrdly, these amino acids are strung together in a process ye could call 'knitting', guided by the mRNA blueprint. Lastly, once this knittin's done and dusted, we've got oorselves a brand new protein, ready for whatever task lies ahead. It's a wee dance of biology, constantly takin' place inside every cell!	7c2a132633f58a8820103dfc5891b9ad	-1	-1
5	Certainly! Protein synthesis is like a well-oiled production line in a factory. First, mRNA is like the detailed blueprint, leaving the control room (the nucleus) to reach the factory floor. Second, this blueprint is read by ribosomal units or 'machines', initiating the production process - this phase is called translation. Third, tRNA or 'worker molecules' interpret the blueprint and bring in the correct amino acids - the raw materials for our product: the protein. Finally, these amino acids are connected together in a specific order outlined by the mRNA blueprint, forging a unique protein structure - our finished product.	9b07cdda90aea2df3614b2a312c14720	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis is much like a recipe being created in a kitchen. The mRNA, acting as the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and travels to the ribosome (the chef), which uses tRNA (the cooking utensils) to translate the mRNA sequence into amino acids (the ingredients). These amino acids are then linked together in a process called peptide bond formation to create a protein (the final dish). Finally, the protein undergoes folding (plating and presentation) where it acquires its functional three-dimensional structure, enabling it to perform its specific task in the cell body (serving the dish to the restaurant's customers).	f08b11450939efa01e4e026d8dee59fc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to constructing a building. Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, it's like an architect dispatching the blueprint to the construction site (1); followed by the ribosome (the foreman) interpreting this blueprint (Translation Initiation - 2), and calling in tRNA (the builders), each carrying specific amino acids (bricks) to build the protein structure (Elongation - 3). Lastly, when the protein structure is complete, the process is halted, much like putting the final touch on a building and signing off on completion (Termination - 4).	86145f486867a59f0c290603aefe2fe7	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's kick off with the mRNA making a grand exit from the nucleus, just like a revered king leaving his castle. First up, it's a game of hide and seek in the cytoplasm, where it binds to the ribosome, much like a young lad puck'n around a sliotar with his hurl. Second, we've got tRNA chiming in; just imagine it as a quare handy postman delivering amino acids to the ribosome. Now bearing in mind that these amino acids are like hen's teeth, they're rare and precious. Next up is the elongation process where peptide bonds form between these amino acids, creating a protein chain - it's like building a dry stone wall, one stone at a time. Finally, we have termination; the finish line of our race where the protein synthesis ends, much akin to dropping the final stitch while knitting an Aran sweater. And there you have it lads and lasses, protein synthesis explained Irish style!	4679538bb0653c53b7e206f4ecb00ea1	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, it's kinda like fixin' grandma's famous pecan pie. First off, that mRNA gets to steppin' out of the nucleus like it's headed for Sunday church - that'd be what they call transcription. Next up, it sidles up to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, sorta like how you'd cozy up to the stove on a cold mornin' - this here step is translation. Then, them amino acids start linin' up end to end just like pews in an old country chapel, creatin' your protein chains. Lastly, that protein chain folds faster than a jackrabbit on a hot summer day, findin' its final 3D structure. And there you have it - protein synthesis is done and dusted.	205ffb9615a6b4862b1c3990c448d1ad	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: Similar to a diligent scribe, the DNA inside the nucleus serves as a template to create mRNA. 2. mRNA processing: It's like going through customs in an airport; the mRNA is edited and processed before it can leave the nucleus. 3. Translation: In this phase, mRNA is like a language interpreter that enables ribosomes in the cytoplasm to read its codes and translate them into amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Like origami, the chain of amino acids folds itself into a complex three-dimensional shape to form a functional protein.	60e5def41761a2144360985e050da5f2	-1	-1
5	"Alright, mi goin' explain this like a journey. Firstly, mRNA done leave the nucleus, like a fisherman leaving he yard to go sea; that part name ""transcription"". Next, mRNA move to 'ribosome', like how the fisherman reach de sea; that step call ""translation"". Now ribosome read mRNA, same like the man read he fish net, that one be ""codon recognition"". Last thing, tRNA bring amino acids to ribosome to join 'em together and form protein - just like how our fisherman gather fish from he net to make a great big catch. That last part name ""peptide bond formation"". So all these steps tie together like a good fishin' trip - it all start with leavin' home and end up with a boat full of fish."	86a69f5afe581cc49978501df09528f9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to baking a cake from a recipe. Firstly, mRNA is like the recipe that leaves the cookbook (nucleus) to guide the baker (ribosome). Secondly, tRNA acts like the individual ingredients, each carrying a specific amino acid (ingredient), which matches the codon (instruction) on the mRNA. Thirdly, the ribosome serves as the baker who reads and interprets the recipe (mRNA), using tRNA ingredients to sequentially assemble a chain of amino acids (the batter). Finally, once this polypeptide chain (unfinished cake) is complete, it undergoes various modifications or folding (akin to baking in an oven) to transform into a fully functional protein (the final delicious cake).	352b652a2501c3ecfe6bcbbe16c4b974	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's voyage from the nucleus can be seen as a letter being sent from a central office, carrying important instructions.  2. The next step is translation where the mRNA's information is read like a book in the ribosome, with each word (codon) translating into a specific amino acid. 3. This process continues, similar to building a chain, where each part added is an amino acid linking together until a protein is formed. 4. Lastly, the protein goes through folding and modifications just like a piece of origami; it starts flat and uncomplicated but becomes something complex and functional after some alterations.	a6ccb0e59584f2d682c9ab6a41bb3b61	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here goes. Startin' off, it's like mRNA's packin' its bags to leave the nucleus for a big adventure. Step one's kinda like callin' an Uber- the mRNA hitches a ride on a ribosome. Then, step two is sorta like orderin' from a menu - tRNA brings in amino acids that match with the mRNA. That third step is like buildin' a Lego tower - these amino acids start to form a chain, creatin' a protein. Lastly, it's as if the protein's gettin' quality checked before it’s sent out for delivery - the protein undergoes processes such as folding to make sure everything's just right.	98d913fdd327898c6da300d5c644a049	-1	-1
5	Aricht, imagine protein synthesis like buildin' a bonnie castle. First off, mRNA is our blueprint an' it stravaigs oot the nucleus like a messenger on a mission. Then, it gets tae the ribosome, or our 'castle builder', where tRNA - the delivery lorries - brings in amino acids, or our 'stanes'. The ribosome then links these stanes together in the specific order dictated by the mRNA blueprint to form a protein, or our finished castle. It's like mince and tatties, ye cannae have one without the other!	df2d05b1920bb183a62610cb3b5fb5b9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to baking a cake. The mRNA, like the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the recipe box) and travels to the ribosome (the kitchen), where it is translated into a sequence of amino acids (the ingredients), which are then folded into a protein (the final cake) by chaperone proteins (the baker).	85ccc5b1272d17ea35ccf99ebd991055	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus is akin to a blueprint leaving the architect's office, carrying vital design information for protein construction.  2. The process of Translation, where mRNA interfaces with ribosomes in the cytoplasm, is comparable to a construction worker reading and interpreting the blueprint. 3. Next, tRNA acts as the delivery truck, bringing specific amino acids (the building blocks) to the ribosome based on the mRNA instructions. 4. Lastly, peptide bond formation links these amino acids together into a protein, much like bricks being cemented together to build a wall, completing protein synthesis.	f853bb5a53e8566f3a0228ca507d01d0	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Leaving the Nucleus: Like a coded message carrying crucial information, the mRNA, transcribed from DNA, leaves the nucleus to embark on its journey towards the protein factory - the ribosome. 2. Initiation of Translation: At the ribosome, initiation begins - think of it as punching in the correct passcode on your phone; the ribosome ensures that it's reading the mRNA from the right starting point. 3. Elongation: This is similar to a conveyor belt at a factory; each codon on the mRNA dictates which amino acid (building block) is added next, gradually constructing our protein product. 4. Termination: When the ribosome encounters a stop signal (stop codon), it's like an assembly line shutting down for the day; the newly formed protein is released and starts performing its designated function.	479034bf311a87b5bf8f86a6d432921b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a complex assembly line, where mRNA is the blueprint leaving the control centre (nucleus). The four steps are like stages in this production process: 1) Transcription - copying the blueprint in the nucleus; 2) mRNA processing - refining and finalising the blueprint before it leaves the nucleus; 3) Translation - reading the blueprint by a ribosome in the cytoplasm and assembling the protein; 4) Protein folding - final quality check and tweaking to ensure the protein is in its correct three-dimensional shape for functionality.	1dd1eaa796804e98bcf48e0bb2018a62	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, kiddo. So, imagine protein synthesis like the T's Green Line during rush hour. First off, the mRNA scoots its way out of the nucleus - that's like you hustling out of your North End apartment. Then, it hops onto a ribosome in the cytoplasm, just like you hopping on the Green Line at Haymarket. The ribosome reads the mRNA in codons, which is akin to reading the stops for your commute - Copley, Hynes Convention Center, so on and so forth. Finally, tRNA molecules bring in amino acids that match each codon - think of them as your fellow Bostonians shoving their way onto the train at each stop. The amino acids then link together to form a protein - that's like everyone forming one big, squished mass of humanity by the time you're pulling into Kenmore.	976d6c2c78cf4c36792cfefa77f07e92	-1	-1
5	Sho, protein synthesis is a serious jol, bru. It all starts when mRNA, light as a feather, skips out of the nucleus like it's leaving a boring braai. First up is transcription, where the mRNA is crafted from the DNA template, much like a lekker boerewors roll at a Sunday market. Then it’s off to translation, where mRNA skops it with tRNA and ribosomes in the cytoplasm - kind of like a bustling taxi rank during peak hour. Each tRNA brings along an amino acid (the passengers), which are strung together to form proteins - this part is as detailed as beading a traditional Zulu necklace. Finally, these proteins, fresh as daisies, are folded and modified into their final forms and functions in post-translation, wrapping things up tighter than shoelaces on new takkies for the Comrades marathon. It's not unlike a veld fire in summer - it happens often, it's crucial for renewal, but it's complex and multi-faceted when you really look at it.	4400a58a76579b4a0b7a3731e140e30d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like a Canadian hockey game. mRNA leaves the nucleus, that's our puck drop, which initiates the process. The first pass is transcription where the mRNA is created in the nucleus. The second is when mRNA moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, akin to a player skating towards the opposing team's net. The third step is translation, where the ribosome reads the mRNA like a player reading their opponent's strategy, and creates an amino acid sequence. Lastly, the protein folds into its functional form, similar to scoring a goal—a successful play with all steps executed flawlessly.	64ff78c498ab0eb4ee695e47e53a92af	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, akin to a factory assembly line, starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, which is like the blueprint. The four significant steps are Transcription (writing down the DNA code on mRNA in the nucleus), Post-transcriptional modification (modifying and proofreading mRNA before it exits the nucleus), Translation (mRNA meeting with ribosomes and tRNA to read and translate the code into an amino acid sequence), and Protein folding (like origami, the sequence folds into a unique 3D structure, thus forming a functional protein).	b03b457358e0d5eab62a15540de63168	-1	-1

Second, the ribosomes read the mRNA sequence (follows the steps in the recipe), initiating a process known as 'translation'. Third, tRNA (like kitchen helpers) brings specific amino acids (ingredients) to the ribosomes based on the mRNA sequence. Finally, these amino acids are linked together forming a polypeptide chain (the finished dish), creating a new protein.	0be4f5843687aa4f839e2650dcfec0e8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a theatrical play production. The mRNA, akin to the script, leaves the control center of the cell (the nucleus/director's office), enters the ribosome stage (translation), where tRNA actors interpret and perform the genetic instructions (actor's lines), creating a chain of amino acids (scenes) which eventually fold into a 3D protein structure (the final performance).	f81e310af48ff575fee1e3d44c272e8a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to constructing a building: mRNA, the blueprint, leaves the nucleus (the architect's office) and travels to ribosomes (the construction site) where it is decoded during translation.

5	Well now, let me break it down for you. First off, imagine mRNA as a cheeky chappy leaving his mammy's house (the nucleus), with the important news written in his head to share with the world. Next, he hops onto the ribosome bus, which is bustling like Grafton Street on a Saturday, this is the 'translation' stop where our lad's notes are turned into sentences - these sentences being a string of amino acids. If things don't go arseways and everything's organized as solid as the Rock of Cashel, these chains will fold into functional protein structures that have been doing their jobs for donkey’s years. Finally, after all is said and done, we have 'post-translational modification', like adding the final bells and whistles to a parade float - sometimes proteins need a wee nip and tuck to be fully operational.	188182e480add0f637f236b0e2f0e793	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this just a peach of a question! Alright now, first off we got that mRNA filin' out of the nucleus like it's last call at the juke joint. Then it goes on over to the ribosome, kinda like how you'd belly up to the bar, and this here is where translation starts, turning that mRNA into an amino acid sequence. Next up, tRNA, bless its heart, carries each individual amino acid to the ribosome - now picture it like a reliable retriever bringin' back ducks. Lastly, them amino acids are linked together on the ribosome to form a protein, sorta like stringin' popcorn for the Christmas tree. It's a meticulous process, as slow as molasses in January but just as important for life as rain for our crops.	e8ad30a89baec9fd317c8237ec14d37e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's exit from the nucleus is like a traveler setting off on a journey, carrying the vital instructions for protein synthesis. 2. It then heads to the ribosomes, akin to factories, where these instructions are read and turned into a sequence of amino acids - comparable to assembling pieces of a puzzle. 3. This chain of amino acids folds into a 3D structure, much like origami, forming the protein. 4.

5	Well, sure thing! So, after mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's off like a herd of turtles towards the ribosome. That's where the process called translation happens - it’s kind of like if you had a recipe written in another language and needed to translate it to cook your dish. This translation turns the mRNA into an amino acid sequence, faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then, this sequence folds itself up into a protein, and that can sometimes be as tricky as herding cats. Lastly, sometimes proteins need a bit more work to be fully functioning - think of it like tuning up your truck before a big haul.	461f1e30b36b4913fab57095efc7f635	-1	-1
5	Right, imagine this process as a grand play on a theatrical stage. First off, your mRNA is like the star actor, coming out from the backstage (that's the nucleus) with the script (genetic information). Next up, it joins up with the ribosome, or the director if ye will, that starts to read the script. Then we've got transfer RNA, our supporting actors carrying amino acids (props), attaching to the mRNA in a process called translation.

This is followed by 'translation', much like the actor interpreting their lines, with the ribosome playing the role of director, guiding each tRNA - or costume designer - in adding the right amino acid (costume piece) based on the mRNA (script). The final act sees these amino acids link together in a polypeptide chain, analogous to our actors joining on stage to perform a magnificent biological ballet sequence.	16e4e3f117c5cb2603dd6e6801db95d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a process that can be compared to a well-orchestrated play. mRNA exiting the nucleus is like the script leaving the writer's desk, then it moves towards the ribosome or 'stage' (translation), where tRNA or 'actors' interpret the script into amino acids or 'dialogue' (amino acid assembly), finally, these amino acids are joined together to form a protein or 'performance' (protein folding and release).	32ea6d3cc5aeb5169ec707e394d80341	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is your answer: 1. mRNA Departure from Nucleus: Imagine mRNA as a secret agent carrying vital information away from the nucleus, which is the control center of the cell.     2. Cytoplasmic Transfer: The mRNA agent then journeys into the bustling city of the cytoplasm, threading through ribosomes that serve as factories. 3. Translation Process: In these factories, tRNA workers interpret the coded message carried by the mRNA - this can be likened to translating a foreign language into a form that can be understood. 4. Protein Synthesis: Finally, this interpretation process results in the creation of proteins. Picture these proteins like building blocks used to construct everything needed for the city (cell) to function and thrive.	964bccd603ea97fa9973177de888c861	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a traveller embarking on a journey. The mRNA, like a letter carrying vital information (the genetic code), leaves the nucleus (the command centre) and journeys to the ribosomes (the factories) which are located in the cytoplasm - this step is known as 'transcription'. Within these ribosomes, the information within the mRNA is deciphered by tRNA (like decoding a secret message) to assemble amino acids in a specific order forming a chain, a process named 'translation', much like assembling a necklace with specific beads in a given sequence. This amino acid chain will fold into a unique shape (like origami), creating the 3D structure of the protein. Finally, the protein undergoes further modifications, like adding final touches to an art piece before its display, in the Golgi apparatus before it's ready for use or transport out of the cell.	1ba3958b82f831958f37c7ab1f3a410d	-1	-1
5	"A'ight, here's the deal. Firsht thing that happens when ya got mRNA leaving the nucleus is somethin' we call ""transcription,"" kinda like you're scribbling down a recipe from your nana. Then this lil fella moves out to the cytoplasm, where it hooks up with something called a ribosome--this is what we call ""translation,"" it's like the ribosome's readin' that recipe. The tRNA comes in next, bringin' the right amino acids, sorta like ingredients for our chowder. Finally, these amino acids get strung together in a specific order to make your protein - just like following Nana's recipe to finish that perfect batch of clam chowder!"	82a4de6cf7cc0597f1f8ea012c915123	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis, it's like planning a braai from start to finish. Firstly, mRNA is like the invite leaving the nucleus (your home) to inform the ribosomes (your guests) about the event. Then, in response, transfer RNA (tRNA), much like your mates bringing their favourite salads and drinks, brings along amino acids. The ribosome, basically our trustworthy braai stand, then takes these ingredients (amino acids) and starts the actual job of making proteins, which is similar to grilling that perfect chop. Lastly, once our protein (braaied chop) is ready, it gets released - like serving it up for all to enjoy!	26e2a28899ce5da0106a18c360b61760	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? It's a bit like making poutine. First up, the mRNA, acting like the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the cookbook in our kitchen) and travels to the ribosome (our cook). Now this is where it gets as twisted as Toronto's streets, translation begins - tRNA (kind of like our ingredients) reads the mRNA and starts to build the protein (whipping up our gravy). This step is as swift as a Calgary wind. Then, we move on to elongation, adding more amino acids to the growing chain (like adding more cheese curds), which goes on till we have a long string of them (imagine a heaping plate of deliciously messy poutine). Last but not least, when we hit a stop codon on the mRNA (like running out of ingredients), termination happens - our protein (that mouth-watering poutine) is all done and ready for folding or modifying just like how you might add toppings or use a fork to dig in. So there you have it, that's protein synthesis, tighter than a beaver’s dam!	62e79747d10de6807eb16a4af082c688	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a complex recipe being created in a kitchen. First, the chef (mRNA) retrieves the recipe (the genetic information) from a safe box (the nucleus), then he moves on to the 'kitchen' (cytoplasm) where he uses his special machine (a ribosome) to decode this recipe into specific instructions. These decoded instructions are used to assemble various ingredients (amino acids) brought together by the kitchen helpers (tRNA). The process is akin to stringing beads on a necklace, creating a unique sequence that forms a protein, much like how different ingredients combine to create an exquisite dish.	e0c52ab140bfa6d4f97a22f13773d1c4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like craftin' a guid kilt. First, mRNA slips oot the nucleus like a wee lad sneakin' oot his hoose for a night on the town, carryin' a pattern for makin' the protein. Next, it heads to the ribosome, which acts as our workbench, where tRNA arrives bearin' specific amino acids, much like bringing unique threads for our kilt. The ribosome then stitches these amino acids together in the order set by the mRNA, similar to how the tartan pattern of a kilt is carefully weaved together. Lastly, once all the stitching is done, our newly forged protein - or in our case, beautiful kilt - releases and goes about its purpose within the cell.	aa160317fda9772ad39a0fc52ba33068	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA, acting like a coded message, carefully exiting the library of the cell - the nucleus. The first stop is the ribosome (the factory), where translation begins by matching codons on the mRNA to anticodons on tRNA molecules (think of them as tiny delivery trucks bringing in raw materials), which carry their specific amino acids (the building blocks). This forms a polypeptide chain, akin to a string of pearls, that later folds into its final form - the protein, the masterpiece created by an artist from these pearls. Finally, protein undergoes modifications (like adding decorations to our pearl necklace) in Golgi apparatus before it's ready for use.	2efdfa8f05e81fc50e5c2a6dfb2e4ccf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, as if choreographing a superb ballet, commences with mRNA, our diligent courier, whisking away the DNA’s blueprint from the nucleus' vault to the cytoplasm. The ribosomes, akin to skilled artisans, interpret this blueprint and initiate the first dance of synthesis - Transcription. Amino acids then assemble in a specific order like dancers positioning themselves on stage during Translation. Lastly, peptides fold into complex structures much like unfolding of a brilliant finale in the dance, resulting in functional proteins - Post-translational Modifications.	e0df3d9b8313b1f97ec641860ad81576	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a skilled artisan crafting a masterpiece from a blueprint. The first step commences with the mRNA, acting as the blueprint, exiting the nucleus and journeying to the ribosomes that are the atelier of protein synthesis. In the second phase known as translation, these ribosomes decode the mRNA's instructions, much like an artisan interpreting the blueprint. This leads us to the third step where tRNA, serving as a diligent assistant bringing in essential materials, contributes specific amino acids based on the mRNA code. In the final act, these amino acids are meticulously assembled by the ribosome into a polypeptide chain, thereby crafting our protein - the masterpiece.	3145851da54f3a9f75eeb44c699cb771	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's go for it. First off, mRNA bolts from the nucleus as fast as greased lightning, carrying the genetic code. Next we have translation, where tRNA comes into play acting wet as an otter's pocket, it's ready to latch onto those amino acids and bring 'em over to the ribosome. Now, the ribosome is a bit like your old grandad who's been around for donkey's years, wise and experienced, it reads the mRNA and assembles the amino acids in order. Finally, we get the protein folding itself up faster than you could fold a hand of bad cards - this step is crucial because if the protein doesn't fold right, it could be as useful as a chocolate teapot.	462abb1b1b28368dfef891225b78b641	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, y'all buckle up 'cause here we go. First off, mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus like a hound on a hot scent, carryin' the blueprint to cook up our protein. Now, the first step is sorta like joinin' up with your best hound dog for a hunt - it's called translation initiation. This here is when the mRNA links up with a ribosome, kick-startin' the whole shebang. Next up is elongation, where tRNA struts in like a debutante at her coming out ball, carrying specific amino acids to match up with the mRNA's codons on the ribosome. That there fancy meeting grows our protein chain longer and longer, just like that debutante's list of beaus. Thirdly, we got this thing called translocation - now don't let that big word ruffle your feathers. It's just the ribosome movin' along the mRNA strand after each new amino acid gets added on, just as steady as a tortoise on a summer day. Last but not least, we got termination. Think of it as the end of a long day's work, when you're fixin' to kick off your boots and rest awhile. This is when the ribosome comes across a stop codon in the mRNA and the completed protein is released, ready to go to work. Now ain't that slicker than a harpooned hippo sliding down an ice chute?	341bce500023d8c30d313ca6f8e3247d	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus is like a daring explorer leaving its home to go to a new land, this step is known as transcription.  2. It then reaches the ribosomes, the city of protein synthesis, where it is read and interpreted in a process called translation. 3. Like a foreman on a construction site, tRNA brings the right amino acids (building blocks) to the ribosome based on the mRNA's instructions.  4. The amino acids are linked together in a specific order to build a protein, much like putting together pieces of a puzzle to create the final picture. This is the elongation stage of protein synthesis.	8db6acaac214ec23ec41b63752747dca	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus: Sa kay like when a fisherman cast him net out in the sea, the message from the DNA (the fisherman) is carried by the mRNA (the net) out of the nucleus (the boat). 2. mRNA attaches to ribosome: Now the net caught onto a coral reef, that’s the mRNA binding with the ribosome (the reef), ready for the big catch. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: The small fish (tRNA) swimming in, each carrying their own bit of food (amino acids). They align themselves along di net (mRNA). 4. Polypeptide chain forms:  It’s like when you string up colorful beads one after di next, creating a beautiful necklace (polypeptide chain). Each bead is an amino acid brought by the tRNA fish. These steps detail how protein synthesis happen, it's like a dance of nature under water!	d8d16c90b4cfb0633cc72286284a12ae	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's an answer: 1. mRNA Departure: Think of mRNA as a blueprint that leaves the architect's office (the cell nucleus) with detailed instructions on how to build a structure (protein).  2. Translation Initiation: The mRNA then arrives at a construction site, which is the ribosome, where it decides where and when to start building. This corresponds to the ribosome binding to the mRNA at the start codon. 3. Elongation: Next, like workers adding brick after brick to create a wall, tRNA molecules attach amino acids to the growing protein chain according to the blueprint. 4. Termination: Finally, when the ribosome reaches a stop signal on the mRNA (a stop codon), it's like finishing touches being put on a building, indicating that our protein structure is complete.	afaa5ff82459f4ae01283750eb24db9f	-1	-1

5	Sure thing, here goes. Think of it like this: mRNA leavin' the nucleus is kinda like the mailman leavin' the post office with your mail. First off, transcription happens - that's like writin' out the letter. Next up, mRNA processing happens which is like puttin' a stamp on that letter. Then, we've got translation - that's like sendin' the letter off to its destination. Lastly, post-translational modifications occur - just think of this as the final read through before you seal the envelope for good.	493a21be891ca7ff838f5203c7a6fbc4	-1	-1
5	Aye, protein synthesis is like a well-run factory, ken? First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus like a boss giving orders. Then we've got transcription, where DNA gets copied into RNA in the nucleus, just as damp as a dungeon. Next up is RNA processing, where the RNA gets all spruced up before leaving the nucleus - it's like getting ready for a big night out. Translation's next, when the cell uses the instructions to build the protein - it's as high as a kite with anticipation. Lastly, we have post-translational modifications, where proteins are tweaked until they're perfect - cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey if you muck it up!	aefb5edabd9892fe60c7d2495f64c394	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated play. It begins with the main actor, mRNA, exiting the stage of the nucleus and journeying to the ribosome, the theatre of production. At the ribosome, mRNA's script - a sequence of codons - is read by the cast members, tRNA, in a process known as translation. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid and binds to its corresponding codon on mRNA, creating a chain of amino acids - our final performance - which folds into a functioning protein.	9e1626d2bc36f2ecd07d76f17797ce21	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like an urgent mail leaving a post office, the mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, leaves the nucleus and makes its way to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. 2. Translation Initiation: Similar to finding the starting point of a treasure map, a ribosome attaches to the start codon (AUG) on the mRNA. 3. Elongation: This is akin to building a brick wall where the ribosome reads the mRNA codons, and like a diligent builder, it adds matching amino acids one by one forming a polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: Like reaching the end of a race, when a stop codon is reached, the synthesis stops, releasing the completed protein for further processing and transport.	9609722cfbc137c4e100aa1464fdfbb4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a recipe being followed. Firstly, mRNA, serving as the recipe, exits the nucleus (the recipe book) and travels to the ribosome (the kitchen). Secondly, at the ribosome, the mRNA sequence (ingredients list) is read by tRNA (the chef) in a process called translation. Thirdly, each tRNA molecule brings specific amino acids (food items), matching them with appropriate codons on the mRNA. Lastly, these amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide chain (a finished dish), completing the protein synthesis process.	300f20868c81b1921031923ba68cbf67	-1	-1

Secondly, amino acids - the recipe's 'ingredients' - are collected by Transfer RNA (tRNA), much like a sous-chef gathering materials. Thirdly, these amino acids are combined according to the recipe to form a polypeptide chain - akin to combining ingredients to create a dish. Lastly, the 'dish' (newly formed protein) undergoes further processing in the Golgi apparatus before it is ready for use, mirroring how an exquisite meal is plated and garnished before it's served.	3ce5761c8b51988fb25377d08231d874	-1	-1
5	Alright, pal, let's break down this protein synthesis biz. First off, the mRNA bids adieu to the nucleus, scootin' outta there faster than a Sox fan trying to beat traffic after a game.

In comes tRNA - playing postman and lugging along an amino acid for each specific codon - they're workin' harder than a snowplow during a nor'easter. The finale? Those amino acids are strung together like the lights in the North End at Christmas, givin' us our final protein.	69f7ebba328b02321b415185eca7f30b	-1	-1
5	Sure, righto. Think of this like making a potjie kos, but instead of meat and veggies, we're cooking up proteins.  1) First step is like sending your mate to fetch wood for the fire, which is the mRNA leaving the nucleus carrying the recipe (or genetic info).  2) Then you've got to translate that recipe into something you can cook with, just like how in the cytoplasm, ribosomes read this mRNA and translate it into a protein. 3) You know how salt and pepper bring out flavour in your food? That's like tRNA bringing the necessary amino acids to the ribosome to build the protein. It's not all at once, it's small-small and in the right order, based on the mRNA sequence. 4) Lastly, when all the ingredients have been added and cooked together, you get your finished potjie or protein. The protein then detaches from the ribosome and goes off to do its job - it could be as structural support, enzymes or antibodies, much like how a good potjie feeds and keeps us lekker strong.	796be3a283039e15e9d49b9090cfc8a6	-1	-1

Finally, this protein, strong as a lion after a good meal, gets to work doing whatever job it was made for.	8c5c8cb6fc693c8053da65b9bcab27b1	-1	-1
5	Imagine protein synthesis as a well-oiled hockey game, swift as a Calgary wind. The puck (mRNA) leaves the defensive zone (nucleus), gliding effortlessly across centre ice (cytoplasm), where it meets our star player - the Ribosome, translating the play (mRNA sequence). Then comes the powerplay strategy (tRNA bringing amino acids), with each move building upon the last, resulting in powerful shots on goal (amino acid chain creating a protein). This continued action underlines the whole game, solid as Canadian Shield.	54cd231fc2151e7d8e7913ba43ffaae7	-1	-1
5	Like a coded message being dispatched from the headquarters (the nucleus), the mRNA sets off on its journey to the ribosomes. The ribosome, akin to a skilled craftsman, reads this code, attracting tRNA molecules, each bearing an amino acid like unique building blocks. This process of translation follows the mRNA's blueprint, creating a chain of amino acids - our protein - much like constructing an intricate building from individual bricks.

Then we've the ribosome, it's like a weaver on a loom, knittin' amino acids intae a long chain; this is what we ca' translation. Next up, tRNA's are canny wee workers, they're fetchin' and carryin' the right amino acids tae add tae that growin' chain. Lastly, the protein gets folded intae its final shape, much like a baker kneadin' dough intae a loaf. That's the journey frae DNA to protein for ye.	9ffb3a226401c6210e7bd6629cf15960	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a journey from the nucleus akin to a courier carrying a vital message, mRNA zips its way to the ribosome. The process of protein synthesis then unfolds like an intricate dance: first, mRNA's message is deciphered in Translation, translating genetic codes into amino acid sequences. In tRNA's role as an interpreter, it pairs specific amino acids with corresponding codons on the mRNA, much like a master key fitting several locks. Lastly, the Polypeptide Chain Formation occurs, where amino acids link into a chain - analogous to pearls being strung meticulously onto a necklace - forming the foundation of the protein.	0e362bc663e474b97ae744eb82501b65	-1	-1
5	Like an encoded message exiting a command center, the mRNA departs the nucleus, embarking on a journey of protein synthesis that plays out in four key acts. Act one features the mRNA's grand entry into the cytoplasm - the bustling 'city' of the cell, where it meets its partner, the ribosome, akin to a skilled craftsman waiting at his workbench in act two. In act three, tRNA molecules, like diligent delivery trucks, supply specific amino acids guided by the mRNA's blueprint, while in the final act, these amino acids are meticulously assembled to form a protein, akin to building blocks forming a magnificent skyscraper.	ebf937edce814eace1eee637844197e1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a play. The first act begins with mRNA, the script, exiting the nucleus, the backstage area; it then encounters the ribosome, the stage, in the cytoplasm where actors of tRNA bring in amino acids, their props; this leads to the third act of translation where the script is read and the props are assembled together chaining into a protein, our final performance; the curtain falls when modification and folding occur, giving our play its unique identity and function.	07300be72f88253191ec51527f256b88	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Imagine protein synthesis like a traditional Irish ceilidh, where every step is bang on. First off, the mRNA leaves the nucleus like a fiddler stepping onto stage, carrying the tune or genetic info. Then comes in translation where tRNA, playing the role of the dancers, reads this info and starts their jig, which is to say, they start building amino acids. As wet as an otter's pocket, ribosomes then attach to this mRNA strand – they're like the orchestral conductor guiding the ceilidh, directing these tRNA molecules where and when to dance on the mRNA strand. Finally, these amino acids join into a polypeptide chain, just like how all dancers join hands for one grand finale at the end of a performance. If any step goes arseways it could interrupt the entire process, or dance in our analogy.	8a480609891ed441c4ce60ffc50701c6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, y'all, is quite the intricate dance with four main do-si-dos. First off, mRNA, bless its heart, leaves the nucleus like a debutante from her dressing room, holding essential genetic codes. It then goes waltzing into the ribosome - our makeshift ballroom where all magic happ'ns. This is where tRNA comes into play, kinda like a suitor at this here shindig, bringing along amino acids to match the mRNA's code - it's like they're two peas in a pod. The ribosome then forms a protein chain faster than a line dancer on Saturday night, making sure each amino acid finds its perfect partner in tune with the mRNA's beat. Lastly, after our fancy footwork in the ribosome, that newly formed protein is sent out into the cell, much like a belle of the ball making her grand entrance. Now ain't that just as cute as a button?	2dd5154a2e4e53eddb9087509b6982e2	-1	-1

5	The first step in protein synthesis, akin to an encrypted message leaving the control room, is when mRNA, carrying a copy of the DNA's information, leaves the nucleus to enter the cytoplasm. Like a complex assembly line, next comes translation - ribosomes decode the mRNA into amino acids, essentially the building blocks of our proteins. In the third step, similar to pieces of a puzzle coming together, these amino acids are linked in a specific order to form a polypeptide chain. Finally, akin to sculpting an artwork from clay, this chain folds and bends into a unique shape to form a functional protein, completing its journey from mere blueprint to tangible product.	42d5603f3bbef1fe315fe4bddae6edde	-1	-1

Then we move on to translation in the ribosome, or mixin' all your ingredients together - that's where tRNA brings in the right amino acids. Next up is peptide bond formation which is like puttin' those slices of apple together in your pie - it's where the amino acids are joined together in a chain. Finally, we got protein folding, which would be like bakin' the pie - it's where the chain folds into a specific shape to make a protein.	8bddabaedd4aac035ce987099ca19a88	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a well-orchestrated performance. The mRNA, much like a script, exits the nucleus (the scriptwriting room) and enters the cytoplasm (the stage), where it links up with ribosomes (the actors) which read the codons on the mRNA (the lines in the script) and match them to complementary tRNA molecules (props), each carrying a specific amino acid (costumes). These amino acids are then linked together in a growing chain by peptide bonds (the choreography), forming a protein (the final performance).	3a376a76fbb489dbf25161446641af61	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a well-executed recipe. The mRNA is like the chef emerging from the library (nucleus) with a new recipe (gene sequence), then it heads to the ribosome kitchen where they use tRNA ingredients to assemble the protein dish according to the mRNA recipe (translation), after which the protein - like a freshly cooked meal - undergoes folding and modifications (post-translation changes), before finally being sent out of the kitchento serve its function in the body.	aaf29b63af1760bfc34f5c2e8e7e9ee5	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis is a marvelous ballet, initiated as the mRNA, the prima ballerina, exits the stage of the nucleus. The first act begins with 'Transcription', where DNA's choreographed dance sequence is copied by RNA polymerase to create the mRNA. In the next scene, during the 'RNA Processing' step, this newly formed mRNA ballerina undergoes a dramatic costume change, splicing out introns and capping both ends to prepare for her performance. 'Translation', the third act, commences when mRNA pirouettes onto the ribosome stage in the cytoplasm, where her dance sequence is deciphered into amino acids. In the grand finale, these amino acids link together in a 'Protein Folding' process to form proteins, comparable to how individual steps weave together to produce a breathtaking ballet performance.	e7779f43b822701f356ebb89506d2853	-1	-1
5	Imagine the process of protein synthesis akin to a well-organised factory production line. The mRNA, much like a blueprint, leaves the control centre (nucleus), travels via the cell's transportation system (cytoplasm) to the ribosome (workstation), where tRNA (workers) decode its genetic instructions and assemble amino acids (raw materials) in a precise sequence to form a protein (finished product).	0be5199fe5718c0807a811196a6c4fdf	-1	-1
5	Oh, you're talking about protein synthesis, huh? Well, it starts with mRNA scootin' out of the nucleus faster than a Sox fan chasing a foul ball. Then, the ribosomes, they're like the Green Line during rush hour, pick up on that mRNA and start to translate it into amino acids, which are like different stops along the way. These amino acids link up tighter than a crowd at Fenway Park, forming a polypeptide chain. Lastly, this chain folds up quicker than a clam digger's bucket at low tide, creating the 3D structure of the protein.	8c80dd4411c435aa3d5822d1cb786184	-1	-1
5	"Alright, so let's start off with mRNA, which is like a message in a bottle that just escaped the island of the nucleus. First stop on its journey is a process named transcription, where our larny mRNA message gets rewritten into a simpler language by this ou called RNA polymerase - it's a bit like translating English to Afrikaans, you check? Then comes the second step, splicing, where all the unnecessary bits of the message get ""chopped"" out, sort of like when you cut out all the rubbish talk in a long Whatsapp voice note. After this, our mRNA hops on a ride with this thing called a ribosome in the third step of translation - it's like catching a taxi from Joburg to Durban, but instead of cities, it's moving from nucleotides to amino acids. Lastly, tRNA comes to play and helps link these amino acids together into one long chain - think of it as linking together boerewors pieces for a lekker braai. And voila! You've got your protein."	5999cbd731a77300c56eeeca30b50dd4	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? It's kind of like a hockey game. First, mRNA skates out of the nucleus like it's breaking away from its own end, carrying the game plan (the genetic code). Then, it glides over to the ribosome, that's the face-off circle where translation starts. Here the tRNA players, each holding an amino acid puck, read the mRNA's game plan one codon at a time, matching their anticodons with it in a precise as a well-executed play. This forms a polypeptide chain, similar to how a string of successful passes leads towards the goal. The polypeptide then folds into a functional protein, much like how those passes fold into a winning strategy.	37b30291eba9a07bdbe47284664032a1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA departure from the nucleus, is akin to a messenger delivering a crucial blueprint from an architect's office (nucleus) to a construction site. The construction site, or ribosome, scans the blueprint (mRNA); then, it orders necessary supplies (amino acids) brought by trucks (tRNA); finally, it assembles those supplies based on the plan, forming a new building (protein).	e3e8dba8f859908cc6b5fb155585305a	-1	-1
5	Awright, here's hou it gans. Think o' mRNA as a postie carrying a message fae the nucleus (the post office) tae the ribosome (the hoose). Step ane is transcription - that's when the DNA blueprint gets turned into yer mRNA message. Next up is translation, where the ribosome reads the message and starts building a protein (a bit like building a Lego model fae instructions), using transfer RNA to bring in the right amino acids. The third step is when these amino acids get joined together intae a polypeptide chain - imagine it like stringing beads ontae a necklace. Last but far frae least, this chain folds up intae its final 3D shape, just like how a flat piece of cloth can be folded up intae a fancy origami swan.	1482e78b851655587139f43c28e874d0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, is akin to a critical message being sent from the command center to the factory floor.  1. mRNA migration: This is equivalent to the dispatch of instructions, where mRNA, carrying the genetic blueprint, leaves the nucleus (the command center) heading towards the ribosome (factory floor). 2. Translation initiation: Like a worker starting their shift by clocking in, the ribosome attaches to the mRNA at a specific location (start codon) and prepares for protein assembly. 3. Elongation process: This mirrors the work of a skilled craftsman, as each codon on the mRNA dictates where an amino acid (building blocks) should be added, crafting a growing protein chain. 4. Termination and release: Much like a finished product being removed from an assembly line, once a stop codon on the mRNA is reached, the synthesised protein detaches from ribosome and proceeds to fold into its functional shape.	b3b9d8d3db967736b4657518306f0a90	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, akin to a well-orchestrated production in a theatre, begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus like an actor leaving the backstage to deliver his lines (transcription). On the cellular stage of a ribosome, mRNA's coded message (the script) is read and transformed into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins (translation), like prop makers backstage interpreting a design blueprint. These amino acids then undergo a process similar to costume fitting where they're assembled in the right order to form a protein (peptide bond formation). Lastly, just as actors give life to their characters through performance, so does this newly-synthesized protein as it folds into its unique shape, conferring its functionality (protein folding and processing).	00aa2aa2a9324c4e3e8d8ad21ef0d132	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis is a bit like preparing a traditional Irish stew, with mRNA leaving the nucleus as rare as hen's teeth. First, you have transcription in the nucleus, where DNA is used to make a complementary strand of mRNA, just like picking out the right ingredients for your stew. Next, the mRNA molecule moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm - that's like bringing your ingredients to the stove. The third step is translation, which happens at the ribosome and involves tRNA bringing amino acids to add to the growing protein chain, akin to adding your veg and meat to the pot one by one, cooking slowly. Lastly, post-translational modifications are made to finalize the protein structure, it's like adding those final touches of seasoning and letting it simmer until it's solid as the Rock of Cashel. But be careful not to do this arseways or you'll end up with a bad stew or worse, a faulty protein!	cfda43500588afdc458b72e9f5f16fde	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, you want the down-home version of this protein synthesis dance, huh? First off, that mRNA heads out from the nucleus like a hound dog on a coon's trail, carryin' coded directions. Then it runs into this ol' thing called a ribosome, more packed with parts than grandpappy's tool shed, where tRNA gathers up amino acids - those little building blocks - like a squirrel gatherin' nuts for winter. This tRNA matches up the amino acids with the mRNA code just like fitting pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. After all them pieces are stuck together in the right order, well, you've got yourself a brand new protein, sturdy as a prized heifer and ready to go to work! Now ain't that somethin'?	58d1b46b86be9d8780d9b14627670079	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a king leaving his castle, mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying coded information for protein assembly. 2. Ribosome Binding: Upon reaching the cytoplasm, mRNA binds to a ribosome like a key fitting into a lock. 3. tRNA Attachment: Like a messenger delivering specific parts, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to the ribosome based on the code in mRNA. 4. Protein Synthesis: The ribosome reads the mRNA code and connects the carried amino acids together like a factory assembling a product, leading to protein synthesis.	e0c87cbcfb61654ef7a954a9576a973d	-1	-1

Transcription: Similar to a scribe copying a manuscript, in the nucleus, the DNA's information is transcribed into mRNA. 2. mRNA processing: This could be compared to editing a rough draft of a document; non-coding regions (introns) are removed while coding regions (exons) are joined together. 3. Translation: Like translating a foreign language into your native tongue, the mRNA moves to the ribosome where tRNA molecules translate the genetic code into a protein sequence. 4. Protein Folding: Much like origami transforming a flat sheet of paper into a three-dimensional shape, the linear protein chain folds into its final three-dimensional structure which determines its function.	1e14be9254456526cdef0363ba69c7a6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a chef following a recipe. First, the mRNA (recipe) leaves the nucleus (recipe box) in a process called transcription. Second, it travels to the ribosomes (kitchen), where translation occurs and tRNA (ingredients) brings the necessary amino acids. Third, these amino acids are linked together in a specific order guided by the mRNA, forming a polypeptide chain (the dish being prepared).

Once in the 'kitchen', the 'chef' (ribosome) reads the 'recipe' (mRNA sequence), this stage is called translation initiation. 3. As per the recipe instructions, specific 'ingredients' (amino acids) are assembled in a particular order to form the 'dish' (protein), which represents elongation, translating mRNA into a sequence of amino acids. 4. Finally, the process stops when the 'end of recipe' signal is read, leading to protein release – known as translation termination and protein release.	7a813f37a218ac6410ee20129e1963b1	-1	-1

Protein Construction: Finally, similar to building blocks, these amino acids are linked together in a chain to form a protein molecule based on the original instructions from the mRNA.	531387f8ccb2b5d8ff5c0171049dc19e	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is a comprehensive answer using a metaphor: 1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is similar to a courier carrying a critical document from the head office to the factory floor. This process is called transcription. 2. The ribosome, acting like a skilled craftsman, reads the message carried by the mRNA in the cytoplasm, equivalent to reading detailed manufacturing instructions. This stage is known as translation initiation.  3. Then come along tRNAs, akin to diligent workers carrying the correct building blocks (amino acids), guided by the instructions on the mRNA blueprint. This is called elongation. 4. Finally, when the protein chain is complete, much like when all parts of a product are assembled correctly, it folds into its necessary 3-D structure and departs from the ribosome - this is termination. Thus, an efficient protein synthesis system functions much like a well-run assembly line in a factory.	2495f44ec093e46b51b3c0fa99356766	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to a culinary recipe, where the mRNA is the recipe leaving the head chef's office (the nucleus) and being passed on to the sous chefs (ribosomes). The chefs then gather all the necessary ingredients (amino acids), making sure they're in correct order according to the recipe (transcription), and finally fuse them together into a delicious dish (protein), through a process known as translation.	151bbc33a3fad79265b3a41f4c8548be	-1	-1
5	Well, let's kick off with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, that's like the referee throwing in the ball at the start of a hurling match. Next up, we've got translation where mRNA is read by the ribosome, a bit like reading the playbook. Then, tRNA brings in amino acids, similar to a midfielder bringing the sliotar up the field. Lastly, these amino acids are strung together to make a protein, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, and that's it - you're bang on with protein synthesis!	30a6ee997353586d07d3ed198562a6d2	-1	-1
5	Well, reckon it's like this: mRNA hightailin' it outta the nucleus is akin to a secret message leavin' HQ. Then, in this dance called translation, ribosomes—much like skilled craftsmen—read that there message and start piecin' together amino acids into a protein. These amino acids are kinda like beads on a necklace, strung together in just the right sequence. Lastly, our newly formed protein has gotta fold up right proper, sorta like origami, so it can do its job in the cell. Now ain't that somethin'?	316ef65f197222c9c9eace443e37d9fe	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: Like a royal decree leaving the castle, the messenger RNA (mRNA) departs from the nucleus carrying important genetic instructions. 2. Ribosome Reading: Then, the ribosome, acting like a skilled craftsman, reads these instructions carefully. 3. tRNA Matching: Transfer RNA (tRNA) works similar to a diligent courier, bringing the correct amino acids corresponding to the mRNA's instructions. 4. Protein Formation: Finally, these amino acids are assembled into a protein in a process akin to building blocks being systematically put together to construct a detailed structure.	42f9c3ba324dae3d5d5dea255b1e8c92	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a traveler leaving his home with a map, this map (mRNA) carries the instructions needed for protein construction. 2. Next step is translation, it's like decoding a secret message. Ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and translates it into amino acid sequence which forms a protein. 3. Now tRNA plays its role, imagine it as a delivery truck carrying the necessary building blocks (amino acids) to the construction site (ribosome). 4. The final step is protein folding, you can consider it as an artist giving final shape to his sculpture. The long chain of amino acids fold upon itself to form the unique shape of the protein that determines its function.	bb3e12f112ef29efb309c503602ed486	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exiting the nucleus can be likened to an architect carrying a blueprint from his office (nucleus) to the construction site. The creation of the protein is reliant on this 'blueprint'. 2. Translation, the next phase, is akin to a builder reading that blueprint and gathering all the necessary materials (amino acids). 3. Ribosomes, acting as the builders, now begin to construct the protein, which is comparable to assembling a building block by block. 4. Lastly, the protein undergoes folding and processing analogous to finishing touches being made to ensure the new building functions properly - doors open and close correctly, windows are sealed, etc.	2fcb3d020587eb847cbcaad2104be3fe	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Reaching Ribosomes: Like a blueprint leaving an architect's office, the mRNA, holding protein instructions, leaves the nucleus and finds a ribosome.  2. Translation: This is like the construction phase, where the ribosome reads the mRNA's instructions to assemble amino acids into a protein. 3. tRNA Involvement: The tRNA acts like delivery trucks, bringing the right amino acid needed by ribosome. 4. Protein Folding: In the end, it's like folding an origami where this long chain of amino acids folds onto itself to form a complex 3D structure which is the functional protein.	6f72b2e0ccd375aee373cc79f16a8dfe	-1	-1
5	Well, ya see, protein synthesis is kinda like buildin' a car in a factory. First off, mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus like a cat with its tail on fire, carryin' the instructions for makin' our protein. Next, we got translation, where mRNA teams up with ribosomes in the cytoplasm-- that's like the assembly line workers readin' the blueprint and startin' to piece things together. Then comes tRNA, which is like a delivery truck bringin' in the right parts (amino acids) at the right time. Last but not least, these amino acids are joined together to make a long chain, just like how all those car parts end up fit together to make a shiny new vehicle. And there ya have it, protein synthesis in a nutshell!	18b9a3acd545f398914c0d9ef4dd3894	-1	-1
5	Right, so protein synthesis is a bit like baking a cake. First off, ye've got mRNA scooting out the nucleus. That's like your recipe leaving the cookbook. Second, the ribosome reads the mRNA, which is like you reading your recipe. Then we have tRNA bringing in amino acids, this is akin to you gathering all your ingredients. Finally, the ribosome links these amino acids together to form a protein, just as you'd mix and bake your ingredients to get a cake!	4f2c7741ff0b3cd33cd8dcac1bd21e34	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, is akin to a messenger leaving a royal court with a blueprint. The four major steps include: 1) Transcription where DNA's information is converted into mRNA, like translating a cryptic blueprint into a universal language; 2) mRNA Processing where introns are removed and exons spliced together, similar to refining and double-checking the blueprint; 3) Translation where the processed mRNA is read by ribosomes and transformed into protein, much like builders interpreting and executing the blueprint instructions; 4) Protein Folding and Modification in which the young protein structure is folded into its functional shape and undergoes necessary modifications, comparable to the final touches on a newly built palace ensuring it is fit for purpose.	ee92b8d6c1492324e718233f20f001d5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a construction process. First, mRNA acts as the blueprint, exiting the nucleus to be read by the ribosomes (like project managers), who use tRNA (the delivery trucks) to bring in amino acids (building blocks) which then link together to form a protein, our final structure.	3c5a06c90e483fe5010d0656bfb1d9c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a complex recipe with mRNA as the ingredient list that leaves the nucleus kitchen. The four key steps are:  1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm (like an ingredient list being handed over to the cook);  2. Translation initiation where ribosomes decode the mRNA sequence (like reading and interpreting the recipe); 3. Elongation, where tRNA molecules match amino acids to codons on the mRNA (like a cook adding ingredients according to the recipe);  4. Termination, where protein synthesis ends once the stop codon is reached (similar to the finalization of cooking when all steps in the recipe have been performed).	0a93f9045ef30703ced1f83095b58c33	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis can be likened to a puzzle assembly line. First, mRNA is the blueprint exiting the nucleus (the manager's office), then it links with ribosomes (the puzzle assembly table), tRNA arrives next carrying specific amino acids (puzzle pieces), and finally, these amino acids are assembled in the correct order as dictated by mRNA (the instructions) to form a complete protein (the finished puzzle).	8c3d9645d6d3d19a6ed61d4948698ad7	-1	-1
5	Alright, so picture mRNA's journey like a Sox game at Fenway, alright? First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus - that's like our player leaving the dugout. Then it hits up the ribosome, or the 'pitcher', for translation - this is where it's read and translated into protein language. This is like the pitcher throwing the ball. Next, tRNA comes into play by carrying amino acids to the mRNA - kinda like a fielder catching a fly ball. Finally, these amino acids join together to form a protein chain - much like how our team joins forces to win the game!	0e13eb60b8642c86cd0620e3752c72b0	-1	-1
5	No worries, mate! So, imagine the protein synthesis process like a lekker braai we're having. First off, mRNA is like your mate who exits the house (nucleus) bringing the recipe instructions (genetic information). Then it's off to the ribosome, the braai stand where all action happens, known as translation. Your tRNA chommies bring along crucial ingredients - the amino acids. As they arrive sequentially, matching up with our recipe (mRNA sequence), they start building the protein, or in our case, stacking up those boerewors and chops on the grill. Lastly, just as you would give your meat a good old spice rubdown, post-translation modification happens where some bits are cut off or added to our protein to make it function properly. So there you have it: from nucleus to protein, as easy as flipping a wors on a hot summer's day!	fb5117c88b843a590fa8e08df76f13e5	-1	-1
5	Sure, protein synthesis is a bit like baking a cake. The mRNA leaving the nucleus is like your recipe leaving the cookbook. First, it heads to the ribosome (the kitchen), where tRNA (the baker) reads the recipe and starts gathering the correct amino acids (ingredients). These components are then linked together in a process called peptide bond formation, creating a polypeptide chain (the uncooked batter). This chain is then folded into a three-dimensional shape (like baking the cake) to create the final protein (the finished cake).	18bd979f646109d06ea69a94854664f8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like an intricate dance with four major steps:  1. mRNA Departure: The dance begins with mRNA, the blueprint of the protein to be synthesized, exiting the nucleus, just as a dancer enters the stage. 2. Translation Initiation: This is akin to the dancer finding their starting position; the mRNA attaches itself to a ribosome, the cellular machinery that will translate its information into a protein. 3. Elongation: Like a dancer moving across the stage, the ribosome reads along the mRNA sequence and links together amino acids in a chain, building the protein. 4. Termination and Release: Much like a dancer's final bow, once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA sequence, it releases the newly formed protein to go perform its function in the cell.	f87cb5903fb311accbb2c3676bed8ab8	-1	-1
5	Richt, here we gang. First off, mRNA flits oot the nucleus juist like a wee moose escaping fae a cat, carryin' th' blueprint for a protein. Next up, we hae th' ribosome, it's as eager as a dug on a walk, latches onto this mRNA an reads it. Thirdly, transfer RNA comes into play, each wan as unique as snowflakes in winter, bringin' th' right amino acids based on the mRNA's instructions. Finally, these amino acids get strung together like beads on a necklace by the ribosome to form th' final protein.	614baacecd55a3ac901215ddd0004ad5	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's the answer: 1. mRNA Transportation: Like a precious blueprint being sent from an architect's office (nucleus), the messenger RNA (mRNA) which carries the genetic code leaves the nucleus and reaches the cell's cytoplasm.     2. Translation Initiation: The mRNA then meets the ribosome – think of it like a construction site where the building (protein) will be built. 3. Elongation: This is similar to how bricklayers add one brick at a time, following the blueprint, to build a wall. The ribosome reads the mRNA in codons (groups of three bases) and for each codon, a matching amino acid is added to the growing protein chain. 4. Termination: When reaching a stop codon on the mRNA, much like when builders finish according to the plans and call it a day, the protein synthesis is stopped. The new protein is released and can now go fulfil its function in the body.	b040b7b943e50aa919b1f0d5ed61eb47	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, can be likened to a construction project. The mRNA serves as the blueprint, transferring the architectural design from the nucleus to the ribosome, which is the construction site (Translation). Thereafter, tRNA (akin to a delivery truck) brings in amino acids (building blocks) and matches them to the mRNA script (Codon-Anticodon recognition); these amino acids are then linked together to form a polypeptide chain (Peptide bond formation), just as bricks are systematically arranged in construction. Lastly, when the protein is fully built, it undergoes modifications and folding (Protein Processing) similar to post-construction touch-ups before the building is considered complete.	b4588d6fb19511085cb1154d7d6637dc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a highly-organised factory production line. To begin, mRNA, acting as the foreman with blueprints, leaves the nucleus (the manager's office) and heads to the ribosomes (workstations); the tRNA, functioning as diligent workers, gather specific amino acids (raw materials) using the mRNA's instructions for assembly; this assembly process, known as translation, creates a polypeptide chain (unfinished product); finally, this chain is sent to the Golgi apparatus (finishing department) where it folds into a functional protein structure (finished product), ready for use or export.	6edce5b2784aeb3c2533f1740676b421	-1	-1
5	Righto, look at protein synthesis like cooking up the perfect stew in your kitchen. mRNA bolts from the nucleus to the ribosomes like a greyhound outta the traps, that's your recipe for the stew being readied. Then comes transcription where the RNA serves as a template for creating a complementary strand of DNA; think of it as gathering up all of your ingredients. After this, translation steps up - it's like taking those ingredients and combining them to form a chain of amino acids, or your delicious stew. Finally, we've got protein folding, which is much like letting that stew simmer on the hob till all the flavours meld together and you're left with a fully functional protein - or in our case, a tasty dish that's been donkey's years in the making!	5da34257c494696add35a7f60f63e169	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, imagine you're bakin' a biscuit. The recipe (mRNA) leaves the recipe box (nucleus), gets read by our head chef - the ribosome - who then gathers ingredients like amino acids, with the help of tRNA. Then, they start mixin' those ingredients in the right order (translation), and Voila! You got yourself a fresh protein biscuit (protein synthesis)!	d9a866c4f4370dbe94440cb0d32f36a4	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus is akin to a detailed blueprint leaving the architect's office, full of instructions for the construction of a building - this step is called transcription. 2. Then, like a well-trained courier, it travels to the ribosome, the 'construction site', in a process known as mRNA processing. 3. The ribosome reads the instructions given by mRNA and assembles amino acids accordingly in a procedure that can be likened to workers placing bricks according to a blueprint, which is referred to as translation. 4. Finally, a string of these amino acids folds onto itself forming a functional protein, just like how individual bricks come together to form a robust structure - this process is termed as protein folding.	f81723913d62e926a3b83aaed93aa10a	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaving de nucleus be like a sailor setting sail, carrying the treasure map for the protein. Two, it links to ribosomes in the cytoplasm; this be like the sailor reaching his ship, ready for his journey. Three, translation starts, where tRNA molecules act as translators of the map, interpreting the mRNA code into amino acids - it's like the crew deciphering the map and finding the treasure pieces. Four, these amino acids join together creating a polypeptide chain - that be like joining all those found treasures into one precious necklace we call protein.	61d45532c8aeeb511b2d0dff84a951fd	-1	-1
5	Sure, here is the simplified description of the protein synthesis process.  1. mRNA Exit from Nucleus: Much like a manager leaving their office to give tasks to workers, mRNA (messenger RNA) departs from the nucleus carrying the genetic instructions for protein production.  2. Translation Initiation: In the cellular 'factory' called the ribosome, translation begins when mRNA pairs with a molecule named tRNA (transfer RNA), similar to a worker collecting tools for a job. 3. Elongation: Like building blocks being added to a construction project, amino acids are collected by tRNA and added one by one to form a growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination and Release: The final step is akin to completing a project and cleaning up the worksite. Once the entire protein has been synthesized, it's released into the cell where it can fulfill its function. The ribosome then separates back into its subunits, ready for another round of protein synthesis.	cd95ead04e0af393ac6df8afb4fec54b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departure: Like a messenger on a mission, the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic instructions from DNA.  2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosome acts like a reader, decoding the message on mRNA into amino acid sequence. 3. tRNA transfer: This is similar to delivery trucks, where tRNA brings specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the code. 4. Protein formation: Amino acids are stitched together like beads on a string, forming a polypeptide chain which folds into a protein.	8a74025d290fba800cd636cec0335e82	-1	-1
5	You betcha! So, first off, ya got yer mRNA skedaddling from the nucleus like a jackrabbit on a date. Then it tugs along to the ribosome, which is kinda like our kitchen where all the cookin' happens. Next step's called translation, that's when the ribosome reads that mRNA like you'd read a recipe and starts puttin' together those amino acids into a protein. It's like knittin' a scarf outta different yarns. Last but not least, once your protein's built, it goes through this process we call folding - it shapes itself up nice and proper so it can do its job right. If it don't fold right, well then you're tryin' to put lipstick on a pig - ain't gonna work too good.	e089a7e12b7074d0dd690da9af66cdbf	-1	-1
5	Well, firstly we've got transcription happ'nin right in the nucleus, where the mRNA takes a wee template from the DNA, a bit like takin' a shopping list from yer ma. Next up, it's off tae the cytoplasm as quick as a whippet, or it'll get stuck in as heavy traffic as Buchanan Street on a Saturday. Once there, it meets up wi' the ribosome, think of them like two daft pals at the pub catching up, and this is where translation happens. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and with help fae transfer RNA (tRNA), they build the protein like a brickie builds a wall - one amino acid at a time. Finally, once our protein is built strong as a lion, it's folded into its proper shape by chaperone proteins; you can picture this like foldin' a kilt neatly for a big night out.	8e553eef0d6e31bb92f2efad1fdd092d	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome is like an important message being carried from government headquarters to a factory, where it lays out precise instructions. 2. On arrival, tRNA acts as translators, converting the language of nucleic acids in the mRNA into the language of amino acids, akin to interpreters at an international conference. 3. The ribosome then serves as a workshop, sequentially assembling each amino acid provided by tRNA into a chain, much like a production line in a factory. 4. Once complete, the protein, like a final product coming off an assembly line, folds into its unique shape and begins its function within the cell.	41e087a0168f00f95fd152b38e08eaf7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a beautiful dance that begins when mRNA, the dance instructor, exits the nucleus with choreography instructions. The first step is called transcription where within the nucleus itself, DNA, the original choreographer, passes its sequence to mRNA; afterward, in a step called post-transcriptional modification, unnecessary parts of the dance routine are edited out from mRNA. Then comes translation - the ribosomes (the dancers) interpret these instructions into amino acids (or dance moves), which then through a process called peptide bond formation, come together to perform a complete protein-dance routine.	f6dc098656835def9525ebf2755f8c2e	-1	-1
5	"Sure, here's an analogy to explain the process. Protein synthesis is like baking a cake, where mRNA is the recipe that leaves the ""kitchen"" or nucleus. Step one: Transcription, is the chef reading the recipe and creating a copy (the pre-mRNA). Step two: Splicing, involves refining this recipe by removing unnecessary parts (introns). Step three: Translation, is the actual baking step, where the refined recipe is read in the ribosome oven and ingredients (amino acids) are added sequentially based on the instructions. The final step: Folding and Processing, is like giving the baked cake its shape and decorations which makes it ready for serving, similarly proteins are folded into specific shapes necessary for their function."	8200bc5b144904c1473c2db4ceedaf7f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus, is much like a construction project.  1. Export from Nucleus (Site Planning): The mRNA, akin to the blueprint of a building, leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, setting the stage for action. 2. Ribosome Assembly (Gathering Workers): Ribosomal units latch onto the mRNA, much like workers gathering at the construction site ready to interpret the blueprints. 3. Translation (Building Process): Amino acids are brought by tRNA and assemble according to the mRNA sequence, similar to builders constructing a structure brick by brick based on plans. 4. Protein Folding (Final Touches): The newly formed protein then folds into its unique shape, much like adding the final architectural touches to a newly built structure.	12209fb70a307dbf450acbd5a126e277	-1	-1
5	Oh, sure thing! So ya got this whole protein synthesis thing kickin' off with the mRNA headin' out from the nucleus, kinda like a Sox fan leavin' Fenway after a big win. First stop is translation, where the mRNA's code is read faster than a Red Line train at rush hour by the ribosome. Second, we got transfer RNA (tRNA) comin' into play, carryin' amino acids to the mRNA like a duck boat in a victory parade. Third step's like a wicked intricate game of Tetris, with these amino acids linkin' together in a specific order to form a polypeptide chain. Fourth and finally, that chain then folds into a specific shape - just like how we Bostonians bundle up come wintertime – creatin' the final protein. It's all one wicked smaht process that makes life tick.	c9cbdcebd6ba9128b22c4b12138674c4	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, buddy! Right, so protein synthesis is a lot like making boerewors at a braai. Step one, mRNA bails the nucleus, just like leaving your house to buy wors from the butcher. Next step, mRNA joins the ribosome, or fires up the braai stand. Thirdly, tRNA brings amino acids to this party, like adding all your lekker spices to your wors mix. Lastly, these amino acids bond together creating a polypeptide chain, which is just like when you finally get to eat that juicy piece of boerewors. Ja nee, that's the basics of protein synthesis!	6f2b6f7900c0afb3f84c364c654cb54d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, let's use the hockey game as an analogy to explain this complex process!  1. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a hockey player hitting the ice ready to play - it carries coded instructions from DNA (the Coach) on how to construct the protein.  2. Translation, carried out by the ribosome (the Goalie), is like reading a play-by-play, where the mRNA code is used to assemble amino acids into a protein.  3. tRNA (the Wingers) bring specific amino acids (the puck) to the ribosome, guided by the mRNA sequence (the playbook).  4. Once all the right moves are made and the protein (the final score) is assembled, it's folded into its specific shape (victory lap), which determines what it can do in our bodies—the crowd goes wild!	79d11dd9b640c9c234526576b6b5fdaf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is much like a well-orchestrated symphony. Beginning with the 'conductor', mRNA, leaving the nucleus, it first calls on 'musicians', ribosomes, to interpret its coded message (translation), then tRNA or 'sheet music' delivers the correct amino acids in sequence, like notes in a melody (charging of tRNA). These amino acids are linked together (peptide bond formation) to form a beautiful composition, the protein. Finally, the protein undergoes 'rehearsals' (folding and processing) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus before it's ready for its final performance - executing functions within or outside the cell.	991faf52d84984a0335ca29550242c4d	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae let's think on this like a guid auld Scots recipe. First off, mRNA bides its time in the nucleus afore takin' a mosey on oot tae the cytoplasm - that's yer ingredients bein' picked up fae the cupboard. Next up, the ribosome gets tae work, readin' the mRNA like a cook would a recipe book - translation, ken? Then we've got tRNA bringin' in specific amino acids - that's like fetchin' the right spices for yer stew. Finally, these amino acids bind thegither to form a protein - similar to how all yer ingredients come thegither to make a grand dish!	4123d79e57d72f02efc9d71974f347fa	-1	-1
5	Sure, the protein synthesis process is quite similar to cooking a meal in your kitchen.  1. mRNA exit from the nucleus: It's like the recipe leaving the cookbook shelf and coming to your hands, the mRNA carries the genetic information (the recipe) from the DNA (the cookbook) in the nucleus (the shelf) to the cytoplasm (the kitchen). 2. Translation initiation: This is the moment where you start gathering your ingredients; ribosomes (the cooks) attach to the mRNA (recipe) and start 'reading' it to assemble amino acids (ingredients) in the correct order. 3. Elongation: As you adding more and more ingredients, this phase corresponds to adding each amino acid (ingredient) to the growing polypeptide chain (the dish being made), based on what’s written on the mRNA (recipe). 4. Termination: Finally, like when you finish cooking and take your dish off the stove, the protein synthesis ends when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA signalling that the protein (meal) is complete, and can now fold into its functional form and perform its role within the cell (served at table).	62087efab1d7ec5c5efeb8d73262b18c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a highly coordinated production line in a factory. The first step can be likened to the blueprints (mRNA) leaving the design office (nucleus), followed by ribosomes acting as the machines that read these blueprints and create a structure called the polypeptide chain, this is akin to assembling the product parts. Then comes the tRNA, which is like the workers bringing in the right amino acids (components) at the correct time to add to this chain. Lastly, after assembly, the final protein structure is folded and modified, similar to adding finishing touches on the product before it's ready for use in the cell.	dfa12e20b18f87d1124eac9202f64d1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated production in a theatre. First, the mRNA, resembling the script, departs from the nucleus (the scriptwriter's room) and travels to the ribosome (the stage), where it's read and interpreted by tRNA (the actors), resulting in the creation of an amino acid chain (the performance). This chain then folds into a unique shape creating the protein (the show's finale), determined by its specific sequence of amino acids, acting like the play's plot.	0510461ad8ed615b9fd2292833cb3600	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, the journey of mRNA is a bit like a wee lad on his first day of work. Firstly, he leaves the comfort of home - that's our mRNA leaving the nucleus. Then he gets on the bus, or in this case, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome - that's known as translation initiation. Now he's at work - like when the tRNA matches up with the mRNA to start creating the protein, we call it elongation. Finally, he knocks off for the day and heads back home - just like when the protein is released in termination. You wouldn't want to be getting things arseways and skipping any steps now, would ya?	64e5eca489a889c6fd7a5a64fc9d276b	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart! I reckon the process of protein synthesis is a bit like makin' Aunt Sally's famous apple pie. The recipe starts with mRNA leavin' the nucleus just like you'd fetch the apples from the orchard. Then comes transcription where the DNA message gets copied into mRNA, that's sorta like peelin' and corin' those apples. Next, we got translation which takes place in ribosomes - think of it as mixin' all your ingredients together. Lastly, the protein folds into its final shape, kinda like how the pie gets its perfect crust after bakin'. And there ya have it! That's protein synthesis for y'all.	3ea8d3954f3eb0a7adce6822bf3015cc	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey from the nucleus to the ribosome is like a blueprint moving from the architect's office to the construction site.  2. Once at the ribosome, the mRNA's codon sequence gets translated into amino acids, much like how a coded message would be deciphered. 3. These amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds in a process akin to stringing pearls on a necklace. 4. Finally, with aid from chaperone proteins that act like skilled craftsmen, these strings fold into unique shapes to become functional proteins.	5a4147b18985e0e3ddf1e59bc81e2549	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA slip out the nucleus like man fleeing from storm, carrying the genetic message. Second step, mRNA join up with ribosome, like how we link at big family cookout. Third step, tRNA bring amino acids to the mRNA-ribosome link-up, like delivering ingredients for potjie. Fourth and final step, the ribosome connect them amino acids together to make protein, same way we string together words to create a story.	3cfea3a4fcb6f8e387ebc0ed9f58612e	-1	-1
5	1. Transcript Export: The post-transcriptional mRNA leaves the nucleus, much like an outgoing mail from a post office, to provide essential blueprints for protein synthesis. 2. Translation Initiation: Acting like a construction team waiting for the blueprints, ribosomes in the cytoplasm bind to the mRNA to decode its instructions. 3. Elongation: This is akin to following the blueprint as tRNA brings specific amino acids to the ribosome to construct the protein chain. 4. Termination and Release: Upon reaching a stop codon, similar to a project completion signal, the newly formed protein detaches from the ribosome, ready for further processing or function.	c364b640ca8ef261c371c8aeca66502f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transport: Like a courier carrying an important message, mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: This is like a key (mRNA) fitting into a lock (ribosome), where it will be read and translated. 3. Translation: It's just like decoding a secret language - the ribosome reads the mRNA's codons and translates them into amino acids. 4. Protein Folding: Like origami, the chain of amino acids folds into a complex 3D shape to form the protein.	eda1eb6a513493f1d78c66958f7dc44d	-1	-1
5	Well, ain't this just a hoot! Alright, here we go.  1. First off, mRNA scoots out of the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date, carrying genetic info it got from DNA. 2. Next, like herding cats, mRNA finds its way to the ribosomes where it'll serve as the blueprint for protein synthesis.  3. Then we got tRNA, which is kind of like a boxcar carrying amino acids to the ribosome assembly line. 4. Lastly, inside the ribosome, these amino acids get linked together in the order dictated by the mRNA – like trying to put lipstick on a pig, it can be tricky but when it's done we've got ourselves a brand new protein!	3d4affceeabd222a702b883985ec01e8	-1	-1
5	Right, so think of this like a spicy haggis journey. First, mRNA is like the recipe card, it scoots out of the nucleus (the kitchen), into the cytoplasm (dining area). Then, tRNA comes along, acting like waitstaff carrying specific amino acids (ingredients). The ribosomes are like chefs reading the mRNA recipe and using tRNA ingredients to assemble the protein (our haggis dish). Finally, once cooking is done, our protein is released to be used or transported elsewhere in our body's restaurant.	5eb0ed7ac92ef32e3444913b4aa54c6e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit: The transcribed mRNA, akin to a coded message, departs the nucleus carrying genetic instructions.  2. Ribosome Attachment: This message docks at the ribosome, the cellular equivalent of a factory assembly line.  3. Translation: As per the mRNA's instructions, the ribosome reads and translates this into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, much like interpreting a foreign language.  4. Protein Folding: Finally, these amino acids fold up into complex 3D structures, creating proteins - much like folding flat sheets of paper into intricate origami shapes.	2a5479b4cdacb2dacb4da98313c38a1e	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's the process of protein synthesis simplified into four main steps. 1. mRNA Departure: Think of mRNA as a secret agent carrying classified information (in this case, genetic code) from the nucleus (HQ) to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Reading: The ribosome is like a factory worker who reads blueprints (mRNA) line by line (codon by codon), interpreting the instructions to assemble something (a protein). 3. tRNA Assistance: The tRNA acts like delivery trucks, ferrying necessary resources (amino acids) to the construction site (ribosome), based on the specific orders from the blueprint (mRNA). 4. Protein Construction: Finally, using those resources provided by tRNAs, the ribosome stitches together a unique product (polypeptide chain or protein), just like a tailor sewing together a custom-made outfit piece by piece.	aeb8ee2efeb82edc0ccd6859dc380c94	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Exit and Ribosome Attachment: The mRNA, like a traveler, embarks on its journey from the nucleus, carrying the genetic blueprint necessary to create proteins.  2. Translation Initiation: Arriving at the ribosome— the factory of protein synthesis — makes it analogous to a worker reporting for duty, the mRNA's vital information is prepared to be translated. 3. Elongation: This stage is akin to an assembly line in a factory, where tRNA molecules bring specific amino acids (the building blocks) in accordance with the mRNA blueprint to construct the growing protein chain. 4. Termination: Like the end of a workday in our factory analogy, once the protein chain is complete as indicated by a stop codon on the mRNA, it's released and the process concludes.	33267f764a9e1b4a441b5f0c83bb8423	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex procedure that can be likened to a chef following a recipe. mRNA leaving the nucleus acts as the recipe, which is read and followed by the ribosomes (the chefs). The process involves four major steps: 1. Transcription: This is akin to writing down the recipe you intend to follow, as DNA in the nucleus is transcribed into mRNA.     2. mRNA Processing: Comparable to double-checking the recipe for any errors and making necessary alterations, this step ensures the mRNA is ready for translation.     3. Translation: Much like the chef actually combining ingredients to create the dish, this step sees tRNA and ribosomes translating the genetic code on the mRNA into amino acids to form polypeptides. 4. Protein Folding: Imagine the final plating and presentation of the dish in a restaurant; similarly here, these polypeptides fold into their specific functional shapes to form proteins.	74f596b9782730279633815dfd878ff8	-1	-1
5	Awright, so picture it like this: mRNA bolts from the nucleus, faster than a Sox fan from a Yankees game. First off, it teams up with a ribosome in a process called translation - it's like finding your mate at Fenway. This is where tRNA comes into play, delivering amino acids to the mRNA, just like a Dunkies delivery guy dropping off your regular order. Next thing you know, these amino acids are strung together in a polypeptide chain, more tangled up than the T during rush hour. Lastly, the new protein goes through post-translational modifications, getting primped and prepped like you're heading out for a night in the North End.	1680a786138607c58ec39445e443a172	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's break it down like a game of rugby, mate. First off, the mRNA gets picked up quick-quick from the nucleus, kind of like a scrum-half grabbing the ball. It then makes its way to the ribosome - that's our try line here. Now comes the translation phase, where tRNA reads the mRNA - think of this as our winger reading the field, high as the Drakensberg. The tRNA also brings along specific amino acids - just like your teammates bringing their unique skills to the match. Lastly, these amino acids are stitched together to form a protein, much like how a solid team effort leads to scoring a try. So there you have it chommie, it's just like a lovely game of footy!	e87e1c2f73245aa15bfa02d9c56de595	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is like a skilled hockey player moving across the rink. First, mRNA, like our star player, exits the nucleus (the bench), then it moves to a ribosome (the puck) in the cytoplasm (on ice). After this, tRNA (teammates) carrying specific amino acids (hockey gear) attach to the mRNA at the ribosome and form a protein chain (game play), following the instructions of the mRNA just as a team follows their coach's game strategy. Lastly, once the protein is synthesized (goal is scored), it undergoes post-translational modifications (team celebration and review of tactics) where it's refined for its specific role in the cell (or role on the team).	b6e3fe125036e8fafcfdf4c62e3bb406	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is akin to a well-orchestrated assembly line. mRNA leaving the nucleus is like a blueprint departing the architect's office, followed by translation in the ribosome being the construction site where amino acids, the building blocks, are assembled into proteins based on the blueprint, and finally modifications in the Golgi apparatus resemble the finishing touches added by skilled craftsmen to ensure functionality.	390c5bb67f7cd9b4360a82bc7057734b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts wi' mRNA hittin' the road fae the nucleus, a bit like yon postie deliverin' a letter. It’s then used by ribosomes as a blueprint (think o' them as wee builders) to assemble amino acids intae a protein, very much like how a team of brickies use blueprints to build a hoose. This process is called translation. Then comes post-translational modification, which is like addin’ the final touches to that hoose - paintin', decoratin’, an’ all that. Finally, the new protein is sent to where it’s needed in the cell, just as you'd move into your brand new hoose once it's ready.	97b911cf72bded76966d03995ee2c077	-1	-1
5	Sure, I can provide an answer to the question. 1. mRNA Transport: Once mRNA has been produced within the nucleus via transcription, it travels out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. This is akin to a master blueprint being sent out from the head office to the factory floor where actual production takes place. 2. Ribosome Attachment: The mRNA molecule attaches itself to a ribosome, which can be visualized as a workstation or workbench in our factory analogy, where assembly of the product will occur. 3. Translation: During translation, tRNA molecules, acting like diligent delivery trucks, read the code on the mRNA (the blueprint) and bring in the correct amino acids (parts for assembly) in the right sequence. 4. Polypeptide Chain Formation: These amino acids link together to form a polypeptide chain - our final product, just like individual car parts would be assembled in sequence to form a complete car in a manufacturing unit. Each step is critical and highly regulated to ensure that proteins are correctly synthesized as per the body's requirements, much like every step in a factory assembly line is crucial for producing a functional product.	0c3b72ac14551c1879630fe22eb4ff61	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, is akin to a master chef following a recipe to create a dish. Firstly, mRNA, like an encoded copy of the recipe, leaves the nucleus (the original recipe book) and travels into the cytoplasm (the kitchen). Secondly, ribosomes (the chefs) interpret this mRNA code (recipe instructions), in a process called translation. Thirdly, transfer RNA or tRNA (sous-chefs) bring specific amino acids (ingredients) to the ribosome according to the mRNA code. Fourthly, these amino acids are linked together in a specific order to form a polypeptide chain (dish), eventually folding to create the final protein (completed culinary masterpiece).	399bc21e3f49cbd172117f7e01d2df04	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, can be likened to a complex recipe in a grand kitchen. The mRNA, like a detailed recipe, leaves the control centre (nucleus), travels to the cook (ribosome) in the cytoplasm who interprets it (translation), and collects ingredients (amino acids) delivered by tRNA (like kitchen runners), to craft the final dish (the protein).	ce3892be0d61f61097e188deb04de677	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's take a roll in the hay with this one. First off, mRNA, as rare as hen's teeth, makes a daring escape from the nucleus. Then like a well-trained dog, it finds its spot on the ribosome for the next bit of craic, translation. In translation, tRNA, the local gossip of the cell, brings the right amino acids based on the codon it's matching to - it's a quare precise process now! Finally, those amino acids are linked together to form a protein, much like beads on a string, and then it's off on the never never to perform its function in the cell.	331a4b48a4f6741653877e9cfb65ff8a	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, think of protein synthesis like hosting a big ol' Southern barbecue. First off, mRNA is like your invite--it hightails it out of the nucleus (that'd be your house). Then it goes to the ribosome (the party spot), where tRNA (those are your caterers) bring in amino acids (all that mouth-watering food). Now, the ribosome joins these amino acids together in the order specified by the mRNA - that's like you layin' out your spread on the table. Last but not least, once all those fixin's are connected, they fold into a unique structure (kinda like how a good casserole comes together), and voila! You got yourself a protein (or in our case, a feast ready to be enjoyed).	92b1025c4e123531f3e7486e9d59d698	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's exit from the nucleus can be likened to a detailed blueprint leaving an architect's office, ready to guide the creation of a building. 2. The process of translation at the ribosomes is similar to a 3D printer interpreting a digital design and constructing an object layer by layer, where in this case, the object is a protein. 3. The tRNA's role of matching amino acids to codons on the mRNA is like a diligent worker who collects specific building materials according to the blueprint instructions. 4. Finally, protein folding into its functional 3D form is akin to an origami artist meticulously folding a flat piece of paper into a complex three-dimensional sculpture, giving it its unique shape and function.	82242dcadc59e9a0ea7576e96b0b06cf	-1	-1
5	Alright, mi go explain now. Mi see protein synthesis like a grand market day, yuh see? Step one, mRNA leave nucleus like man leavin' he house to go market. Step two, mRNA join up with ribosome in cytoplasm; that's like man reachin' market stall. Third step, tRNA bring amino acids, just like vendors bring goods to the stall. Last step, them amino acids link up to form protein--like products sell off and customer walk away happy with full basket. So there yuh have it, four steps inna protein synthesis.	7a18f6159588df6483064820939a3bd5	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaving the nucleus: Think of mRNA as a messenger on a mission, carrying the genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus, the command center of our cell, to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, much like an envoy delivering royal decrees. 2. Ribosome reads mRNA: The ribosome, acting as a complex decoding machine, reads the instructions on the mRNA, akin to reading a recipe to know what ingredients are needed. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: tRNA is like an efficient delivery truck, bringing the necessary amino acids to the ribosome based on the instructions from mRNA. 4. Polypeptide chain forms: The amino acids are then stitched together by ribosomes to form a long polypeptide chain, similar to stringing beads onto a thread to make an exquisite necklace. This chain will then fold into a functional protein.	042998ae5988f9f867bf42acbafac663	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Just like a letter leaving the post office, mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic information to the ribosomes. 2. Translation: This step is like interpreting a foreign language, where ribosome decodes the mRNA sequence into amino acids. 3. Polypeptide Formation: Similar to building blocks being joined together, the amino acids are connected in a specific order forming a polypeptide chain. 4. Protein Folding: Like origami, the polypeptide chain folds into a unique shape that forms the final protein with its unique function.	a2a21253b12a2ce63931e1f920dd08eb	-1	-1
5	Oh, you're askin' 'bout protein synthesis! Well, imagine it like this: mRNA scootin' out of the nucleus is like a mailman leavin' the post office with a stack of letters (that's your genetic instructions right there). First stop, ribosomes latch onto that mRNA like a kid on a corn dog - that's called Translation. Our buddy tRNA swings by next, toting specific amino acids in tow just like a farmer haulin' his harvest to market - this is Amino Acid coupling. Then, those amino acids get strung together faster than a gossip spreads in small town; we call this Polypeptide formation. And lastly, that long chain folds up quicker than a jackrabbit on a hot date, forming our final protein. That's the Protein Folding part. Now isn't that slicker than snot on a glass doorknob?	aeedd0724b6553963bbb34d3076e2c02	-1	-1
5	Well, you could think of this process like a wee journey from the Highlands to Glasgow. First, your mRNA's like a tour guide, it leaves the nucleus (the cosy Highland cottage) with the blueprint for the protein (tour itinerary). Second stop is the ribosome in the cytoplasm (our tour bus), which reads this blueprint. Then we have the tRNA (like our friendly bus driver), it brings the right amino acids (visitors) to the ribosome based on the mRNA's instructions. Lastly, these amino acids are strung together like a daisy chain at a summer fair to form a protein, completing our epic trek!	c5e00b12789f5e4abfae8f76ca3605ab	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's departure from the nucleus is akin to a ship setting sail, carrying vital information (or the genetic code) needed for protein synthesis.  2. Once it reaches its destination - the cytoplasm - it's like the ship docking at a port, a place called the ribosome where the process of translation begins - kind of like unloading its cargo. 3. Here, tRNA enters the picture acting like little trucks that deliver specific amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), to the ribosome based on the code from mRNA, much like delivering cargo based on shipping instructions. 4. Finally, these amino acids are linked together in a chain making up a specific protein. This is similar to a construction site where all materials delivered are assembled according to a blueprint to create a structure - in this case, our protein!	5afa049908581d091aa49fb6e01bafd8	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exiting the nucleus is akin to a courier carrying an important message from the command center to the factory floor. 2. The next stage is transcription, which functions like a decoder, interpreting the instructions conveyed by mRNA to assemble specific units known as amino acids. 3. In translation, the cell's machinery (ribosome) works similarly to a skilled worker on an assembly line, putting together these amino acids to form a protein following the blueprint provided by mRNA. 4. Lastly, like quality control in manufacturing, post-translational modifications ensure the newly formed protein is correctly folded and functional before it's put to work in the cell.	747b11b018d16d96a51a37d1da30c3c5	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis is like a recipe, with mRNA as the blueprint. First, mRNA leaves the nucleus, acting like an errand runner carrying recipe instructions from the brain to the kitchen. Second, it arrives at the ribosome in the cytoplasm, which is the chef ready to follow the recipe. Thirdly, tRNA, or the kitchen helper, collects and brings the necessary amino acids to the ribosome. Lastly, these ingredients (amino acids) are assembled in a specific order as dictated by mRNA to create a unique dish, which in our case is a protein.	cc26a4125bd3e581101dad798410eb1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, can be likened to a play production. The mRNA, playing the role of a scriptwriter, exits the nucleus (the script-writing room) and travels to the ribosome (the stage), where tRNA (the actors) read and interpret its coded message (the script) during translation. The amino acids they carry are joined together to form a protein (the performance) in a process known as peptide bond formation. After the protein is formed, it undergoes post-translational modifications (rehearsals and edits to the performance) before it's ready for its function (the actual performance).	7e6c539e299a032dddf1e515d3a8ef2a	-1	-1
5	"Alright, ya lookin' for the play-by-play on protein synthesis, here's how it goes down, starting with mRNA bustin' outta the nucleus like the Sox hittin' Fenway: 1) Firstly, that mRNA, fresh outta the nucleus, grabs a Lyft over to the ribosomes. This moment is like packin' up your gear and heading down to the Garden for the big game—it's where all the action is gonna happen. 2) Secondly, we got ourselves what scientists call ""transcription"", but I like to think of it as layin' down the blueprints. It's like when Coach Belichick lays out the playbook for the Pats – every play (or in this case, codon) gets paired up with just the right player (or amino acid). 3) Then we're onto translation - this is where them amino acids get strung together into a protein chain, akin to how Dunkin's strings together all us Bostonians with our daily dose of donuts and coffee. 4) Lastly, after translation, post-translational modifications happen. They're like Boston's infamous potholes — they might cause a bit of a bump, but they shape the final structure and function of that new protein, making it stronger than a Southie dockworker and primed for its job in the cell.  There you have it - protein synthesis in Boston terms!"	ef269702417e8df846670c82b2659988	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mate. So, imagine protein synthesis as a lekker braai. First off, mRNA, the recipe for our boerewors, leaves the kitchen (nucleus) and heads to the braai area (cytoplasm). Step two is like getting all your ingredients (amino acids) in order through translation. Uh-oh! We've got an intruder - a stop codon that tells us the wors is ready. Lastly, our wors (protein) gets properly folded so it cooks just right. Quick-quick but slow as a wet week, hey?	e228158a23e8c4cb194933b6683b68cb	-1	-1
5	"Sure thing, eh? Protein synthesis is a bit like a hockey game. Firstly, the mRNA leaves the ""dressing room"" (nucleus) with a ""game plan"" (genetic information). Second up, it hits the ""ice"" (cytoplasm) where it meets the ""player"" (ribosome) that reads this plan. Thirdly, tRNA, acting like a ""zamboni"", brings in the ""pucks"" (amino acids). Lastly, these pucks are put together to score a ""goal"" (a new protein)! That's the long and short of it."	d0cfb5cbe0a5f94b5ef100ae9bc25873	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a complex, beautiful dance that begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus stage. The first step is transcription where our star, mRNA, gets its script from the DNA director in the nucleus, then it heads out to the cytoplasm. The next step is translation, where mRNA meets up with ribosome, the choreographer, who reads its script and starts arranging the amino acids - the dancers. The tRNA, or transport RNA, are like the fleet of taxis that bring each new dancer (amino acid) to the stage. Finally, as each amino acid joins the sequence they form a polypeptide chain, creating a spectacular formation dance - our finished protein.	e4aedf07a2c0eec25ed36d48f2f81fd1	-1	-1
5	Weel, tak this in mind. First ye've got yer mRNA skitin' oot the nucleus, right? It's a pure sprinter, racin' tae meet the ribosome. That's step one. Now, once thon ribosome claps eyes on it, we're onto step twa - it starts readin' the mRNA like a guid book, translatin' its code intae amino acids. So now we've got these amino acids, right? They're needin' tae be strung together, a bit like beads on a necklace - that's us at step three, the polypeptide chain formation. Finally, these chains fold up intae a specific shape tae become a functional protein - hink o' it as foldin' up a jumper for storage. And there ye have it - frae the nucleus tae a neat pile of proteins!	d0b6b019d3889ef371fcac2422f73f81	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, the process of creating proteins, is like a four-step dance with mRNA as our main dancer.  1. The first step is 'Transcription', where mRNA gets created within the nucleus, a bit like a blueprint being drawn in the architect's office. 2. The next step, 'mRNA Processing', is akin to finalizing and proofreading the blueprint before it leaves the nucleus; any errors are corrected and unnecessary parts are removed.  3. After this comes 'Translation', where mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, much like a contractor bringing the blueprint to the construction site. 4. Finally, 'Protein Folding' occurs, where the proteins take their final shape, similar to how raw building materials become a finished building according to the blueprint.	d379b609a39cabd6dcc2111946051664	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-orchestrated ballet performance. The mRNA, as the prima ballerina, exits the nucleus stage, it performs a dance named transcription with the assistance of the RNA polymerase; then it pirouettes towards the cytoplasm where it partners with the ribosome for a duet called translation. With tRNA's aide, similar to costume changes in a performance, specific amino acids are delivered and attached together forming beautiful chains that are proteins, concluding our magnificent ballet.	9a31bc27b3a74faeed0e19c7ded991bb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like assembling a car with mRNA serving as the blueprint that exits the control room (nucleus). Four major steps include: transcription where the DNA's code gets copied into the blueprint (mRNA); RNA processing which is akin to checking and editing the blueprint for any errors; translation, where the ribosome reads the blueprint and gathers the required parts (amino acids); finally, protein folding, resembling the final assembly and fine-tuning of our car, ensuring each part fits together perfectly.	b620d0d37cd87fa00c150602b199bbf8	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's give it a lash! Think of protein synthesis as a pint being poured at an Irish pub. First off, the mRNA is like the barman who's been stuck in the cellar for donkey's years, finally getting permission to leave and enter the main pub area - that's our nucleus to cytoplasm journey.  Next, the mRNA links up with a ribosome; this is like the pint glass eagerly waiting under the tap. Then, the tRNA (the regulars) arrive with amino acids (the stout), each one matching up with a specific part of the mRNA (it'd all go arseways if they didn't!). Finally, these amino acids form a chain, just like a line of pints ready to be served; this is your protein. And sure if there's a mistake, the recycling system - or wise old barman - is there to take care of it and start again before any dodgy pucks are thrown.	50aff387c94e2d387bcc72f311cf4989	-1	-1
5	Well, looky here, mRNA leavin' the nucleus is just the start of a mighty long journey. It's sorta like hitchin' a ride on a riverboat - first off, it's gotta sail into the rough waters of translation in the ribosome. That's where this little boat picks up its crew - the amino acids brought in by tRNA, kinda like gatherin' a work gang for a barn raisin'. Then, these fellas get linked together in a process called peptide bond formation, which is about as intricate as lacework on a Southern belle's wedding dress. Finally, like a well-tied knot at the end of a long day's fishin', termination happens when the protein synthesis stops at a stop codon in the mRNA. Ain't nothin' simple 'bout it, but that's basically how our cells make proteins from them mRNAs.	e87592be8699c2f0e2f6ab69fc8b954c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA's journey from nucleus: Like a king leaving his castle with a message, the mRNA, carrying genetic info, leaves the nucleus.  2. Ribosome reading mRNA: The ribosome acts like a skilled craftsman, interpreting the genetic information carried by the mRNA. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: The tRNA is like a diligent builder, bringing building blocks (amino acids) to the construction site (ribosome). 4. Creation of protein chain: Finally, like a string of pearls, the amino acids link together to form a chain - this is the protein being synthesized.	37660dbe89683dc96c4ae4f8570b76b8	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA leaves nucleus like boat leaving harbor. Two, it enters cytoplasm, like boat reaching open sea. Three, ribosome reads mRNA like map, deciding where to go. Four, tRNA brings amino acids, like cargo for the journey - these build protein.	9475803e2831b9bc21eff85f6eb64f0b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Migration: It's like the mRNA, a coded blueprint, exits the safe vault of the nucleus, ready to start its mission. 2. Ribosome Engagement: The ribosome, acting like a workman's bench, clamps onto the mRNA to read its instructions. 3. tRNA Matching: Think of tRNA as tiny delivery trucks that bring the correct amino acids based on the mRNA code - it's all about supply and demand! 4. Peptide Bond Formation: This is like workers on an assembly line, where amino acids are linked by peptide bonds, building our protein product bit by bit!	0c26f54f35b540d2cd3e31999c09bcfc	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Just like a president's speech leaving the White House, mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic information. 2. Ribosome Reading: Like a chef reading a recipe, ribosomes read the mRNA sequence to make proteins. 3. tRNA Matching: Like a key fits into a lock, tRNA matches and carries the correct amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA sequence. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Like building blocks, amino acids join together in a chain to form a protein at the ribosome.	8c8c139e48e210104f33ec8cb9e60947	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, let's break this down like a corn sheller on the ol' farm. 1. mRNA gets to stepping out of the nucleus, kind of like a kid finally leavin’ home. 2. Then there's Translation where tRNA is carrying amino acids and matches them up with the mRNA, it's like matchin' socks on laundry day. 3. Next you got Peptide Bonds forming, which is when those amino acids link together tighter than bark on a tree. 4. Last step in this hoedown is Protein Folding, where that chain of amino acids folds up into a precise shape, kinda like origami. If the folds aren’t right, well, you're as useless as a screen door on a submarine.	77b935b17f67c85c279d83c7e9c075b2	-1	-1
5	Alright, here goes. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus like a dug with a bone, then it joins up wi' ribosomes in the cytoplasm - the two of 'em are as thick as thieves. Next, tRNA comes along, delivering amino acids just like a postie on his rounds. These get strung together to make a protein, building it up layer by layer like you're stackin' whisky barrels at a distillery. Last step now, once they've built what they need, the whole process comes to a stop, as still as a loch on a windless day.	fbd4e339687f5dbfddf4def1698ad59b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit like a recipe creation process! First, the mRNA exits the nucleus, much like getting your recipe card from the box. Second, it binds to the ribosome in the cytoplasm - just as you'd lay your card on the kitchen counter. Thirdly, tRNA molecules fetch and match amino acids to the mRNA's codons, akin to gathering ingredients. Lastly, these amino acids bond together to form polypeptide chains, similar to combining ingredients to form your desired dish.	685f8fa5e0caf91e1b8891e4a31fb88f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Export: This is like a diplomat carrying classified information from the country's headquarters (nucleus) to its embassy abroad (cytoplasm).  2. Ribosome Binding: Imagine the ribosome as a factory where the mRNA blueprint is read and understood. 3. Translation: This is akin to a skilled artisan (tRNA) interpreting the blueprint (mRNA) and accurately crafting each part (amino acids) of the project (protein). 4. Protein Folding: Like origami, the newly formed amino acid chain folds into a complex three-dimensional shape, creating a functional protein.	0efcec976f3461dc8014577295ffde5d	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Departure: Like a spy carrying vital information, mRNA leaves the nucleus with the genetic code for protein synthesis. 2. Ribosome Reading: In the cytoplasm, ribosomes act like tiny factories, 'reading' this coded message from mRNA. 3. tRNA Matching and Translation: Like a skilled interpreter, transfer RNA (tRNA) matches its anticodon to mRNA's codon and translates it into specific amino acids.  4. Polypeptide Formation: These amino acids are then strung together like beads on a string, creating a polypeptide chain which further folds into a functional protein.	279bd26d2bfd6a9886edb5e5ec4c831b	-1	-1
5	Sure! Protein synthesis is a lot like baking a cake. The mRNA is the recipe that leaves the kitchen (nucleus), then it's read by the ribosomes (the chefs), who gather the ingredients (amino acids) using tRNA (shopping list). Then, all these elements are combined in a specific order (polypeptide chain formation) to create the final product (protein).	ae1a783ef881f8041b27aa033ef1b44e	-1	-1
5	Awright, kiddo. Picture it like this: mRNA's kinda like ya favorite Sox player leavin' Fenway, headin’ out to the big leagues - that's it leavin' the nucleus, see? Then you got translation, which is like the player readin' the signs from the coach, in this case, ribosomes 'readin' the mRNA. Now we're into protein synthesis proper, where tRNA's bringin' in the right amino acids - just like a vendor brings hot dogs to hungry fans. Finally, these amino acids get strung together into a protein, just like all those plays in a game comin' together for a sweet Sox victory.	b255c44a43f505477121fbcfa2a385e9	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's kick off. Protein synthesis is a bit like a rugby match.  1. mRNA Exit: It's like the kick-off, where mRNA leaves the nucleus, heading towards the ribosome, it’s the start of our game. 2. Translation: This is when the tighthead prop, ribosome, runs with the ball, reading the mRNA sequence and translating it into amino acids, they're the tough guys making moves on the field.  3. tRNA Assist: Each amino acid is brought to the ribosome by a specific tRNA or scrum-half who passes accurately to his team players. 4. Polypeptide Formation: Lastly, we’ve got our try, these amino acids are strung together to form a polypeptide chain - that's your protein! Sort of like stringing together perfect passes to score a winning try. The crowd goes wild!	c2a7cced38c4cfee8798447cbb03a757	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? It's a journey much like a puck traveling down the ice in a hockey game. First off, mRNA leaves the nucleus, swift as a Calgary wind, carrying genetic information from DNA. This is much like when the puck is passed to a player from a teammate.  Then we get into translation, which has two parts: initiation and elongation. Think of initiation as the player lining up his shot, and elongation as the powerful strike that sends the puck sailing towards the goal. This is where the ribosome reads the mRNA's genetic info and tRNA brings in amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  Termination, that's when the protein synthesis process is complete, just like the sweet relief when that puck hits the back of the net for a beautiful goal! The ribosome reaches a 'stop' codon on the mRNA and does not bind an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Finally, there's post-translational modification where proteins may have bits added or removed, kind of like how players get traded or moved around in between seasons to make the team work better! It's a hot topic, as changeable as Maritime weather!	b8727a4ad9b58e2abef2a5cdb7696449	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis is just like baking a cake! Firstly, the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying the ""recipe"" for the protein (cake). Then, it heads to the ribosome (kitchen), where it's read by transfer RNA (the baker). This reads the recipe and brings in the correct amino acids (ingredients) in order to build the protein (bake the cake). Lastly, after all ingredients are connected in the correct sequence, we have a completed protein (a deliciously baked cake)!"	f020179207fb494c4e2e9e7195b92b4e	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here we gang. First up, yer mRNA scoots oot the nucleus, richt? This is like yer postie deliverin' a letter. Next, it links up wi' a ribosome - think o' this as like findin' the richt hoose tae deliver yer letter tae. Third, transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the code on the mRNA: this is like readin' the writin' on yer letter. Finally, amino acids are joined up tae make a protein, which is a bit like puttin' thegither a jigsaw puzzle frae aw the pieces in the letter.	b61940be43ab6e48a7fda729b28f57b6	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of mRNA: Imagine the mRNA as a courier carrying a secret coded message from the nucleus (the control center) to the ribosomes (the factories). This process is called transcription. 2. Decoding by Ribosome: Think of the ribosome as a skilled decoder, converting the code carried by the mRNA into an assembly order for protein production. This step is known as translation. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Consider tRNA as special delivery trucks bringing in specific building blocks (amino acids) according to the blueprint provided by mRNA. 4. Protein Assembly: Finally, imagine a complex 3D jigsaw puzzle being fitted together - this is how individual amino acids are joined to form a protein chain, creating a unique protein with a specific function.	ee1e25f75f919803b7f8e5b8f4a1beb8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a well-choreographed dance performance. It begins with mRNA, playing the role of the choreographer, exiting the nucleus which is analogous to a backstage, carrying the dance steps or genetic instructions. Then mRNA encounters the ribosome (the stage), where the dance or translation begins. Here, tRNA dancers interpret the mRNA's instructions, adding specific amino acids in a chain that forms the protein. Finally, once complete, this protein (the finished dance routine) folds into a specific shape necessary for its function, much like how each dance move contributes to the overall performance.	8c058c6f49be8473c6b288ae3efaac8b	-1	-1
5	"The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, much like a town crier carrying an important message to the townsfolk. The four major steps involved can be likened to key stages of a construction project: 1. **Transcription (Blueprint Creation)**: In the nucleus, DNA's instructions or ""blueprints"" are transcribed into a form that can leave the nucleus, this is mRNA, similar to an architect taking detailed plans from their office to the building site. 2. **mRNA Transportation (Blueprint Delivery)**: The newly formed mRNA moves from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, like delivering the architectural plans to builders waiting on site. 3. **Translation (Building Construction)**: At the ribosomes, the mRNA's sequence of codons is translated into a sequence of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), in much the same way as builders interpreting and following blueprints to lay bricks. 4. **Protein Folding (Final Touches)**: The linear chain of amino acids folds into a three-dimensional protein based on its sequence, just like a building structure takes its shape from the placement of bricks and application of final touches such as plastering and painting."	ffcab8153b4e200b848d3abc70ac5a7c	-1	-1
5	Well, let's start with our mRNA, just fresh out of the nucleus and wet as an otter's pocket. This lad travels to the ribosome, where it'll be read like a grocery list for a grand feast. Next up, tRNA steps in, carrying specific amino acids - they're the delivery lads with the goods for the feast. Lastly, these amino acids are strung together by the ribosome to form a protein, like beads on a string. It may seem quick, but this process has been fine-tuned over donkey's years and is as solid as the Rock of Cashel!	6f1f7e60d2efd3accf1bcca3e8568322	-1	-1
5	Well, sugah, let me break it down for ya. First off, that mRNA has gotta mosey on out from the nucleus and head on over to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum that's situated in the cytoplasm. Next thing you know, they start addin' on a brand new amino acid to that there tRNA. It's kinda like buildin' a house - one brick (or in this case, amino acid) at a time.	7ca6c830f198fdf67d15b96458408035	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, where it's read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA. This process continues to link amino acids until a STOP codon is read in the A site, marking the end of elongation and signifying termination.	f039cb0fd57c44309a7352f733b38a3e	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA Leaving Nucleus: The process of protein synthesis starts with messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting from the nucleus and traveling to the ribosome through the cytoplasm, or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Ribosome Transcription: At the ribosome, translation begins where the genetic code on the mRNA is read to synthesize the protein. 3. tRNA Translation: Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the codon sequence on the mRNA. 4. Protein Synthesis: Finally, as per the mRNA's instructions, corresponding amino acids brought by tRNA are bonded together to form a polypeptide chain, representing a protein molecule. This sequence continues until a full protein is synthesized.	8f06cfa94f94aaf29eaf8f16ebfc5aed	-1	-1
5	Once that mRNA makes its way out the nucleus, it hightails it to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or takes a detour to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, each tRNA molecule in the mix gets a fresh amino acid added on, like putting an extra log on the fire.	0388b28ccbea755ba462457a0f40f6f5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off wi' mRNA bailing oot the nucleus, then tRNA, tough as a lion, carries the complementary anticodon and recognises the similar codon on the mRNA. This process keeps going strong, high as a kite, until it gets a STOP signal fae a codon on the mRNA in the A site, effectively putting an end to the elongation and termination stages.	3fd6fccf804696badfe9ccbd0e52e758	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, which is then interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA.

5	In protein synthesis, messenger RNA (mRNA) exits the nucleus and is translated in codon triplets by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This initiates at the START codon positioned in the P site, leading to a sequential linkage of amino acids to form a protein molecule.	6fd062da4970226fdcd98c909a71ecf4	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA's gotta scoot outta the nucleus through this thing called a nuclear pore, right? Then, it kicks off this whole show called protein synthesis where amino acids get strung together, startin' with a codon in the P site - that's what they call initiation.	f9889c755a860c15867d31b33db4049d	-1	-1
5	As soon as the mRNA takes leave of the nucleus, it saunters through the cytoplasm like a tortoise on a slow week, until it finds its way to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, and quicker than a puff adder's pitiless strike, a new amino acid that corresponds perfectly to the tRNA is added, as light as a feather on a Highveld breeze.	f1910422437e0f71777dbea3cfe02713	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA departing from the nucleus like a Canuck pucking off at the start of a game, it takes a skate through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, akin to a puck gliding down an icy rink. Simultaneously, tRNA gets its roster updated as new corresponding amino acids are added, just like Maple Leafs constantly updating their line-up for optimum performance.	6d77af7ffdf68ba2b4e8430f73bfb417	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, migrating through the cytoplasm, and subsequently attaching itself to either a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with the establishment of an initiation complex at the START codon in the P site, facilitating the systematic linkage of amino acids to form a protein molecule.	bfe2492545a05b5a5094af0a67ed925b	-1	-1
5	Fae the moment the mRNA scuds oot the nucleus, protein synthesis kicks aff wi' initiation whaur the START codon in the P site sets the first amino acid. The chain o' amino acids keeps gettin' longer till a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signals nae mair need for elongation an' thus, concludes the process.	593dbf006afeef880a4cc065518d12de	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, commencing with mRNA exiting the nucleus, encompasses key steps: (1) Translation initiation, where mRNA attaches to the ribosome and the first codon is read; (2) Elongation process, during which each codon on the mRNA recruits a compatible tRNA carrying a specific amino acid and adds it to the growing peptide chain; (3) Termination, where elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signaling the release of the complete polypeptide chain.	72993f84c374138a4f018cf64fd92eec	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences post mRNA's egress from the nucleus, initiating with the translational phase where tRNA molecules acknowledge the complementary codons on the mRNA via their anticodons following the U=A, C+G rule. Progressively, amino acids coalesce forming a polypeptide chain that ceases to elongate upon encountering a STOP codon in the A site of mRNA, marking the terminal phase of protein synthesis.	5958a83b0d23caf5e21ddc4fbc99ac34	-1	-1
5	Following its exit from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, messenger RNA (mRNA) anchors itself onto a ribosome for the initial stage of translation. Subsequently, transfer RNA (tRNA) that bears a complementary codon to the mRNA sequence appropriates and appends a new corresponding amino acid, signalling the commencement of protein synthesis.	f9e8171f0550989337241dddace94cee	-1	-1
5	Starting off, our mRNA lad makes a quick dash from the nucleus using a nuclear pore, not unlike a fox on the run. Then, it's the rRNA's turn to step up to the plate, reading out the mRNA bases in groups of three, make no bones about it, these triplets are called codons and they're as rare as hen's teeth when it comes to their vital role in protein synthesis.	60f54173a951950714bd172bef68c43c	-1	-1
5	Alright now, first off, that there mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus and finds itself a ribosome to get the ball rollin'. Then, a tRNA with an anticodon, matchin' up to the mRNA's codon like sweet tea on a hot day, brings along an amino acid. This here process keeps goin', amino acid after amino acid, faster'n a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest until a STOP codon rears its head on that mRNA.

5	Protein synthesis involves the mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosomes where a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. This new amino acid on the tRNA then bonds with the adjacent ones, forming a polypeptide chain which later folds into a protein.	6e725cc3a5f8c0a471cdff003f2f8099	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, in a process known as initiation, protein production starts at the START codon in the P site where amino acids begin to link together.	578f200230bb3d0a821a2e790e0ff18a	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, bud! So first off, that mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus and makes a beeline for the ribosome in the cytoplasm or slips into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Then, in a process that's finer than frog hair split four ways, a brand spankin' new amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA.	7c7ce54958bdca2d351a21504b4bb7d6	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA scoots out the nucleus and heads towards the ribosome. The tRNA, with its complementary anticodon, spots the matching codon on the mRNA. Next, we see tRNA carrying a wee amino acid that matches up to it. Finally, as each new codon of mRNA is read, a corresponding amino acid is added tae the growing protein chain.	31873f26b5c4bc7ffdffd4d168ba38e9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and the initiation phase commences when a start codon aligns in the P site, thus beginning the formation of a protein by linking amino acids. Following this, the elongation phase occurs where a new amino acid is added to the growing chain via tRNA.	88016f98ae71cf64de05ab7ea6460ac9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and reaching the ribosome, initiating the translation phase where the mRNA code is read and a tRNA molecule with complementary anticodon binds to it. During this process, corresponding amino acids attached to each tRNA are added and connected to form a polypeptide chain, essentially constructing the protein.	cb7112453a22ab49f9cbe3faa16ac30f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when the mRNA, carrying genetic instructions from the nucleus, attaches to a ribosome in cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A protein chain then forms as amino acids are sequentially linked together, initiated by a START codon in the P site, transforming these genetic instructions into functional proteins.	3909491a9980501aa5f239bb26f33956	-1	-1
5	Upon leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA commences the protein synthesis process which is recognised by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon matching the mRNA's codon, guided by the principle of base pairing (U=A, C=G).	a16ec40b8b2671c91c5a1d9f15d6a6f7	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it heads for the ribosome, where each codon pairs with a complementary anticodon of tRNA, which carries the matching amino acid. These amino acids are then strung together in sequence until a STOP codon on the mRNA signals the termination of this protein chain assembly.	cb77b8e26e44da8dec9e3d697fca1566	-1	-1
5	As sure as the sun rises, mRNA makes its way from the nucleus through the cytoplasm until it reaches either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, like a taxi full in rush hour, amino acids keep linking up small-small until they hit a STOP sign - a codon on the mRNA in the A site - which tells them to stop this elongation and termination process.	328b9c5eedb4bfd37dbe03d6e5ae6af9	-1	-1
5	After mRNA is produced in the nucleus, it makes its exit through the nuclear pore to embark on a journey in the cytoplasm. It then either heads straight to a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, marking the beginning of protein synthesis.	e4135f9f73e945a1a36de8dd94821015	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs from the nucleus and is read by rRNA in the ribosome as triplets of bases known as codons. The process continues through elongation, where amino acids are chained together based on these codons, until a STOP codon is encountered, indicating the termination of protein synthesis.	56114823f0862fc5732ac5f96070f202	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks aff wi mRNA dashin oot the nucleus, whaur it's read in triplets cried codons by rRNA. Then, startin wi a START codon in the P site, amino acids are strung thegither tae mak a protein durin a process kent as initiation.	410b44cad7696a7eba0269622b7192da	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA moves into the cytoplasm where it either travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is the initial step in protein synthesis, setting the stage for subsequent processes like translation and translocation.	f0d07248663dacf2be3a09eec9d8f73a	-1	-1
5	Following the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis proceeds through four major steps: initiation, where the process begins at a START codon situated in the P site, linking amino acids together to commence protein creation; elongation, where new amino acids are continuously added and linked; translocation, which propels the ribosome along the mRNA; and termination, when a stop codon is reached and synthesis is ended.	50d44854508b512df83dc9fda11e47ee	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has been transcribed in the nucleus, it is exported through a nuclear pore to the cytoplasm. Here, during the processes of elongation and termination, amino acids are sequentially joined together based on the codons in the mRNA until a STOP codon is encountered.	6cb4bb9e1ef9a42c55994c6ad29a8d01	-1	-1
5	Well now, let's dive into this quare process! First off, our mRNA pal leaves the nucleus and heads for a ribosome where it's read three bases at a time. Then we've tRNA coming into play - like being as busy as a one-armed paperhanger, it matches the codon on the mRNA with its anti-codon and brings along a new corresponding amino acid to add to the growing protein chain. Next, these corresponding amino acids on tRNA are bonded together like they're as wet as an otter's pocket. If any of this goes arseways, it could muck up the whole protein synthesis process.	ffd3302be5dbf2c413055aab960949a8	-1	-1
5	Well, darlin', first things first, that mRNA's gotta traipse on outta the nucleus and hightail it through the cytoplasm 'til it gets to either the ribosome or heads on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, you got your tRNA, which carries this little thing called an anticodon that's just as cute as a button and knows how to recognize the codon of the mRNA that matches right up to it like peas in a pod - remember, U's for A and C pairs with G.	32587379604df42ae1940d6ff28c5e15	-1	-1
5	Starting with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis encompasses four crucial steps: initiation, where the initial codon on the mRNA establishes the amino acid sequence in the P site; elongation, during which this sequence is extended by continuously reading the mRNA and adding corresponding amino acids; translocation, where the ribosome moves along the mRNA to read next codon; and finally, termination, which occurs when a stop codon on the mRNA halts this process, thereby finalizing the protein structure.	d8df222c1cd0a000fc95b5432090d273	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis start when mRNA wey leave nucleus get read inna groups of three bases, dem call it codons, by rRNA. After dat, dem corresponding amino acids pon di other end of tRNA get bond up to di next tRNA's amino acids.	5caa3bd173f6810c3077a99c898dce33	-1	-1
5	Sure, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is transcription where the DNA's code is copied onto mRNA in the nucleus. This mRNA then migrates out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where translation occurs, which is the second step. During translation, ribosomes read the mRNA's code and tRNA molecules carrying corresponding anticodons recognize and bind to these codons on the mRNA. The third step is elongation, where the ribosome facilitates the bonding of these amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Finally, this process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered during termination, marking the end of protein synthesis and subsequently releasing the synthesized protein.	578481028fe87a23f133889fa1d96158	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs from nucleus: The process starts when mRNA exits the nucleus carrying genetic code from DNA. 2. Ribosome attachment: mRNA then attaches to a ribosome, which reads its genetic information. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings corresponding amino acids to the ribosome guided by the code on the mRNA. 4. Protein formation: These amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site, forming a protein, with each new corresponding amino acid added to the chain by tRNA until a stop codon is reached.	d356af2d49313a9b840878df7ef384c8	-1	-1
5	I tell ya, protein synthesis is a bit like building a house. First off, that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date, then it heads through the cytoplasm over to the ribosome or shimmies into the rough endoplasmic reticulum as smooth as butter. It's here in this step that we gotta translate the mRNA into amino acids, finer than frog hair split three ways. These amino acids match up with tRNA molecules and every time there's a match, a new amino acid gets added to the chain, building it up bit by bit. Up and at 'em until you got yourself a full protein.	854a7a8a3f00e80bb88a9b1d3175085d	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA gies a bunk up oot the nucleus, bringing wi' it the genetic code for the protein that needs to be built. Next, we hae the process of translation initiation where the mRNA binds tae the ribosome in the cytoplasm, guidin' the steps ahead. Following this, during elongation, each codon on the mRNA pulls in a matching tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid, sort of like how mony a mickle maks a muckle - it's all building up slowly but surely to form the final protein. Eventually, once a STOP codon crops up on the mRNA in the A site (it's as thin as a rake, so ye cannae miss it), that's when you know it's time for termination and the completed polypeptide chain is released. Lastly, if there's any changes needing made to the amino acid sequence or if a new corresponding amino acid needs added to the tRNA, then that would be done during post-translational modifications. So, ye see, it might sound like it's all mince at first but once ye break it doon, it's really quite simple!	ba4d0ae8f9dbc9f800a2d1c99fbd08ba	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus and migrates to the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum, moving through the cytoplasm. The process then progresses with the linking of amino acids to forge a protein, which initiates with a START codon situated in the P site, this phase is known as initiation.	0a9bc9553eadb29bf669a620f6dd2870	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves the process of translation which begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and attaching to a ribosome where the sequence is read in codons, each of which corresponds to an amino acid. The tRNA then brings in these amino acids, starting with a START codon at the P site for initiation, and they are linked together to form a protein chain, with each new amino acid being added to the chain.	aaeca41c18ceadaa5928c8eec5555bb0	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it initiates protein synthesis in the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome for translation. The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and tRNA molecules bring corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded together to form a polypeptide chain, creating the synthesized protein.	6c2c7696f3f697aa301b4d031f0f1796	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome, where it's read by tRNA carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon, thus initiating the process of translation. As amino acids are continually linked through peptide bonds during elongation, this ultimately culminates in termination when a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognised, thereby ending the production of the protein sequence.	ae216c4a393760ae871b8925169d7354	-1	-1
5	Alright, first off, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus. Next up, we got this thing called tRNA, right? It's sharp and catches the next matching codon on that mRNA, like findin' a perfect parkin' spot in the North End. Then, it hauls an amino acid over to add to the chain - keeps buildin' it stronger than a Southie dockworker! It's wicked smaht, ain't it?	946f603ee86322a19b0a8e120d918b9a	-1	-1
5	"Alright, my china. Here's how it works, starting when the mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus. Firstly, this ou jols around the cytoplasm to meet up with a ribosome - kind of like a shisa nyama where all the juicy stuff happens. Then we have these chinas called codons, which are just groups of three bases on the mRNA, and they get read by something called rRNA, like reading off a braai recipe. Now the kitchen gets hot! These codons call over tRNA molecules each schlepping a specific amino acid (think of it as your different types of meat for the braai). This is what we call ""translation"". The amino acids start to form a chain (like sosaties on your skewer), and this keeps going until it hits a STOP codon - that's when you know your protein (or sosatie) is ready. So from start to finish, it's all about taking things one step at a time, just like when you're planning a lekker braai with your mates."	b6e41d86e0909c5d46878ea3f8aed5d4	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four critical steps. First, there's transcription, where the DNA's informational code is copied into mRNA within the nucleus, a process as twisted as Toronto's streets. Then comes translation, which occurs in the ribosomes; it's here that mRNA is read and decoded into amino acids, a task swift as a Calgary wind. The third step sees tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) recognizing and binding to the mRNA's complementary codon, as steady as a Canuck's resolve. Lastly, this string of amino acids keeps growing until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read—a signal for elongation and termination, marking the end of protein synthesis.	f4ef71a9e62e1c38fa1d8c2d51f2d9e6	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, carrying encoded genetic information in the form of codons. The tRNA molecules, possessing anticodons complementary to those in mRNA (U pairs up with A and C pairs up with G), recognize these codons and bind the corresponding amino acids, which subsequently assemble into a sequence to form the protein.	9e2313c64a1fd10a7418a5ad1d616909	-1	-1
5	Guided by mRNA, the process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, finding its way through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or it may choose tae enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, as each codon is read on the mRNA, a matching tRNA molecule wi an attached amino acid comes alang and the corresponding new amino acid gets added, gradually building up the protein.	935068a039bd5e5ed03723f120133d0d	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying the genetic code in triplets known as codons, which are then interpreted by rRNA in the ribosome. This is followed by tRNA's role of bringing the corresponding amino acid for each codon, enabling a new protein to be built as each new amino acid is added to the growing chain.	b8aa55b78d005a8a36592e732e16b7a2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, an event which initiates the process. The mRNA then journeys through the cytoplasm to meet the ribosome, or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum where the next stages of protein synthesis - translation and post-translation modification - take place, leading to the formation of a complete protein molecule.	b681285eb932985860913f7086181b93	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to a ribosome, where the initiation process starts as a START codon locates the P site, signalling the start of protein creation by linking amino acids together. Subsequently, tRNA molecules carrying anticodons, which complement the codon of the mRNA according to Watson-Crick base pairing rules (U=A, C≡G), assist in recognising the mRNA sequence, effectively ensuring accurate protein assembly.	1350b744d2bad5cb9a66411f073adacd	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's not get this arseways now. Right off the bat, the mRNA steps out of the nucleus and onto the stage of the ribosome, where it meets its partner in crime, the tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon - it's as solid as the Rock of Cashel, this connection. Then we're bang on to the next bit: these two lovebirds dance along, with the tRNA's amino acids bonding with its neighbouring tRNA's amino acids, spinning into a protein synthesis jig.	4fa05312b8c097910311a7fd93fa66a9	-1	-1
5	Well now, sugar, picture this: That mRNA feller heads out the nucleus's door (they call it a nuclear pore, mind ya), and then them rRNA folks start reading the mRNA like it's Sunday sermon, in groups of three letters at a time. They have a fancy term for these trios, codons they call 'em.	4a6e5baae7a6767534f996c653782b24	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA departs the nucleus and binds to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, initiating protein synthesis.  2. Each codon on the mRNA matches with an anticodon on a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, which is carrying a specific amino acid. 3. This process continues as tRNA molecules recognize complementary codons on the mRNA strand, and each brings a unique amino acid. 4. These amino acids are then linked together in the sequence determined by the codons of the mRNA, to form a new protein.	a9939e30b1651659b6be79e3331cfd9c	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, after making its exit from the nucleus through what we call a nuclear pore, heads on to the next step. 2. Then, amino acids start to link up together to create a protein, and all this process commence with a START codon in what we refer to as the P site - that's what they call initiation, you know?	accd1d7187ff9fba19ec8b14e0c10a03	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moves to the ribosome where it's translated into a protein. The tRNA which carries an anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA, then amino acids continue to be linked in this manner until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, leading to the end of the process. This whole process involves four major steps: transcription, RNA processing, translation, and post-translational modifications. In each step, specific enzymes and factors are involved to ensure successful protein synthesis.	ff3ad0e4d5daf12b9df14cd8c2953569	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it encounters tRNA which carries the anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon - for instance, U pairs with A and C pairs with G.	2d47b6a7fb263012631e104479ba4d14	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's the lowdown. First off, that mRNA fella scoots on outta the nucleus and either visits a ribosome in the cytoplasm or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got these here amino acids. They get themselves all linked up to start makin' a protein, kicking things off with a START codon in what they call the P site - that's the initiation stage for ya.	bbab9d908ea778cb07a9bcaba3396504	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, a bit like leaving the hoose to go to the shops. From there, it's a series of steps - amino acids gettin' linked up like best pals at a ceilidh, going braw until a 'STOP' codon on the mRNA in the A site tells them it's time to head hame, wrapping up both elongation and termination.	4c55bf2ed257da66f5cc42d94976cb44	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with a START codon in the P site, signalling the linking together of amino acids (initiation phase). This process continues until a STOP codon, positioned on the mRNA in the A site, is read, indicating the end of protein elongation and marking the termination phase.	00b436ef74a270da4175bbd183ad42db	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a fascinating process that begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus. The journey starts when this messenger RNA (mRNA) carries coding sequences to the protein factory of the cell, the ribosomes. But how does this communication happen? It's done through a language of triplets called codons, each representing an amino acid or a stop signal for the synthesis process. These codons are recognized by another type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA), but how do they match? They use a complementary pairing system (U=A, C+G), much like a lock and key mechanism, where the tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon. Once this 'matchmaking' is successful, amino acids brought in by tRNAs are linked together to form a polypeptide chain, which is then folded into a specific shape to become a functional protein. Isn't it amazing how our cells carry out this intricate dance of molecular interaction so flawlessly?	adf89077609c25ab938da12a98e812bf	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm where its information is read in triplets of bases called codons by ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Isn't that fascinating? 2. Now, transfer RNA (tRNA) matches these codons with their corresponding amino acids - pretty precise, huh? 3. The amino acid on one end of the tRNA is then bonded to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acid, forming a chain - can you imagine how meticulous this process must be? 4. Lastly, once all codons are read and all the amino acids have been bonded together, the protein synthesis is complete producing a unique protein. Amazing, isn't it?	ae2c29b19c7041c04b5cf8a1d6f743aa	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having left the nucleus through a nuclear pore, is recognised by tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon. This matching process relies on the rules of base pairing, where U pairs with A, and C pairs with G, to ensure accurate translation and protein formation.	0b0c7dc7161fe469eb93756f94a16a8b	-1	-1
5	Alright, so here's how it goes down: the mRNA takes a jaunt through the cytoplasm, swinging by the ribosome or moseying into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, those amino acids keep getting strung together, quieter than a midnight in the Commons, until they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA over in the A site - that's when the party ends.	75d8d7fc55f20e6a4f04bcb79a30c05c	-1	-1
5	Sure, skat. Starting from the nucleus, where things are as busy as a taxi rank at rush hour, the mRNA, light as a feather, leaves the nucleus through something we call a nuclear pore. Then starts a process called translation where tRNA does its job - like adding more wood to a veld fire - it attaches new corresponding amino acids, one by one, building up the protein.	9f296783584cc941d1299f7920e94626	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, eh? Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus like a hockey puck shot from the blue line. The first major step is just as twisted as Toronto's streets, where the tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA - it's precise and steady as a Canuck's resolve. Then we have translation initiation, where the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA. Next up is just as swift as a Calgary wind, which is elongation, wherein amino acids are added one by one to build the growing protein chain. And finally, pulling up the rear, is termination where everything comes to a halt when a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. How about that for a cross-country journey at a molecular level?	c39d2264eed098bf2483c50f116e6fa1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a fascinating biological process, starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next remarkable step is the reading of mRNA bases in triplet sequences known as codons, an intricate task performed by rRNA. Isn't it interesting how these complex tasks lead to protein formation?	a44e76642061b4fe2607c430e1eb2fe4	-1	-1
5	Awrite, sae first off, efter the mRNA haes loupit oot o' the nucleus, it's read in clumps o' three bases kent as codons by somethin' cried rRNA. Then a matchin' amino acid is stappit ontae the tRNA – this is hou the protein gets biggit up, ye ken?	e7088b2d013c67723ba36a7a5deeae08	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or heading into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once it arrives, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads the mRNA bases in sets of three, also known as codons, which specify particular amino acids that are then assembled into proteins.	bd35b529d0acfb1cd81d50c16f78d284	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus, entering the cytoplasm where it meets the ribosome. Here's where things get exciting: The ribosome reads the START codon in the mRNA's P site, triggering the initiation phase—think of this like the green light at a race start. We now enter the elongation stage, where amino acids are continuously added, creating a chain. But how does it know when to stop? That's where the STOP codon comes in. Read by the ribosome at the A site, it signals the termination phase, effectively ending the race and completing our protein. So, in essence, protein synthesis is a meticulously orchestrated relay race within our cells.	49c743d080ad656557e7847414204efd	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, which then engages in translation - a process that starts with the initiation phase where a START codon is recognised and an amino acid is linked in the P site. Then, we have the elongation phase where tRNA molecules bring in corresponding amino acids, bonding them to the adjacent ones, resulting in the formation of a polypeptide chain. This sequence continues until a STOP codon is reached, marking the end of translation (termination), and ultimately leading to protein generation.	ed51a558394b37dab9751f1d1da2dbf2	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's not be in donkey's years about it. So first off, mRNA shimmies out of the nucleus and down to the ribosome, puck-starting the whole process. There, it bangs on about the genetic code, which guides how amino acids are arranged into a protein. This kicks off with a START codon right in the P site. Then, tRNA steps up to the plate, bridging the gap between mRNA and amino acid with its anticodon and amino acid respectively. The last piece of the puzzle is forming peptide bonds between neighbouring amino acids on tRNA - like linking arms in a good old-fashioned Irish jig!	7636052632d2f82e959cd489893dd899	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon it's as clear as a bell, y'all. The mRNA, bless its heart, skedaddles outta the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. Then that scrappy tRNA, carryin' what we call an anticodon -- which is like findin' a needle in a haystack, 'cause it matches up with the mRNA's codon just perfect -- it recognizes the mRNA's codon and latches on.	19eb77f31c6e0d9c8ca2828828515b7a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and is recognized by tRNA, which carries a complementary anticodon. This triggers the bonding of corresponding amino acids on one end of tRNA to the adjacent ones, resulting in protein formation.	688f2e8bb13189d9ea176a2867319674	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA exits the nucleus and start codon in the P site initiates protein synthesis by connecting amino acids. Following this, tRNA with complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) identifies the corresponding codon of the mRNA for continuation of the process.	52fdbea8dd29a705e22a4a51d2d0d94c	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, the protein synthesis process starts with transcription where information from DNA is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus. The mRNA then moves to the cytoplasm and attaches to ribosomes, initiating translation; this is the second step where the genetic code on mRNA is read by transfer RNA (tRNA) in a three-base sequence known as a codon. Thirdly, each codon matches with an anticodon present on tRNA which carries a particular amino acid. Finally, these corresponding amino acids bond together to form a polypeptide chain, creating a new protein while each tRNA gets a new corresponding amino acid added, continuing the process until a stop codon is reached.	b4a847abf652f118f034a35e337acfc1	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves nucleus, carries genetic code to ribosome. 2. Ribosome reads mRNA code in groups of 3 nucleotides called codons. 3. Each tRNA with matching anticodon (U=A, C+G) binds to corresponding mRNA codon, brings specific amino acid. 4. Amino acids from tRNAs bond together, form protein chain.	754a84b944cd498e3d8ee8250831c6d1	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, here's how it goes down. This mRNA fella heads out from the nucleus and gets read by rRNA in groups of three, which folks like us call codons. Then tRNA carrying its buddy anticodon comes along, matching up with the mRNA's codon like bread and butter!	1bb287dce8d9066da9ff4154abd71090	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, pure braw science that is! First off, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus then bumps intae a ribosome where its codons (groups ay three bases) get read by rRNA. Then up steps tRNA, bringing the right amino acid to attach to the growing protein chain, using its anticodon to match up with the mRNA's codon - it's like fitting a square peg in a square hole!	348c4e3adf2b92ba2a3cfd69ca1b3583	-1	-1
5	The journey begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, and moving on to the next phase which is translation. This takes place in the ribosome where each triplet of bases on the mRNA known as codons are read by the rRNA. tRNA molecules come into play next, boasting anticodons that complement those found on the mRNA, thus enabling them to recognize and bind to their respective mRNA codons. Lastly, these tRNAs carry specific amino acids which are then joined together in a polypeptide chain forming the final protein.	ab3cc167456db294de533c90ff28af4b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving into the cytoplasm towards a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process then initiates by aligning amino acids, starting with a START codon in the P site, to form a protein chain - this is the magic of life science!	ac43596391f54390c7616162316104ad	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA, which is a copy of the gene for the protein, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, making its grand exit onto the cellular stage. Once it's in the cytoplasm, the real show begins - ribosomes latch onto the mRNA and start reading from a START codon, signaling the beginning of the protein construction process. Here, in the ribosome's P site, individual amino acids are methodically linked together in a chain according to the sequence specified by the mRNA, thus commencing the incredible process of protein synthesis!	62136fb83f0c06714217242b670922ab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA exiting the nucleus, followed by the process of initiation where a START codon in the P site signals the beginning of assembling amino acids into a protein. Then comes the elongation phase wherein a matching amino acid is added to each tRNA, thereby progressively lengthening the protein chain.	bebb442750bccb25ece1f97e345ae904	-1	-1
5	Fuhst off, ya got the mRNA headin' outta the nucleus and kickin' off this protein makin' party, right? That's when the amino acids staht gettin' linked together like Sox fans on game day, all beginning with this hotshot called a START codon in the P site. Then, quickah than a car on the Pike, a new amino acid gets tossed into the mix with the tRNA. You're buildin' proteins fastah than a wicked nor'easter rips through Revere!	e9195c5e6e10340d8fd6deb340fb70e9	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here's a lekker explanation for you. First off, mRNA is as strong as a lion when it exits the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Then, veld fire fast, amino acids line up to make a protein, kicking off with a START codon in the P site - that's what we call initiation, chommie.	a19fe5a53b8a9a08611af31726d3c82d	-1	-1
5	Ok, let's dive right in! After the mRNA peels out of the nucleus, it makes a beeline for the ribosome or heads into the domain of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here where the process starts to get as precise and tight as a beaver's dam, with amino acids perpetually getting hitched until they encounter a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, wrapping up both elongation and termination stages. It's truly a sight to behold, as mesmerizing and complex as a stellar constellation on a clear Canadian night sky.	9b38c8a3517f6c3cbedc8482993b1d18	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA, carrying the genetic information, leaving the nucleus to attach itself to the ribosomes. The mRNA's bases are interpreted in triplets called codons by rRNA, where each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. Then, tRNA jumps in, carrying an anticodon that recognizes and attaches to its complementary codon on the mRNA. This process continues until a protein chain is formed, achieving the final goal of protein synthesis!	bf6ca9c0441e7d4abe2f2cc6b6c744b5	-1	-1
5	Richt efter the mRNA shoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's aff on a journey that doesnae stop until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site.

5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus, transporting a genetic code which initiates protein creation at the START codon in the P site by linking together amino acids. The process continues as each tRNA molecule fetches and attaches a new corresponding amino acid, thus further extending the protein chain.	0144ec950b72ca56203ca8ea64da3a2e	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: Inside the nucleus, the DNA's information is transcribed onto a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule which then exits the nucleus.  2. Translation Initiation: In the cytoplasm, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome where transfer RNA (tRNA) recognizes and binds to its complementary codon sequence on the mRNA. 3. Elongation: The tRNA carries corresponding amino acids that attach to the growing peptide chain as it moves along the mRNA strand. 4. Termination: Finally, once a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, translation halts and the synthesized protein is released.	f32a34940814cd6d0ae7901cf484b75f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA bolts from the nucleus and merrily waltzes into the cytoplasm, linking up with a ribosome where its bases are deciphered in triplets known as codons by rRNA. Then comes the exhilarating dance of elongation and termination, where amino acids are ceaselessly bound together until the STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, thus terminating this fantastic biological ballet!	784cb44c04d47e1d8aafe6b714e0ce59	-1	-1
5	Sure as God made little apples, the moment mRNA leaves the nucleus, it’s as fast as greased lightning to hit the first step in protein synthesis where tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon to the mRNA's, comes into play and recognizes its partner. Then, like hen's teeth, the corresponding amino acids at the end of each tRNA link up with their neighbours, on the never-never stopping this beautiful dance of life.	1781c0cc824456596243df2cf0ff134e	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin’. It's quite simple, really - it's a bit like findin’ a needle in a haystack but here goes. Our journey starts with mRNA skedaddlin' out through the nucleus door, that's what folks call the nuclear pore. Then we've got this clever little critter, tRNA, carryin' what you might call the opposite (U=A, C+G) anticodon and this fellah recognizes its match in that mRNA code. So you see, it's all about findin' the right partner at the barn dance!	2b650c41bcc653f7b9b1a3fc51204b38	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to arrive at either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Secondly, amino acids are continually linked in a process known as elongation until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, which signals termination of this protein synthesis process.	318fd80fac3eee8a78a06f63234294f4	-1	-1
5	One, mRNA come out from nucleus and it find the ribosome. Two, it's the ribosome that read the mRNA in set of three called codon. Three step now, tRNA wey hold the anticodon wey match the mRNA codon, come meet up with the mRNA pon ribosome. Four, tRNA drop off dem amino acid to form the protein.	2c0f74fe119c27a9477735b8c067a064	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA exits the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome where the process of translation begins. This is where the mRNA sequence is read and converted into a protein. 2. The mRNA strand is read in sections called codons, each consisting of three nucleotides that correspond to a specific amino acid.  3. Transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying an anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA codon, recognizes the corresponding mRNA codon and binds to it. The tRNA also carries the appropriate amino acid for that codon. 4. This process continues with tRNA molecules binding to the mRNA strand and adding their amino acids to the growing protein chain until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	c212bd215e1ad1bf218dec812150344b	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA, after leaving the nucleus, voyages through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or makes its entry into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. The process of linking amino acids goes on until a STOP codon is found on the mRNA in the A site, marking elongation and termination stages.	41663f306acee467cb8f3a688d1bc6db	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, that mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus and gets cozy with a ribosome. Now here's where it gets interesting: a tRNA molecule, carrying a complementary anticodon (like U to A, or C to G), recognizes its matching codon on that mRNA strand. It's like finding your partner at a square dance! Then, just as easy as adding another cob to the grill, a fresh amino acid is hitched onto that tRNA. These steps keep repeating until you've got yourself a brand new protein. It's like a well-oiled assembly line, I tell ya!	4c35d5625e4e83ad5960b814d7bc0f5e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a bit of a journey, starting off with mRNA scarpering from the nucleus and heading to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, it's a case of linking amino acids together until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, putting an end to the process.	bddde308f5b29e61c18c66adbb76c8cc	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and, during translation, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA. Subsequently, amino acids attached to each tRNA form peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids, creating a protein chain.	dcf9d374bfad611fdf5d5305be0ca077	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being read in triplets, referred to as codons, by rRNA. Following this, tRNA identifies and binds to the complementary codon of the mRNA, where each anticodon matches with its specific codon.	01e9e4777ab809503d9f93a5600f4fbf	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome for translation. During translation, tRNA molecules carry specific amino acids to the mRNA, where the anticodon of tRNA pairs with the codon of mRNA. This process continues, creating a chain of amino acids, until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, indicating the end of protein synthesis. Finally, these linked amino acids form a polypeptide chain which folds into a protein having its unique function.	79402738e24002150a315e82b88528f2	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA begins a crucial part in protein synthesis where it interacts with tRNA bearing the complementary anticodon, which recognises and binds to the mRNA's corresponding codon, effectively ensuring the accurate translation of genetic information.	d698d67a8ec35554c6cc2f9b28e698c7	-1	-1
5	"Alright, fella. So ya see, aftah the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, it heads ovah to the ribosome where it's read like a map to a Sox game. Then these tiny guys, tRNAs, they're smaller than a clam's hindquarters, bring in amino acids that match what's on the mRNA - they're put togethah densah than chowdah. This keeps goin', with new amino acids bein' added to the growin' chain till some stop sign (a STOP codon) on the mRNA says ""That's all, folks!"" So that's how you get from mRNA to protein, highah than Hancock Towah!"	46bdc6e0f0efe7df39992301a631d3f9	-1	-1
5	Ja no, it's easy, like adding 2 and 2. First off, that mRNA, just like a taxi leaving the rank, exits the nucleus and heads to the ribosome where its bases are read small-small in groups of three, yep, they call these groups codons. Then, just as slowly as a wet week, each codon gets matched with an amino acid on a tRNA - bit like a leopard finding its spots.	ecf6bd2ee58246365ee7db38fea44845	-1	-1
5	Absolutely, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, protein synthesis undergoes four key steps. First up, there's transcription where the DNA's information is rewritten as mRNA inside the nucleus. Then, just as steady as a Canuck's resolve, the mRNA migrates to the cell's cytoplasm. Next is translation which occurs in the ribosome - this is where that mRNA blueprint gets put to work, as changeable as Maritime weather. Amino acids are knit together to form a protein, as cold as a Yukon winter, starting at what we call a START codon in the P site, like the gun going off at a hockey game. This process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site - game over! This whole process of knitting amino acids and halting at the right time encompasses elongation and termination phases.	faf5f5f0ad3eb98a47b55857d89e5b6a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase, where a start codon in the P site signals the beginning of amino acids being linked together to form a protein. Following this, a tRNA carrying an anticodon that is complementary to mRNA's codon (U=A, C=G) recognizes and binds to the mRNA, marking the progression of the translation process.	9b54eb4ed8d1f00f3ce7c55ce8ef9c84	-1	-1
5	Aicht, sae first aff, efter mRNA bides the nucleus, the tRNA wi' its complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) recognises and matches up wi' the complementary codon o' the mRNA. Then a new matchin' amino acid is added tae the tRNA, makin' it a pivotal step in protein synthesis.	b380b3d78f823a24b9d28b630a30848f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA, carrying genetic codes, leaves the nucleus via the nuclear pore. The process then involves initiation where a START codon in the P site triggers the linking together of amino acids to form a protein.	0d27a3831d0a72d2b3d60bace2556889	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm, heading toward either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, its sequence of bases, grouped into triplets called codons, is interpreted by rRNA within the ribosome, guiding the accurate assembly of amino acids to form the protein.	cd07165da58ead943f3203b19eb1e5ec	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA being read in sets of three bases known as codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This is followed by tRNA receiving and adding a corresponding new amino acid, forming the foundation of the protein structure.	3e08b949ff9709e3342ab922a3b7eeab	-1	-1
5	As fast as greased lightning, mRNA exits the nucleus using the nuclear pore and then takes a ramble through the cytoplasm, heading straight for the ribosome or diving into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it's as solid as the Rock of Cashel, beginning the process of translating its message into a protein.	7490e8f9ef2f73d21a07bb8111d06269	-1	-1
5	Well now, when that there mRNA leaves the nucleus, the first big step in this protein makin' dance is initiation - that's when the amino acids start gettin' linked on up together startin' with what they call a START codon at the P site. Then we got us elongation and termination - which is just a fancy way of sayin' them amino acids keep on linkin' until they run into a STOP codon read on the mRNA in the A site. It's like a barn dance, but instead of dancers, you got amino acids, and instead of a band callin' out square dance steps, you got codons dictatin' the moves!	3ea9ea42e3cfbe2d5ca2588056fd1932	-1	-1
5	In the process of protein synthesis, mRNA departs from the nucleus and is read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. Following this, a corresponding amino acid gets added to the growing chain on the tRNA, marking another significant step in this process.	134c59d310d86da227682d9f749a17ab	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, or making of protein, tek four big steps after mRNA leave di nucleus. First step, mRNA bases get read in groups a three called codons by something name rRNA. Second step, dem add a new amino acid weh match up to the tRNA. Two more steps deh, but dem nuh mention inna di question ya.	5ffab7a5500b420f8b27ac539bab8ca8	-1	-1
5	The journey of mRNA from the nucleus involves its transit through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon, identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, a process guided by the pairing rules of Uracil with Adenine and Cytosine with Guanine.	61f41446a9f777705e558689b2a613f8	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves nucleus, it is attacked to ribosomes where protein synthesis begins, this step is known as Initiation - where the first amino acid links with START codon in the P site of the ribosome. 2. The next step is Elongation - the process where additional amino acids are added to the growing protein chain. 3. After that is Translocation - the ribosome moves one codon along the mRNA, releasing the empty tRNA molecule. 4. Finally, Termination happens when the ribosome reaches a STOP codon on the mRNA, releasing the completed protein. Each of these steps is guided by mRNA bases that are read in triplets, also known as codons, by rRNA.	89c4d0067ab169d81bc5b25ab1939e5b	-1	-1
5	Alright now, first off, that mRNA skedaddles out of the nucleus and moseys on over through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or it might just wander into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, those amino acids hitched to the tRNA get all cozy and bond together with the amino acids from the neighboring tRNA, tighter than bark on a tree.	0288d1a975560c535e2fa7e11df24cf1	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus, heads through the cytoplasm and parks itself at the ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, smoother than a pint of stout. Then, ye've got yer corresponding amino acids on the tRNA getting all chummy with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, bonding together tighter than a miser's purse strings.	645be54f57f860ea84067af6adaa5730	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA departs the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, or alternatively enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a pivotal process occurs whereby the corresponding amino acids located on one end of the tRNA form bonds with adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	2b32f964d952b9268e9e7497048d1962	-1	-1
5	During the process of protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus and links with a ribosome, where each codon corresponds with an anticodon on a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, ensuring the correct amino acids are bonded together. This sequence continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA, marking the end of the polypeptide chain formation.	3b8366c8f89d84657c121acfa2bd9803	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves crucial steps such as initiation, where an amino acid sequence begins to form at a START codon in the P site. This process of linking together amino acids results in the creation of proteins.	9c65cdbdd1dc3c0f52c3e17d124680e1	-1	-1
5	The migration of mRNA via a nuclear pore facilitates its removal from the nucleus, preceding a process in which its bases are read by rRNA in groups of three, termed 'codons', to initiate protein synthesis.	5351846f875f7fc8f66870d79068a5a4	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA skips outta the nucleus and runs into a ribosome where tRNA, bearin' the anticodon that's a dead ringer for the mRNA codon, plays matchmaker. Then, these amino acids on the tRNA, smaller than a clam's hindquarters, get bonded with their neighbors from adjacent tRNA - like a quiet midnight in the Commons, they become one solid chain of protein.	ba13e1559b91ef684a23624cf33a04bc	-1	-1
5	"Starting from that point when mRNA is vryer than the Karoo after it leaves the nucleus, first comes the ""decoding"" phase, where mRNA's information is interpreted by transfer RNA (tRNA). The tRNA gets a new buddy, an amino acid, which fits like a lekker boerie roll at a braai. Then, during the elongation phase, these amino acids are bonded together to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids faster than a veld fire spreads. These steps continue until we have a fully formed protein."	d14c4d5d7ec559a360a9b5899fae3d27	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates as mRNA departs the nucleus, a process as swift as a Calgary wind, then takes place in the ribosome where tRNA molecules bring corresponding amino acids. This sequence, bigger than a prairie sky, progresses with each amino acid being added until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read in the A site, ending the elongation phase and bringing about termination - as changeable as Maritime weather.	7b9a83fc7f3f704c5dbd9569f210d68f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA migrates from the nucleus to the ribosome or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The second step involves attaching amino acids together to form a protein chain, starting with a START codon located at the P site, referred to as 'initiation'.	fe7e938c0e77ad9a5cd5a09dd9b26e13	-1	-1
5	Furst aff, the mRNA gies oot the nucleus via thon nuclear pore. Syne, the tRNA, carryin' the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), clocks the complementary codon o' that mRNA. These are twa key steps in the big dance o' protein synthesis.	78a970d800b44f457af08153f3dc6a64	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis encompasses four critical stages. Firstly, it is transcribed into tRNA which then fetches and attaches a new corresponding amino acid. Subsequently, these connected amino acids on the opposite end of each tRNA form bonds with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain in the process. Lastly, this chain folds into a unique shape that characterizes the synthesized protein.	570b664bb219015f4417206298edb20b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving towards the ribosomes, where the tRNA carrying the anticodon, which complements the mRNA codon following the U=A, C+G rule, identifies it. Then a peptide bond is formed between adjacent amino acids carried by tRNA molecules, building up the protein structure.	99929e6a854291f5cb60acd3c7440e0e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA, having carried the genetic information, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore to travel to the ribosome situated in the cytoplasm or embedded in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This migration allows for translation to occur, where the ribosome decodes the mRNA sequence into a specific protein, which is then processed and folded into its functional shape before being transported to its required location, thereby completing the process of protein synthesis.	4609092b292c5084ea9bec0838864789	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, protein synthesis is as solid as the Rock of Cashel, but here's it down in four major steps. First off, the mRNA, important as hen's teeth, leaves the nucleus and enters either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, using codons, which are just triplets of mRNA bases, rRNA reads them like they've been doing it for donkey's years.	0ea9ba92e44ee5d6cae01e88859caa03	-1	-1
5	Well, ya'll see, that mRNA fella skips on out of the nucleus, takes a stroll through the cytoplasm, and hops a ride on over to the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like two peas in a pod, these amino acid buddies start linking up from the get-go at a START codon in that P site, starting the good ol' process of makin' themselves into a protein.	b6d58e6685c9289178fa4b051b0780e1	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA transport: After leaving the nucleus, mRNA moves into the cytoplasm and attaches itself to either a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Amino Acid Pairing: The appropriate amino acid is then paired and added to the tRNA structure, a critical step for protein formation.  3. Polypeptide Formation: Multiple amino acids connected by the tRNA form a chain, creating a polypeptide. 4. Protein Folding: This polypeptide chain folds into a particular shape that determines the function of the resulting protein.	62061addcd8d7bdcf6003a731f9ecb61	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leave nucleus through nuclear pore. Then, amino acids on tRNA side get linked to neighbor tRNA’s amino acids.	ae679a7141f4553b0dba22bff61527f8	-1	-1
5	1. The process of protein synthesis initiates when mRNA, carrying genetic code in the form of codons, each comprising three bases, exits the nucleus and reaches the ribosome, where it is interpreted by rRNA. 2. In the next significant step, tRNA molecules with complementary anticodons bind to the mRNA codons and place the correct amino acids they carry in sequence, which are then bonded together to create a growing polypeptide chain, essentially forming a protein.	ca6ac130cf1a9ba3b616ad2803303db2	-1	-1
5	1. Initiation: The protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves nucleus and meets a start codon in the P site, this is where amino acids begin to connect.  2. Elongation: tRNA carries the anticodon, which identifies the equivalent codon in mRNA, ensuring accurate assembly of amino acids to form the protein.	85eab8bc80c2252f489af0c8492b87d4	-1	-1
5	Well, you got that mRNA headin' right outta the nucleus and headin' off into the cytoplasm where it finds itself a ribosome or heads on into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then things get as busy as popcorn on a skillet with those mRNA bases being read in groups of three, what we call codons, by rRNA.	d784c40f5c24dcbc4ffc400b9d120d19	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA buggers off frae the nucleus and moseys on tae the ribosome. From there it's all a game of pairs, with the tRNA bringing in their pals, the amino acids that match up wi' the mRNA code. Once they've all had their wee meet up, the amino acids get friendly and bond together. The final bit's a piece of cake, as new amino acids join the party and get added to the tRNA. It's mince and tatties from there, but that's how you build a protein.	7b28c3eb92c995a61c74d39c35aea068	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the process of initiation where a START codon in the P site prompts the linking of amino acids to form a protein. As mRNA leaves the nucleus and reaches the ribosome, it uses tRNA to bond the corresponding amino acids together, forming chains that eventually create a protein.	babfae1204de16bfc46ed2f23288f6c9	-1	-1
5	In the process of protein synthesis, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules match their anticodons to mRNA codons, dragging along corresponding amino acids that bond with adjacent amino acids on other tRNA molecules. This chain of amino acids continues to grow until a stop codon is read from the mRNA, signaling the end of elongation and the termination of protein synthesis.	255c9ff2f9521662d324ef89a6f886a2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosomes where its bases are read in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Following this, tRNA links to these codons, bringing along corresponding amino acids which are then bonded to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, forming a protein.	31aeb7ff5f90eeddfef179aef0eec82a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA carrying the genetic code from the nucleus to the ribosomes, where it is read in clusters of three nucleotides called codons by rRNA. The process continues as tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid and an anticodon matching one on the mRNA, bind to their complementary codons, thereby laying down the sequence of amino acids for protein synthesis.	051af5c8e051dee720ffe0a220659ce6	-1	-1
5	Ah, you're talkin' 'bout the way our bodies churn out proteins, right? First, mRNA sneaks outta the nucleus faster than a Sox fan chasin' a foul ball. Then, them amino acids keep linkin' up stronger than a Southie dockworker until they hit the stop sign, just like when you're cruisin' down the Pike and see a red light.	e4359d9ff9931e440ebbbde5eb35dde6	-1	-1
5	Ag, protein synthesis, right? It's a process cold as a Jo'burg morning, which starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus, small-small moving into the cytoplasm and finding its way to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then quick-quick like a taxi in peak hour, a new matching amino acid is added to the tRNA – that’s basically the meat and potatoes of it.	9ec39391486bdd3abab8ec5fb480689f	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA, escaping the nucleus through a nuclear pore like a puck in a good old game of shinny, ventures into the cytoplasm. The protein formation journey continues with amino acids being strung together, tighter than a beaver's dam, during the elongation phase and doesn't stop until a codon on the mRNA in the A site signals 'game over', marking the termination stage.	1c07f84add1c5e809dce51f89d9879ca	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, which has the genetic instructions for protein assembly, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by tRNA carrying an anticodon, which recognizes and pairs with the complementary codon on the mRNA, ensuring the correct amino acid is added to the growing protein chain.	07599b4574c8d252d9cfc61202066bcc	-1	-1
5	Aye, efter mRNA buggers off frae the nucleus, protein synthesis begins wi' the initiation, where amino acids get linked up stairtin' wi' a START codon in the P site. As things gaun on, a new matchin' amino acid gets hitched tae the tRNA, buildin' up the protein we're efter.	a29b66a57294948e7aca150ccf5d13fc	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA departing from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves four major steps: 1. Transcription: This is the process where the DNA code in the nucleus is transcribed into mRNA. 2. mRNA Processing: After transcription, the mRNA undergoes processing such as capping and tailing before it leaves the nucleus. 3. Translation: This is where ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and link specific amino acids to form a protein, with transfer RNA (tRNA) playing a crucial part. 4. Protein folding and post-translational modifications: After translation, the protein undergoes folding and may also undergo additional modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation to achieve its active state. Lastly, a new corresponding amino acid is added to tRNA, ready to be used in another round of protein synthesis.	4a6467e3d63a3c9521ee95470948e5c2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, commencing with mRNA departing the nucleus, involves key steps such as: 1) mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and binds to the ribosome, initiating translation; 2) tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, identifies the corresponding mRNA codon; 3) The appropriate amino acid is attached to the tRNA; and 4) This process repeats, forming a polypeptide chain that eventually folds into a protein.	8ad79d5ae72c1c9dfc2286a336bf8876	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then a process called translation initiates where tRNA matches its anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. As this occurs, the amino acids carried by each tRNA molecule are joined together in a specific sequence, forming a polypeptide chain which ultimately folds into a protein.	78ddd08f7e14e533e4b569cc5b61971a	-1	-1
5	Like a donkey's years old matchmaker, the tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, spots and pairs up with the mRNA's complementary codon. This leads to its amino acids being as wet as an otter's pocket, bonding tightly with its neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids.	082df0eb95856cf4a52c86e57f03c6ad	-1	-1
5	Well, I reckon first off that mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus and hightails it through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or steps foot in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. And then, quicker'n a catfish on a hook, a spankin' new corresponding amino acid gets added onto that tRNA, like a fresh coat of paint on an old barn.	acda1024c7dadf591dd5aa0fde29b3f8	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through a nuclear pore.  2. It goes to a ribosome where it serves as a template for arranging amino acids into a specific protein sequence during translation process. 3. tRNA brings the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome based on the code from mRNA. 4. The amino acids attached to adjacent tRNA molecules bond together, forming a chain that eventually becomes a protein.	7f23db909a13f17d966f1acde1a5aeee	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis kicks off with initiation when mRNA, having exited the nucleus, provides a template starting with a START codon in the P site and amino acids are linked together to form a protein. Next is the fascinating phase where tRNA, carrying the anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon (U=A, C+G), identifies its counterpart in mRNA, truly illustrating an intricate dance of molecular recognition!	cd4462e7625cec663ca7703903ac392d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues as each tRNA molecule brings a new corresponding amino acid, allowing for the creation of proteins.	f3a8bec8f1b4906f4eff2279f2419a59	-1	-1
5	"Off like a herd of turtles, the mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, quicker than you can say ""codon"" three times, those mRNA bases are read in groups of three by the rRNA."	d65e63c92dc43d20cfd89ae92d112d1e	-1	-1
5	Right, so first off, mRNA goes on a bit of a trek from the nucleus, finding itself in the cytoplasm. Next, tRNA (which is round as a pease with its anticodon) gets all matchy-matchy with the mRNA's codon - it’s nae wind, nae wave. Now we’re onto the meat and potatoes, or should I say protein – amino acids start to chain up together, kicking off with a START codon in the P site. It’s mince to think how all these minute steps result in such an essential process!	a9e6bf394f99359756fe5d4e7e388993	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus, the mRNA voyages through the cytoplasm to find its destination, either at a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA molecules bring in corresponding amino acids which are subsequently bonded to the amino acids of adjacent tRNAs, forming a protein chain.	2c404ba980b99b6a6289a63111fbc259	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins with the exiting of mRNA from the nucleus and its subsequent linkage to a ribosome. Firstly, tRNA, carrying an anticodon that perfectly matches the codon on the mRNA, identifies and attaches itself to this complementary codon. This is followed by the initiation process where a START codon situated in the P site signals the beginning of protein construction, thereby aligning amino acids together. These steps mark significant milestones in the fascinating process of protein synthesis!	6aaf6e11f2b2a97ab13ccbcf9fc75c78	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA, carrying the genetic blueprint, departs from the nucleus and ventures into the cytoplasm where it may enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum or connect directly to a ribosome. Then, tRNA molecules carrying anticodons that are complementary to the codons on the mRNA (U pairs with A and C pairs with G) recognize and bind to these codon sequences, effectively setting the stage for the magic of protein synthesis!	a295c267f5ae6370093ead94372278f3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, bearing the code of triplets known as codons, embarks on a journey from the nucleus through the cytoplasm until it reaches its destination – the ribosome or potentially even the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here at these sites where rRNA reads the codons, thus setting in motion the magical process of protein assembly!	8ca4c12df4c44e04eac8012734d5f0e7	-1	-1
5	Awright, here's how it goes down, kid. First off, that mRNA hops outta the nucleus and gets read in triplets we call codons by a character named rRNA. Then some go-getter tRNA, haulin' the complementary anticodon, steps up and recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA. It's like a wicked complicated dance, but they got their steps down pat.	7e7aa47b3010e7de4f67896bf804876d	-1	-1
5	Sure, let me break this down for you like a hot veld fire spreads in the dry season. Firstly, you've got your mRNA waving cheerio to the nucleus and heading off to the ribosome - that's the start of our journey. Next thing is initiation - just like a leopard doesn't change its spots, every protein synthesis starts with a START codon in the P site. Then we move on to elongation where these triplets of bases called codons on the mRNA get read by rRNA, as high as the Drakensberg mountain range. These codons are like instructions for which amino acids must be added next. Finally, the amino acids are linked together to form a protein - voila!	044ec9e36f538fc4ffb262d0d90801eb	-1	-1
5	Ah, protein synthesis! It all starts once our pal mRNA leaves the nucleus like a puck in motion. First we've got initiation, where the mRNA hooks up with a ribosome and the first tRNA binds to the start codon on the mRNA. Then comes elongation, it's as busy as a Toronto subway station during rush hour, where each subsequent tRNA molecule latches onto its matching mRNA codon and adds its amino acid to the growing chain. This process keeps going on, bigger than a prairie sky, until the ribosome hits a stop codon on the mRNA. This is termination, where everything unclasps tighter than a beaver's dam and the newly synthesized protein is released. It's one beautiful cycle, eh?	ef9cb2c16da4530fc6a2b989c9785737	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosomes, where it serves as a guide for the sequence of amino acids to form a protein. The next step involves tRNA, which brings the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome and attaches them according to the mRNA code in a process called translation; this keeps happening until it encounters a STOP codon on mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	2fccf4fbf1e785e0659d82cb452d9fed	-1	-1
5	Weel, the haill process kicks aff wi mRNA leavin' the nucleus, richt. The first hailstane in the snawbaa's tae be a tRNA cairryin' a complementary anticodon that recognises the codon o' the mRNA - mind ye, it's a' aboot U=A an' C=G here. Then we hae the amino acids getting strung thegither tae make a protein, startin' wi a START codon in whit we caa the P site, that's yer initiation for ye!	e7da56cfa28da9d3e5d17e2721a51759	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA, carrying the genetic information from the nucleus, teams up with a ribosome to initiate a journey of translation. As the process unfolds, tRNA comes into play by identifying and binding to the complementary codon on the mRNA, trailing behind which is a series of amino acids that continues to get linked until a STOP codon signals the termination of elongation, marking the completion of protein synthesis!	ccdae97a504b209721c8dd803ede77bb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is a brilliant and precise process that begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus. First, mRNA teams up with a ribosome in the cytosol, serving as the blueprint for protein construction. Then comes the initiation phase where the very first tRNA molecule, carrying its specific amino acid, binds to the start codon of the mRNA. Each subsequent tRNA molecule, each carrying their unique amino acid and recognizing the complementary codon on the mRNA, adds its amino acid to the growing chain in a process known as elongation. The grand finale, termination, occurs when a stop codon on the mRNA is read, signalling all players that it's time to stop adding amino acids. This intricate dance leads to the creation of a complete protein!	f89046bbd03845e001383f19bd1a136d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, carrying the genetic code for the protein to be synthesised. The mRNA then attaches to a ribosome, where it's read in the sequence of three bases known as 'codons', each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid. A tRNA molecule, carrying a specific amino acid, binds to the matching codon on the mRNA strand at the ribosome in an intricate ballet of biochemical interactions. In a marvellous cascade effect, amino acids delivered by successive tRNA molecules are bonded together, instigated by the START codon, thus initiating a growing chain which eventually forms the complete protein - a testament to nature's incredible precision and design!	a6b01f9434a1a00510efa6e316e58acd	-1	-1
5	Alright, so we're off to the races with mRNA leaving the nucleus faster than greased lightning. Our first stop's the ribosome where, wouldn't you know it, a START codon on the P site kicks things off by telling us it's time to begin linking amino acids together like they've been best pals for donkey's years and that's how we start cobbling together our protein. Now, during this process, each amino acid has a buddy - tRNA - who gets an upgrade with a corresponding new amino acid added on the never never!	03800acac93d81498f827a09e0763556	-1	-1
5	Well, butter my biscuit, this process sure is a doozy. Startin' with that mRNA headin' out of the nucleus, it all kicks off like a hound dog on the hunt. First off, you got your transfer RNA (tRNA) carryin' amino acids over to the ribosome. It's like a potluck dinner - everybody brings somethin' to share.  Next up, you got these codons on the mRNA that match up with anti-codons on the tRNA - like two peas in a pod, they are. They're all hat and no cattle without each other, I tell ya.  Then we go on to initiation: that's when the START codon on the mRNA gets to matchin' up with the tRNA in what we call the P site. Now we're cookin' with gas! Last but not least, them corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA get bonded to each other - cute as a button, ain't it? They link together tighter than ticks on a coonhound to form a protein, which is the end goal here. So there ya have it - protein synthesis in four major steps!	b9bc103891889874708de5822797fb92	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying genetic information.  2. Translation: In the cytoplasm, rRNA reads the mRNA in sets of three bases known as codons.  3. tRNA Attachment: Each codon attracts a specific tRNA molecule carrying a corresponding amino acid. 4. Polypeptide Formation: The amino acids from each tRNA bond together, creating a protein chain.	ca2da281bd4a249b123ddf9f13380d5a	-1	-1
5	First step a protein synthesis be when mRNA lef' de nucleus tru de nuclear pore. Afta dat, amino acids keep joinin' till dem read STOP codon pon de mRNA inna de A site - we call dis elongation an' termination.	2a6458e3aa7e2b74358aaacfc38ac494	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, where it serves as a template for protein construction. The tRNA, carrying complementary anticodons (U=A, C=G), recognizes and pairs with the codons of the mRNA, facilitating the assembly of amino acids into a protein.	b480a3e12c2652bed93334cb2b666667	-1	-1
5	mRNA, after departing nucleus via a nuclear pore, traverses through the cytoplasm to reach either the rough endoplasmic reticulum or the ribosome. These steps are critically involved in protein synthesis process.	8b859a05376102799fdce478b23fe2ab	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's get down to brass tacks here. So when mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus, we get to protein synthesis which is like a four-part dance. First off, mRNA gets read by a ribosome - that’s initiation. Then we have elongation where tRNA brings in amino acids and matches 'em up with the mRNA. Once they're all lined up nice and proper, these amino acids get linked together, starting with a whatchamacallit...a START codon in the P site. Finally, this chain of amino acids keeps growin' until there’s a stop signal. Now each of these steps requires different molecules for support, but the end result? You got yourself a brand new protein.	6da7c8f7c2eab961e13d76246427c5eb	-1	-1
5	Okay, here's the script in Scottish slang: First off, the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, or it might even decide to nip into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a brand spanking new amino acid is chucked onto the tRNA - that's protein synthesis for you!	a602a98db2b97f03ca3773aff03a1f7f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being interpreted by rRNA in groups of three bases known as codons. Subsequently, tRNA carries corresponding amino acids to the mRNA, where each amino acid is bonded to its adjacent counterpart, forming a complex protein chain.	a7242920a8e90222249d7547532cb48d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving to the ribosome (rRNA) where it is read in sets of three bases known as codons. As this process continues, tRNA brings in the amino acids that match each codon and these amino acids are then bonded together to form a protein.	c9c4b4675ab9ea0825ddd0d08c66be6d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and binding to a ribosome, where it is read by transfer RNA (tRNA). In the process known as elongation, each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome based on the codon sequence of the mRNA; these amino acids bond together to form a protein chain. This continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is reached, signaling the termination of protein synthesis and releasing the newly formed protein.	657109b1d6b55e86910dfe3fffdc4da0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as the mRNA, carrying genetic instructions, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. These instructions dictate the initiation of protein construction in the P site with a START codon, involving the linkage of amino acids to form the resultant protein.	4438812288b27953b428fa6e55d8313a	-1	-1
5	Awright, first off, ya got the mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus, right? Now, four major plays in this protein synthesis game are: one, mRNA hits up a ribosome and waits for its first amino acid date - this is like the starting line at the Boston Marathon. Second, tRNA brings over amino acids and they pair up with the mRNA like Sox fans after a big win. Third, this love fest continues, adding more and more amino acids to the chain as they match up with their mRNA partners. Lastly, once that STOP signal shows up on the mRNA, like last call at your favorite North End bar, the protein is done building and it's time to ship out.	013a8a35ddd204a9219e71b305593c1d	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, mate! So, it all kicks off when our buddy mRNA says cheers to the nucleus and heads out through the nuclear pore, right? Now next up, you've got this ou tRNA carrying an anticodon that's a spitting image of the mRNA’s codon - like they're two peas in a pod. This is how the correct amino acid gets delivered at the right spot, sharp as a pencil.	0cfeedd26baeec2a36d83a1b938e249c	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis starts with mRNA departing the nucleus, heading into the cytoplasm like a determined Canuck. First, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, as steady as a beaver's dam construction; afterwards, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings up corresponding amino acids, each one fitting tight as a beaver's dam. At the ribosomes, these amino acids are linked to form a protein as swift as a Calgary wind. Finally, once the protein is fully synthesized, it's released to perform its crucial tasks within the cell.	2a9c39e71b2057589b6ace18bf075971	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with amino acids being assembled until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, signifying the end of elongation and prompting termination.	a61f3d3688b3e60e0c9c9fe4ef86e885	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA gies a wild trip frae the nucleus tae the ribosome or even intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, ye'll see that each amino acid attached tae the tRNA gets bonded wi' its neighbour, formin' a chain, makin' up the protein.	e282d732ec92e5a727aa93b03e93eea8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA migrating from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a new amino acid is matched and added to its corresponding tRNA.	0a3e602f65765d93d46ebc4650d08a1d	-1	-1
5	Beginning with messenger RNA (mRNA) departing the nucleus, protein synthesis, also known as translation, evolves through four key phases which include initiation, elongation, termination and post-translational modifications. During the initiation phase, mRNA binds to a ribosome and tRNA attaches to the start codon; in the elongation phase, additional tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids bind to the mRNA and create peptide bonds with the preceding amino acid; in termination, a stop codon on the mRNA leads to the halt of this elongation process; finally, during post-translational modifications, certain proteins undergo further alterations such as folding or chemical additions to become fully functional.	52433a2e84834759d8be1dd5e170f81a	-1	-1
5	Upon mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, a corresponding amino acid is incorporated onto the tRNA, representing a critical step in protein synthesis.	c52f91c4d2147d19550f6a8cae0f22d3	-1	-1
5	"Sure, let's take a walk down this path. First off, we have our mRNA leaving the nucleus, like a hare out of the gate. These mRNA bases are read in trios, or as we'd say, codons, by your man rRNA, quicker than you can say ""Bob's your uncle"". Then, the corresponding amino acids at the other end of the tRNA get bonded to their neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids. It's all as solid as the Rock of Cashel."	ea716ea64a7365594220c38e65615202	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! This dance starts when mRNA sashays out from the nucleus. First off, it hitches a ride with a ribosome, kind of like a trailer hitchin' to a truck. The second step's got tRNA steppin' in with its anticodon - that's just a fancy way of sayin', it matches up perfect as pie with the mRNA codon. Now hold your horses, 'cause here comes the third part: those corresponding amino acids on tRNA find their partners and link up tighter than a new pair of cowboy boots. And lastly, we got them bonded amino acids makin' themselves into a protein, which is about as useful as a pocket on a shirt! Now ain't that somethin'?	07941af77c7a233668b7125f5e36d9da	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: The process begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, carrying the genetic information needed for protein synthesis.  2. Translation: This mRNA then travels to the ribosome, where rRNA reads its bases in groups of three, known as codons. 3. tRNA Attachment: Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, which is carried over by tRNA molecules. 4. Protein Elongation: As each new amino acid is added by its corresponding tRNA molecule, the protein chain grows, leading to the formation of a complete protein.	2dfcaee3a92e8ec5041c24fbd291495e	-1	-1
5	Okay, after mRNA dey come out from nucleus, it start protein synthesis with four big steps. First off, mRNA go connect with ribosome and tRNA, then tRNA go bring amino acid wey match the mRNA codon. As the ribosome move along mRNA, new tRNA wey carry the next correct amino acid go enter. The amino acids now bond together for the other end of the tRNA; dis process go continue till di protein chain finish.	a0e944478f57fbe2811aeddffce601d5	-1	-1
5	1. The first step in protein synthesis is the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through a nuclear pore, a process referred to as transcription. 2. Then, in translation, the molecular machinery called ribosomes, composed of rRNA, reads the sequence of mRNA bases in groups of three known as codons. 3. Each codon signals for the addition of a specific amino acid to the growing protein chain. 4. The final step involves the completion and release of the synthesized protein when a stop codon is encountered, readying it for folding into its functional structure or for further modification and transport within the cell.	8477b2372ae5fa195bdbef518823dacb	-1	-1
5	1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) exiting the nucleus: Once the mRNA is processed, it leaves the nucleus of the cell and heads to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs. 2. Codon recognition: In the ribosome, transfer RNA (tRNA) reads the mRNA sequence in groups of three bases known as codons. 3. Peptide bond formation: This sequence of bases determines which amino acids are selected and linked together by peptide bonds, beginning with a START codon located in the P site - this stage is known as initiation. 4. Protein release: Finally, when a STOP codon is reached, the newly formed protein detaches from the ribosome and begins its function within the cell.	278c3bdb5b686b0ded875a981f26f8f2	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, here it goes - After the mRNA high tails it outta the nucleus through that nuclear pore, it moseys on over into the cytoplasm heading for the ribosome or makes its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's kind of like a mail carrier making his rounds, delivering the genetic information that'll be used in protein synthesis.	53790db1a088db65d806e0e27eb36202	-1	-1
5	Awrite, here's the doon-low. First off, mRNA skedaddles oot the nucleus like a dug with its tail on fire, gaun through this thing called a nuclear pore. Next up, the tRNA, carryin' the anticodon that's as complementary as your granny at a ceilidh (you know, U=A and C=G), gets wind of the matching codon on the mRNA.	09f45fa9771c7b9795e1698c886691c4	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus, the initial phase entails the initiation of protein synthesis, where amino acids begin to link together, instigated by a START codon in the P site. Following this, rRNA reads the bases of the mRNA in clusters of three, known as codons, providing the blueprint for protein construction.	1f416ee824631ccee1da35420004ea1d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, a mesmerizing dance of molecular interactions, commences with the exportation of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus towards the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Initiation, an early milestone, pivots upon a START codon in the P site, which kindles the assembly of amino acids into a protein chain; these amino acids, steadfastly bonded to transfer RNAs (tRNAs), form adjacent connections. The process then evolves into elongation where the protein chain extends by following the mRNA's sequence, and finally reaches termination when a STOP codon is identified, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	d978592b76fe80a7de781af821dfd2ac	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, protein synthesis encompasses four key steps. These include transcription where DNA's code is copied into mRNA, translation where mRNA is decoded to produce a specific protein sequence, tRNA charging where each tRNA molecule is linked to its corresponding amino acid, and elongation where each new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain by the ribosome.	9a0891c538ccb3b4f8ae30e469e6d0ae	-1	-1
5	"After mRNA departs from the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome, initiating protein synthesis. This process encompasses four main steps:  1. ""Transcription"": Within the nucleus, DNA's genetic instructions are transcribed onto mRNA. 2. ""Translation Initiation"": The mRNA then travels out of the nucleus and binds to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where its encoded message will be translated into a protein. 3. ""Elongation"": tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids recognize and bind to codons on the mRNA strand. The amino acid attached to one tRNA molecule forms a bond with the adjacent amino acid on another tRNA molecule, thereby gradually forming a polypeptide chain. 4. ""Termination"": This elongation continues until a stop codon is reached on the mRNA. At this point, the newly formed protein is released to perform its specific function within the cell. Each time a tRNA molecule recognises and binds to a codon on the mRNA, it carries with it a specific amino acid that corresponds to that codon. This amino acid is then added to the growing polypeptide chain in the process known as elongation."	6ddc1b09340625ea33de478397a6e229	-1	-1
5	"Fuhst, ya got the mRNA slippin' outta the nucleus and headin' down to the ribosome. Now, here's where it gets hotter than a T platform in August. The mRNA's read in triplets, right? These are called codons. Each one of them is matchin' up with a tRNA molecule carryin' a specific amino acid. It's like findin' your seat at Fenway, each one's got a designated spot. Finally, these amino acids get strung together faster than you can say ""Go Sox!"". They're bondin' together, creatin' a protein that's tougher than a Southie in January."	8079b95a8c91966a722facf04b13438a	-1	-1
5	Awe, protein synthesis is quite a journey, just like a trek across the Karoo. Starting off, our mRNA, fresh out of the nucleus and loaded with genetic instructions, steps into the bustling city of the cytoplasm where it links up with the ribosome (made up of rRNA). Here, it's read in triplets, which we call codons - lekker clever hey? Then enters the tRNA, as strong as a lion carrying an amino acid and a special anticodon that's the spitting image of the codon on our mRNA. All this fancy matching means that the correct amino acids are strung together to form a protein - light as a feather but essential for our bodies!	21ef2f58b57e3fdc8d66f8dba4a1d748	-1	-1
5	Starting off steady as a Canuck's resolve, mRNA, carrying genetic blueprints, exits the nucleus, and its bases, grouped in codons like a tight beaver's dam, are interpreted by rRNA. Then, larger than a prairie sky and until a STOP codon is read in the A site, amino acids are continuously linked together - forming a protein during the elongation and termination process.	89a312f2381fdad0963f507794ed41c1	-1	-1
5	Starting with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of elongation and termination then follows where amino acids continue to be linked together until a 'STOP' codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, signalling an end to protein synthesis.	2494b62cae921d87ba211075faa13478	-1	-1
5	Weel, first aff, the mRNA ups an leaves the nucleus, making a bee-line throoch the cytoplasm richt tae the ribosome or sometimes it heads intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next up, the tRNA, which is carrying the complementary anticodon (that's U=A, C+G), gets its een on the matching codon of the mRNA and knows it's found its pair.	3020e81d952bade38f30d4d0f682a0bb	-1	-1
5	In the beginning stages of protein synthesis, mRNA, carrying vital genetic codes from the nucleus, enters the cytoplasm where it is deciphered by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in triplets known as codons. Then, transfer RNA (tRNA) plays its crucial role by introducing a new, corresponding amino acid to the growing peptide chain - thus gradually building our desired protein molecule.	371385342faa16cf6a48f39208c2eaef	-1	-1
5	In the enthralling process of protein synthesis, initiated by the mRNA's voyage from the nucleus, an essential step is the attachment of a suitable amino acid to each tRNA molecule. As the drama unfolds, this addition is promptly followed by initiation, wherein amino acids are sequentially linked starting from a START codon in the P site, thus setting the stage for the grand emergence of a newly synthesized protein.	95ad002805e0787ddb489d68add38775	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA departs from the nucleus, subsequently undergoing translation to form polypeptides. This begins with the tRNA recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA in accordance to the pairing rule (U=A, C+G), followed by the addition of a corresponding new amino acid to the tRNA, culminating in the construction of a protein.	16c773b354ba3d77437a664694ebd6a4	-1	-1
5	Sure and begorrah, the process of protein synthesis is a bit like a relay race. Starting off, mRNA leaves the nucleus like greased lightning, heading for the ribosome, where it's read quicker than you can say 'donkey's years'. It then gets paired with tRNA, which is rare as hen's teeth, carrying a specific amino acid. This allows for the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA to be bonded together faster than a hare in March. Then, in a blink of an eye, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, setting us up for another lap around the track!	371034db793542a18dceb29b4d2a93eb	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, first off, our mRNA skips out of the nucleus and heads on over to the ribosome. Then, somethin' called tRNA, bless its heart, sees those mRNA codons and figures out they're a perfect match for its own anticodons - kinda like findin' your dance partner at a hoedown. Now, each of these tRNA critters is totin' an amino acid, and when they line up in order, it's as pretty as a string of pearls. Finally, these amino acids get all friendly-like and bond together, makin' themselves into a brand new protein. There ya have it - four steps to makin' proteins!	cf1a5309cc3352e7618acc0c6a638b7e	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA molecule, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. Once the mRNA reaches its destination, it initiates protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome, thereby setting the stage for translation. 3. This process continues with tRNA molecules bringing specific amino acids to the ribosome where they are linked together following the sequence dictated by the mRNA (elongation phase). 4. Finally, when a STOP codon appears on the mRNA in the A site of the ribosome, this signals the end of protein synthesis (termination), resulting in a newly formed protein.	4996fafc1ac9418cdb00cbe527d1a522	-1	-1
5	Okay, so first off, di mRNA does leave the nucleus and goes to di ribosome. Den, we get di tRNA wey go carry di match-match anticodon, ya know, like how U and A go together, and C and G. Dis tRNA go recognize di same-same codon from di mRNA. Next ting you know, a new amino acid wey match up with the tRNA is added. So dat's basically it - di process just keep going until all di protein is made.	96d0b0815b10d35543053a2b9830d346	-1	-1
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm and heads towards the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA presents its anticodon, which is complementary to the mRNA's codon, following the pairing rules of Uracil with Adenine and Cytosine with Guanine.	d8f90ec188b17ce9b21995df9b1a78da	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA departs the nucleus and journeys to the ribosome through the cytoplasm or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a corresponding amino acid is attached to the tRNA, which is a key step in building new proteins.	6275b62836f0b74885ee79e005ebba89	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! So first off, that mRNA has gotta skedaddle on outta the nucleus through a little door we call the nuclear pore. Now once it's out there, it's gonna start readin' them bases in groups of three - kinda like a triplet dance - called codons, and that's all thanks to rRNA doin' its job.	1d7f41f3e17caaaf6317f95cb4bc7c7e	-1	-1
5	Starting wi' the mRNA kickin' it out of the nucleus, it heads to a club called the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. In there, amino acids decide to have a ceilidh, starting with a lead dancer called START codon in the P site, and they all link arms to form a protein line (initiation).	4d0dc08ad0c66a229bd8431397d97384	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiated with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, subsequently travelling through the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once reaching the ribosome, the mRNA's coded information is interpreted in a process called translation, assembling corresponding amino acids into a specific protein sequence during elongation; finally, the completed protein is released during termination.	49ffcc731740e62957f0c58f7c411b55	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is subsequently interpreted in sets of three base sequences, known as codons, by rRNA. These codons are then translated into specific amino acids, forming the basis of the protein structure.	7e26f295a8b5028cbedc964986867a4b	-1	-1
5	1. The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus, carrying genetic information to the cytosol where the ribosomes reside.  2. The ribosome decodes this information in a process called Translation, which involves tRNA molecules that recognize and bind to complementary codons on the mRNA strand using their anticodons (U=A, C≈G).  3. This tRNA molecule carries corresponding amino acids, which are then linked together in the order dictated by the mRNA sequence.  4. This linkage starts at a specific START codon and continues until a STOP codon is reached, resulting in the formation of a protein.	154da85527c665d006a403f59681ab9f	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus, it journey through the cytoplasm to find a ribosome or finds its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by a second phase where amino acids are continually joined together until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted, marking the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis.	df9b4873488eaaa96097956a5793cd7e	-1	-1
5	"A'right, so first off, that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and lands in the ribosome where it gets read in groups of three, or ""codons"", by the rRNA.

5	Once the mRNA has left the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it kicks off the protein synthesis process. It all starts with a START codon in the P site where amino acids are linked together like a string of boerewors to form a protein - this phase is known as initiation.	9ef4442db498c820e436ab09493dface	-1	-1
5	Sure as a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey match is eventful, protein synthesis is an intricate process. It starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus, much like leaving the cozy confines of a prairie farmhouse. Now it's outside in the cytoplasm, it's as changeable as Maritime weather: It can get picked up by a ribosome for translation or it could get degraded. The next step is as solid as Canadian Shield rock - the tRNA, bringing along its anticodon that pairs up with mRNA's codon like two old friends at a Tim Horton's meet-up. Then there's the amino acid on the other end of that tRNA, chilling out like it's enduring a Yukon winter, until it gets bonded to another amino acid from an adjacent tRNA. Lastly, this chain of amino acids folds into its final protein form, just like how we Canadians bundle up when winter comes around.	f0cf50cfc67617b237b7d6ca06450a38	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Each tRNA molecule then adds a corresponding amino acid, building up a chain that will eventually form a protein.	f72e3545b709687a3f2234e26a1170f6	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA leaves the nucleus and mairches on tae th' ribosome for initiation. The tRNA, wi' its complementary anticodon, spots the matchin' codon o' the mRNA. This leads tae amino acids bein' linked thegither in a process we call elongation. This keeps gaun until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, which tells us it's time to finish up - that's whit we call termination.	1d7babb10bb59d35ca5e0ddd40740255	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is translation initiation, where ribosomes bind to the mRNA sequence. The second step is elongation, during which each new corresponding amino acid gets added to the growing polypeptide chain by tRNA. The third step is reading of the stop codon located on the mRNA in the A site which marks the termination of protein synthesis. Lastly, during the termination phase, the newly synthesized protein is released and the translation assembly disassembles.	0b1ff200e20717fc6da9f2ff30dc6cd5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA exiting the nucleus and moving towards the ribosome where the process of translation initiates by aligning a START codon in the P site, linking amino acids together to form a protein. The elongation phase continues as each new tRNA molecule, carrying a corresponding amino acid, binds to the mRNA at the A site and its amino acid is added to the growing chain, hence steadily expanding the protein sequence.	c0560631255b6e78b327b206c443b477	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and is read by a ribosome in a process called translation, which consists of initiation, elongation, and termination. During elongation, tRNA molecules pair with mRNA codons, bringing the required amino acids which are bonded together until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered during termination, ending the protein synthesis process.	37020ead338e035c3ab0f1661394b0d8	-1	-1
5	Sure, the process of protein synthesis is as fast as greased lightning, yet incredibly intricate. So, it kicks off with our mRNA slipping out of the nucleus and its bases getting read in groups of three - we call these codons - by the rRNA. Then before you know it, those corresponding amino acids hitched to the tRNA are bonding with their neighbours on adjacent tRNA’s. It's a complex dance that keeps us ticking over!	eee75883ea4d1490abcfbf91468f756b	-1	-1
5	Well, sugar, first off, that mRNA scoots right on outta the nucleus via a nuclear pore, quicker than a rabbit on a dog track. Then you've got your tRNA – sturdy as a mule and carryin' the complementary anticodon – it starts to recognize that mRNA's complementary codon, like two peas in a pod. They're workin' together tighter than ticks on a hound's back.	849cc61a5cef1c124cc7049829d9af13	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has exited the nucleus, the waltz of protein synthesis commences.

5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, initiating a sequence of four major steps. Firstly, the process of initiation takes place where a START codon in the P site kick-starts the assembly of amino acids into a protein.

5	1. Transcription: The first step in protein synthesis is transcription which takes place in the nucleus. During transcription, the information encoded in the DNA is transcribed or copied into mRNA (messenger RNA). 2. mRNA Exportation: After being transcribed, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. This is where it'll be translated into a sequence of amino acids to form a protein. 3. Translation: During translation, ribosomes read the sequence of codons (triplets of nucleotides) on the mRNA. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, so as each codon of the mRNA is read, a specific tRNA (transfer RNA) molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid is brought to the ribosome. 4. Polypeptide Formation: As more codons are read, more tRNA molecules carrying their specific amino acids are brought to the ribosome. These incoming amino acids bond with adjacent ones already present on previous tRNAs creating a growing chain of amino acids called a polypeptide, which will eventually become a protein. In this way, new corresponding amino acids are routinely added to the chain as per the sequence defined by mRNA until the full protein is synthesized.	b0a6aa9654837fbd2c4e6a95bbd6f91a	-1	-1

Now, it ain't as simple as all that, 'cuz this process involves readin' mRNA bases in groups of three, which we midwesterners like to call codons, done by rRNA.	2c1d9fedc9ce3e79d8010a894014b0ec	-1	-1
5	Firstly, mRNA bails out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, as swift as a haggis rolling down a hill. Following this, amino acids keep getting linked together, carrying on until they hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site- a process ken as elongation and termination, much like the end of a guid ceilidh tune.	707ccc19edc227a49ba99aa49454dc06	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves four key steps. These include transcription where DNA is transcribed into mRNA inside the nucleus, then mRNA carries this genetic information to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm; this mRNA is read by rRNA in triplets called codons during translation, each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid; tRNA then matches these codons with appropriate amino acids which are linked together to form a polypeptide chain, which later folds into a functional protein.	7531e0f3453517a1b869ccca06f9051c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus, involves these four major steps: 1. Transcription: In the cell's nucleus, a DNA strand is transcribed to form mRNA, which then exits the nucleus. 2. Initiation of Translation: The mRNA binds to a ribosome at its start codon (AUG), and the appropriate tRNA molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid (methionine) also attaches. 3. Elongation: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, it continues to facilitate the bonding of appropriate tRNAs with their specific codons on the mRNA, resulting in the formation of an elongating chain of amino acids. 4. Termination: This occurs when a stop codon is reached on the mRNA. The ribosome releases the newly formed polypeptide chain and disassembles, marking the end of protein synthesis. The completed protein then folds into its functional form and gets transported to where it is needed in the cell.	354b0b56f26dcf5d0fae034ae08c791d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being recognized by tRNA that carries a complementary anticodon. This then leads to the corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA bonding to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, effectively constructing the protein.	3ce1f8c5696e093a4998946bfcc93823	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore and then linking with a ribosome in the cytoplasm to begin the process known as translation. The ribosome travels along the mRNA, creating a chain of amino acids during elongation until it encounters a STOP codon, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	4dfa6ad449702b2926f09af90b98e399	-1	-1
5	A'right, so this whole protein synthesis thing, it's wicked intricate but I'll break it down fah ya. First off, the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore faster than a Sox pitcha's fastball, right? Then we got this thing called tRNA, smahta than a Harvard grad, carryin' the opposite (U=A, C+G) anticodon, and it recognizes the opposite codon of the mRNA like a Pats wide receiver snaggin' a pass from Brady.	3d62801368e58d4bf4bed31af1973d12	-1	-1
5	For sure, bru. After the mRNA says cheers to the nucleus, boet, it makes tracks through the nuclear pore, quick-quick. Then it's like a lekker braai, eh? The amino acids get together at the START codon in the P site and form a protein - that's initiation for you, nè.	735c17a7a2f6a51e0a11c45a494ef87d	-1	-1
5	Following mRNA's journey out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, four fundamental steps of protein synthesis ensue. Firstly, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where translation begins; secondly, t-RNA decodes each three-nucleotide codon on the mRNA, matching it with the appropriate amino acid; thirdly, these matched amino acids are linked together in a chain by peptide bonds forming a polypeptide; and lastly, as solid as the Canadian Shield, each new corresponding amino acid is added to extend the tRNA chain till a stop codon is reached, terminating the synthesis process and completing our protein molecule.	b139e4e28bf8eb665c031828d8b75473	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves four key stages, starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus. The first step is transcription, where the DNA code is transcribed into mRNA within the nucleus. After that, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm for translation, where tRNA molecules carrying complementary anticodons recognize and bind to the mRNA's codons. In the third stage, polypeptide chains are formed as amino acids are linked together based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. This process continues until a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, marking the termination of protein synthesis. The final step is protein folding, where the newly synthesized polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional structure to form a functional protein.	372b56cbb9f10e826b120bda9973c8a2	-1	-1
5	Aye, efter the mRNA scoots oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it sets aff a chain o' events for protein synthesis. This process hauds on until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, wi' amino acids continually being knitted together durin this elongation and termination phase.	e0479615809bfe7c5401ff27902169a8	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by the translation process where each codon on the mRNA matches with an anticodon on a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, and for each corresponding match, a new amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain, forming the protein.	b998d07d0867382a70cd0881f908448c	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it first associates with a ribosome, marking the beginning of translation or protein synthesis. Here, four major steps are involved:  1. **Initiation**: The mRNA, the first tRNA molecule, and the ribosomal subunits come together. The start codon AUG on the mRNA pairs with a tRNA molecule carrying Methionine in the P site, signaling the commencement of protein synthesis. 2. **Elongation**: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA strand, each subsequent codon is read and matched with its corresponding tRNA carrying a specific amino acid. This action results in the growth of the polypeptide chain. 3. **Translocation**: After the formation of a peptide bond between adjacent amino acids, the ribosome shifts one codon further along the mRNA strand. This process allows for the addition of new tRNAs and their respective amino acids. 4. **Termination**: Once a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) is encountered on the mRNA strand, protein synthesis halts, releasing both the completed protein and mRNA molecule. This step marks the end of protein production.	c5acc937d61514df420ebbb1c2ad5ab5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the process. This is followed by the linking of amino acids starting with a START codon situated in the P site to form a protein.	75ff2891f993944a96920aac1b36bfb4	-1	-1
5	As fast as greased lightning, the mRNA departs the nucleus and heads for the ribosome where, with a puck of its magic wand, it summons tRNA carrying matching amino acids. If any part of this process went arseways, the system ensures that these amino acids are stuck together in the right sequence to form a new protein, no messin' about.	1cc7e359b2eaa1b135415e8ba2da4675	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'! Alright, once that mRNA gets the heck outta the nucleus, it heads over to the ribosome and, quicker than a hot knife through butter, those codon triplets on the mRNA get read by rRNA. Now, don't you forget about our friend tRNA – he's carryin' this here complementary anticodon which fits just right with the mRNA codon, like a pig in the mud. It's up to the tRNA to bring along an amino acid and start building up that protein. Now ain't that sweeter than peach pie!	41af934db58ceabcc529333e26437087	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus: After being created from DNA in a process called transcription, messenger RNA (mRNA) exits the nucleus to carry the genetic information to the ribosomes. 2. Initiation: The protein synthesis begins when the ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon which matches the tRNA containing the first amino acid, forming an initiation complex. 3. Elongation: As the mRNA moves through the ribosome, a new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing chain by transfer RNA (tRNA) at each codon, expanding the polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: The process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of protein synthesis. At this point, the final protein is released and starts to fold into its functional form.	885fcbd1d430397fca0decf8ea8ce60d	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a START codon in the P site signals the linking of amino acids to form a protein. This process continues in the elongation and termination phases until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, ending the linking of amino acids.	38ba46f7cbc38f1b35db8228886379b7	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Translocation: After being processed, mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the cytoplasm.  2. Ribosome Assembly: mRNA binds with ribosomes, the site of protein synthesis. 3. Translation Initiation: The ribosome reads mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons; each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid.  4. Elongation & Termination: The ribosome continues to link amino acids brought by tRNA according to the codon sequence until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	1719f0212e890804dbc916a02e39faf3	-1	-1
5	Well, the first thing that happens is the mRNA gets itself up and at 'em out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then those amino acids start joining together faster than a jackrabbit on a date, kicking off with a START codon in what we call the P site – this process here's what we call initiation, it's the beginning of protein synthesis.	258853d56ba14dca0f3c71ac6b815d51	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA bails oot the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it gans for a wander through the cytoplasm until it hits the ribosome or dives intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's here where it kick-starts its job in protein synthesis, getting everything sorted for that next big step.	a9b1668f4cd0b6a0ca39b94be4675a19	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, containing genetic information, departing the nucleus to voyage through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During this process, the mRNA bases are deciphered in groups of three, known as codons, by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), paving way for the protein construction.	ce604b3bfd59d2719d174b0d22f22dd6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as the mRNA, a blueprint for protein production, leaves the nucleus and is read in triplets called codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA exiting the nucleus, leading to a series of steps that include elongation, where amino acids are continually linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognised. This process is followed by termination, which encompasses the bonding of corresponding amino acids at the ends of adjacent tRNAs.	9d066cd323fe7242864ec20c779a7331	-1	-1
5	Alright, first up, that mRNA scoots right outta the nucleus, cruises through your cytoplasm and lands either on the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, wicked important step here, those mRNA bases get read in groups of three - we call 'em codons - and that's done by good ol' rRNA.	c2e1efeaa7d978ec36734872b97ac1c2	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA gets the green light and exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it kicks off protein synthesis at the assembly line that is the ribosome. Here, amino acids are linked together in a sequence coded by the mRNA, starting with a START codon in the P site, just like when you're braaiing boerewors, you have to start at one end before you get to the other!	12ffc44de02e0d0422539d5f7cbfda80	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and meeting a ribosome, where a tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid binds to the START codon in the P site, kicking off the formation of the protein chain. As more tRNA molecules attach to subsequent codons, their corresponding amino acids bond together, building out the protein sequence like a beaver constructs a dam; it's precise work that results in something much bigger than itself.	11b476cecc592e3d822369014da8eb96	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA exits the nucleus and moves to the ribosomes where its codons, sequences of three bases, are read by rRNA. Then, tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid and the corresponding anticodon, recognize and bind to the complimentary codon in the mRNA sequence leading to the formation of a protein chain.	3f6b23d2012d4782335bbdc7a9ba91a4	-1	-1

5	Post mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it voyages through the cytoplasm and locates either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein synthesis process proceeds with the linkage of amino acids initiated by a START codon in the P site, thus building the protein.	ee61d0e0a9c2db0fafac0c208bb03c03	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, initiating the process by aligning a START codon in the P site to form an amino acid chain. This is followed by the recognition and pairing of the mRNA's codon by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon, based on the principle of base pairing (U=A, C+G).	041e7b72d2efd79addffc7c32a4971f3	-1	-1
5	Sure, the journey of mRNA out of the nucleus ignites the process of protein synthesis. It's been donkey's years since this complex process evolved, starting bang on with the initiation where a START codon in the P site calls up amino acids to link up and form a protein. Like hen's teeth, these mRNA bases are read as unique sequences in triplets called codons by rRNA, guiding the entire operation.	3929b0e8f8e8365254c481c245ff50be	-1	-1
5	"Well, I reckon the first thing that happens is that mRNA, havin' the important job of carryin' genetic info, makes its way on out of the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore. From there, it's like a train on the tracks - these lil' things called amino acids keep on joinin' together, one after the other, until they see a red light or what scientists call a ""STOP"" codon on that mRNA train route. This here process is known as elongation and termination."	4b6f2d26b60f4a9ab51a3616a5d50a26	-1	-1
5	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is recognized by a ribosome in the cytoplasm where translation begins in a process known as initiation. 2. Next, tRNA molecules which carry an anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA dock at the ribosome in a matching process. 3. Then, the amino acids that each tRNA molecule carries are linked together according to the sequence of codons on the mRNA, a step known as elongation. 4. Finally, when a stop codon on the mRNA is reached, the process of protein synthesis ends and the newly formed protein is released, this stage is called termination.	51e5d4a12514e4a71fb5706a0e6376fb	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis is when mRNA depart from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Afterwards, a tRNA that has a complementary anticodon to the codon on the mRNA is recognized. This tRNA brings along a new matching amino acid for add to the protein chain we a building. So, each time this happen, it like one-one cocoa fill basket - every step adding just a likkle bit more until we get a full protein.	0aa5e767ccff7ffbf19d25433a77b450	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, bringing along the genetic blueprint.

Ribosome attachment: The mRNA then binds to the ribosome, which is the site of protein synthesis, starting the 'translation' process. 3. Codon reading: Each triplet of bases in mRNA, known as a codon, is read by rRNA. This specifies which amino acid will be added next in the sequence. 4. Elongation and termination: Amino acids are continuously linked together to form a growing polypeptide chain, following the sequence of codons in mRNA. This process continues until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	c9a0178e9fb586328e3018029fa9d914	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, ya got your mRNA skedaddling on outta the nucleus startin' off this whole protein synthesis hootenanny. First things first, those amino acids gotta cozy up to a START codon in what we call the P site - that's your initiation right there. Then, wouldn't ya know it, a new amino acid gets hitched up with the tRNA, as fine-tuned as frog hair partin'. It's like herding cats, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be doing it faster than a tick's hiccup!	522136330a2bb8f4b549574a4f4de658	-1	-1
5	Well, first off, mRNA bails out of the nucleus, as fast as a weasel up a drainpipe. Then it gets to the ribosome - I mean, that's where all the magic happens like some mad ceilidh. It's there that tRNA comes along with its amino acid pal, adding each new one like building a tower of bricks. This keeps going until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read. It's just like when the pub landlord shouts 'Last orders!', and this whole dance stops dead in its tracks - that's your protein synthesis for ye!	c627e5029ac0b418d70450d104270f7e	-1	-1
5	Following the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, four key stages occur in protein synthesis. Firstly, mRNA is decoded by Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in codon triplets; secondly, Transfer RNA (tRNA) identifies and binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA strand using its anticodon; thirdly, the tRNA brings the corresponding amino acid for each codon; finally, these amino acids are linked together in a chain-like manner forming a protein.	4b13c5325d25b7e5b27251505bd934f0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying the genetic code to the ribosome where the process of translation occurs. Translation begins with initiation, where the START codon positions in the P site and links the first amino acid, then elongation continues this amino acid chain until termination, where a STOP codon on mRNA at the A site signals the end, thus creating a protein.	35a381b7e3401835b5103fb008734023	-1	-1
5	1. Transcription: The first exciting step emerges when mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying the genetic code derived from DNA.  2. Translation Initiation: This coded message hitches a ride to a ribosome where rRNA starts the decoding process by reading the message in groups of three bases called codons. 3. Elongation: As this intellectual journey continues, each codon signals the addition of a specific amino acid to a growing protein chain, almost like building blocks being stacked one on top of another. 4. Termination: The final act of this fantastic biological drama occurs when a STOP codon is read, signaling the end of the protein synthesis process and thus completing one of nature's most complex and intricate performances.	8d6935950b7bb2b6008f6de3aded1b93	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where each codon of the mRNA is read in sequence by tRNA (translation initiation). The process continues with a corresponding amino acid being added to the chain as each tRNA reads the next codon on the mRNA, forming a polypeptide chain (elongation), until ultimately a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered, signalling the termination of translation and resulting in the release of the newly formed protein.	b38b091fa5e99778a33230f46cf2574f	-1	-1

Fuhst off, you gotcha codons - they're groups of three bases on the mRNA, read by the rRNA like a wicked smaht kid at spelling bee. Aftah that, we move to the next part which is no slowah than molasses in January, I tell ya. Here's where amino acids get linked togethah one aftah anothah until they hit what we call a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. Once that happens, it's game ovah, and we end up with our protein.	017148194732fba02c60cb33012273b9	-1	-1
5	Just as quick-quick as a local taxi in the morning traffic, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus and goes for a joyride through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, like it's checking into a Sandton hotel.

5	Starting from the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves key steps such as translation initiation where the mRNA binds to a ribosome. The ribosome, equipped with rRNA, then reads the mRNA in sets of three bases known as codons to match each codon with its corresponding amino acid carried by tRNA, effectively adding that specific amino acid into the growing peptide chain. This process continues until a stop codon is encountered, marking the termination of protein synthesis and releasing the newly synthesized protein.	1c62037b322fcc5938d9904eae85993a	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus and finds a ribosome to initiate translation, an intricate process wherein tRNA, carrying its specific anticodon, identifies and pairs with the corresponding mRNA codon. This connection facilitates the bonding of amino acids at the opposite end of each tRNA, creating a chain that gradually evolves into a complete protein.	f3f37d5ebf8cfb5131ea6590c2af8787	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis is a magical process that unfolds in four main stages. Firstly, we have translation initiation where the mRNA binds to the ribosome. Next comes elongation, where tRNA carries the anticodon that pairs perfectly with mRNA's codon owing to their complementary nature (U=A, C+G). As a result, corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are irresistibly attracted to and bond with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids. The third stage is termination when this sequence ends at a stop codon. And finally, post-translational modifications occur where the synthesized protein undergoes various amendments to become active and functional. It's a fascinating cycle of natural engineering!	c4fa6b105770b54b80d370030df02479	-1	-1
5	Well, as quick as greased lightning, the puck-like mRNA scoots from the nucleus and jigs through the cytoplasm all the way to either the ribosome or checks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Well, the first thing happenin' after mRNA makes its way outta the nucleus is it gets read in groups of three, we call 'em codons, by rRNA. Then, tRNA, carryin' what we call an anticodon that's complementary to the mRNA's codon (think of U matching up with A, and C cozying up with G), comes into the picture and recognizes that there complementary codon of that mRNA. This is all just part of a bigger dance called protein synthesis.	cb928b7ae9b4681c407261edde3c7c3c	-1	-1

5	1. mRNA Exit and Ribosome Binding: mRNA, which contains the copied DNA information for protein synthesis, leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. 2. tRNA Matching (Initiation): Transfer RNA (tRNA) matches and attaches its anticodon to mRNA's codon on the ribosome, initiating the synthesis. 3. Elongation: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, allowing more tRNAs to bring their specific amino acids and attach them to the growing polypeptide chain. 4. Termination: This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signaling the end of protein synthesis where the new protein (chain of amino acids) is released.	8a9bad479f094424fc482c5a1a36a94c	-1	-1
5	Alrighty now, here's the rundown: First off, that mRNA high-tails it outta the nucleus and latches onto a ribosome. Then we got this character, tRNA, carryin' an anticodon that matches up just right with the mRNA's codon. Now, we're in business. We kick things off with a START codon in what we call the P site, and start stringin' together amino acids to whip up a protein. It's like a factory line - precise, organized, and gets the job done.	a9ca905f15c01de94729b388e8fadc04	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA takes a wee journey from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, stepping out into the cytoplasm. Then, like a determined Scot facing a grueling Highland Games, it doesn't stop until it hits a STOP codon in the A site, with amino acids being linked together in this process, building up the protein as steadily as a mason builds a wall.	65df2797e0a77335067744b7dcb01560	-1	-1
5	Following the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, it moves through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. At this stage, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises and aligns with the corresponding codon of the mRNA, a key step in protein synthesis.	e47b72fb6f2bdb528ee3f8b1caa98d19	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis involves mRNA, which carries the genetic code for protein assembly, exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore. As the process continues, transfer RNA (tRNA) attaches to new corresponding amino acids and assimilates them into the growing peptide chain according to the instructions carried by mRNA.	2c96333775d0d6d302f47c159148b082	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with initiation, where mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The process continues with the linking of amino acids, initiated by a START codon in the P site of the ribosome, forming a protein chain.	ad58c8b0fb2c1702dbe589f513d2f526	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiates the translation process at the ribosome. The process involves amino acids consistently being linked together, with elongation and termination occurring when a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted.	eb57bacaabb3b28f4801393b974bf598	-1	-1
5	Oh, ya gotcha bud. So here's the deal: mRNA scoots outta the nucleus faster than a car on the Pike, right? Then it makes tracks either to the ribosome or the rough endoploplasmic reticulum, smaller than a clam's hindquarters but mighty important. That’s when tRNA molecules carrying amino acids start hooking up with the mRNA at the ribosome, tougher and more precise than a Southie dockworker. They keep adding on these amino acids until they hit a STOP sign—er, codon—and bam, you got yourself a protein.	2a9f171b4678e50a04f752e8da44c9e0	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, boet! Kicking off with mRNA ducking out the nucleus, first up, it serves as a chinas to the ribosome where its bases are read in three's, those triplets we call codons. Then, like adding more wood to the braai, each codon calls for a new laaitie, an amino acid, to be added to the tRNA, steadily building the protein.	4f7af06fe776fb25e375a1a30afa258e	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is translation, where rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets termed codons. The corresponding amino acids on the other end of transfer RNA (tRNA) are then bonded together, forming a polypeptide chain, which eventually folds into a functional protein.	f3358b33d3582b6638e945c84525e866	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus, moving into the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by the initiation phase at the P site with a START codon, during which amino acids are bonded together to form a protein.	eaaba05ae95459e1535d3f8aa655e968	-1	-1
5	First off, efter mRNA leaves the nucleus, it latches onto a ribosome where the protein synthesis begins wi' a START codon in the P site - this is called initiation. From there, matchin' amino acids on tae tRNA are bonded together; this is kent as elongation and it's hoo proteins are formed.	29944e530853309069598ba234f765e2	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA Transport: The mRNA, carrying genetic information from DNA, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore to reach the cytoplasm. 2. Ribosome Binding: mRNA binds to a ribosome, the site of protein synthesis where translation, converting mRNA's codons into an amino acid sequence, occurs. 3. tRNA Recruitment: Each codon on the mRNA attracts a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid. 4. Peptide Chain Elongation: As each tRNA reads the mRNA codons, its respective amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain, building the protein sequentially.	b7887f16e3340fd371311e8c4d6fb230	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA departing from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is recognized by tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon, initiating a process known as translation. The series of codons on the mRNA dictate the order of amino acids linked by peptide bonds during elongation, which continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, marking the termination phase and completing protein synthesis.	d31e1508b94687f3cd01db5c771b236c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA leaving the nucleus, travelling to the ribosomes where its codons, groups of three bases, are read by rRNA. Subsequently, tRNA attaches to the corresponding codons, allowing adjacent amino acids on separate tRNAs to bond, thereby constituting the formation of a protein chain.	770646f579e6cd164a1d2ffb9f70f34d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, sure it's as fast as greased lightning - starting off with the mRNA making its way out of the nucleus. First, we have initiation where amino acids are linked together to make a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site. Then comes elongation and termination, where amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site. It's all as slick as an otter's pocket and done and dusted faster than you can puck a ball!	3a19ce27ac5a5e83ed94743c78d77e2d	-1	-1
5	Well now, sugar, first off, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle outta the nucleus, faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest. Once it's in the cytoplasm, it finds itself a ribosome to start this hoedown. That there ribosome reads the mRNA in bits called codons, about three bases at a time, like reading a recipe three ingredients at a time. Now these codons are like calls at a square dance - they tell the tRNA which amino acid to bring to the party (this is what we call translation). These amino acids get linked together in a chain, building up like folks joining hands for the Virginia Reel. This goes on till there's a STOP codon read from the mRNA - that's the ribosome's cue to end the dance and release that new protein into the wild. There ya have it - protein synthesis, Southern style!	8905394f6f71c795ec144dd20f6ee6a4	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome, sometimes even entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  2. Then, tRNA enters the scene carrying an anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA (where U pairs with A, and C pairs with G), recognizing and binding to it.  3. This process continues as the ribosome moves along the mRNA, creating a chain of amino acids. 4. Lastly, once the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, the protein synthesis ends, releasing the completed protein for use or further modification in the cell.	b63f69ad1c5eda5907a9510a6c85cbef	-1	-1
5	Alright, let's start with the journey of mRNA as it leaves the nucleus, yeah? First thing is initiation: this is when amino acids start linking together to make a protein, and all of that beginning with something we call a START codon in the P site. Now, these amino acids don’t stop there, oh no! They keep on linking until they read a STOP codon on the mRNA in what we call the A site, and this part of the process we name elongation and termination. So from start to finish, that's how we get our proteins synthesized.	44a947a09f8a3ad098c8e203c7c8f4c2	-1	-1
5	The first step in protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling to the ribosomes, where its bases are read in sets of three, also known as codons, by rRNA. The process continues with amino acids being assembled and continually linked until reaching a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, signifying the end of elongation and triggering termination of protein synthesis.	b27254e2a7bc52daed680e6168955fc6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, amino acids start to link together into a protein at the START codon in the P site through a process called initiation.	69913f523c51de1be662a65e7efd28cb	-1	-1
5	Well, you betcha, this starts with that mRNA scootin' out of the nucleus. Then, it's up and at 'em, as this mRNA gets read in triplets, sorta like codons. Next thing ya know, amino acids start linkin' faster than a jackrabbit on a date until they bump into a STOP sign on that mRNA. Lastly, that process of elongation and termination wraps up things tighter than twine on a hay bale.	40303ab322cc1a163ed43cdfa66644fc	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA buggers off fae the nucleus and makes its way through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or it decides to enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, these amino acids keep getting stitched together until a STOP codon gets read on the mRNA in the A site, bringing an end to this elongation and termination process.	3526a0fef3750b102f1a0e2e5b0020e1	-1	-1
5	1. The first step starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and makes its way to the cytoplasm where it binds to a ribosome, setting the stage for protein synthesis. 2. The second step is initiation, where the ribosome scans the mRNA until it reaches an 'initiator' codon, marking the start of protein production.  3. Then we have elongation, in which transfer RNAs (tRNAs), having corresponding amino acids on their other end, recognise and bind to the codons on the mRNA. As each new tRNA binds to its corresponding mRNA codon, its amino acid bonds with the previous tRNA’s amino acid.  4. Lastly, there's termination where this process goes on until a 'stop' codon is encountered on the mRNA, signalling that the final protein has been synthesised and can now be released from the ribosome for further processing within the cell.	0b06793ac164d979dc22bd2b5857d1b5	-1	-1
5	1. The journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA bids farewell to the nucleus, slipping out through a nuclear pore like a secret messenger in the night.  2. This mRNA then embarks on a voyage through the cytoplasm, navigating towards the ribosome or seeking refuge within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, both of which serve as critical sites for the next phase of protein synthesis. 3. Here at these sites, the process of translation occurs: tRNA molecules, each carrying an amino acid and an anticodon matching the codon on the mRNA, bind to the mRNA sequence. 4. Through this intricate dance of molecular matchmaking, the amino acids are linked together in a chain, following the order dictated by the mRNA sequence and forming a polypeptide chain that will fold into a functional protein.	331c711bd71a1867a1192ac4513b28b1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling to the ribosomes where the process of translation takes place. The first major step is Initiation, in which the start codon on the mRNA attaches to the tRNA in the P site of the ribosome. This is followed by Elongation, where a new corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain. Termination occurs when the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, thus ending the synthesis. Lastly, in Post-Translation Modification, the newly synthesized protein undergoes various modifications before it becomes fully functional.	19d2fb77012d493bdb2897428ffe3e9e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, having exited the nucleus through a nuclear pore, travels to the ribosome where it serves as the template for the assembly of amino acids, facilitated by tRNA molecules. The process culminates in a polypeptide chain being formed due to adjacent tRNA molecules' corresponding amino acids successfully bonding together.	4d7851b1fc0db08938092e64c843b1a1	-1	-1
5	Alright, first things first, that mRNA's gotta duck outta the nucleus and hit up a ribosome; think of it like a Sox fan hustlin' to Fenway. Once it settles in there, we get to the real action: translation. It's a bit like a meet-and-greet at Quincy Market - each tRNA, bearin' a fancy anticodon tag, pairs up with its matching mRNA codon. Now here's the magic part, each tRNA also brought along an amino acid - kinda like everyone bringin' their own Sam Adams to the party. As they line up in the right order - thanks to their anticodon tags - those amino acids bond together, tighter than a wicked Boston traffic jam. This string of bonded amino acids is what we call a protein, kid. So there ya have it: mRNA leaves the nucleus, finds a ribosome, hooks up with the right tRNAs and their amino acids, and voila! You got yourself a protein. It’s science, but it’s beautiful, ain’t it?	45fca222f40b503b2436dc953a89cc34	-1	-1
5	"First off, the mRNA scoots out of the nucleus via a nuclear pore just like a Jo'burg taxi in rush hour traffic. Now, this is where it gets interesting, in a ""leopard doesn't change its spots"" kind of way - the mRNA kicks off the whole shebang by linking amino acids together to make a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site, or what we can call 'the initiation' phase, which is the beginning of small-small steps towards our final protein product."	f88659d59f3ba6d7b6ac160934357462	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Starting off this journey, the mRNA, fresher than a Maritime morning, scoots out from the nucleus. It meets its dance partner, the tRNA, which carries complimentary anticodons that are as perfectly matched as hockey and a cold Canadian winter. Together, they do the two-step tango adding a brand new amino acid to the tRNA with each step, creating a protein chain bigger than a prairie sky. This whole process is as intricate and changeable as weather in the Maritimes, but it's all part of the fascinating waltz of protein synthesis.	84d84110ae035e631d891ddfaaed3d6c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA's grand departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, embarking on a journey through the cytoplasm until it locates a ribosome, or stepping into the rough and bustling world of the endoplasmic reticulum. This dynamic voyage is followed by three major phases: namely, initiation where the mRNA, ribosome and initiator tRNA unite to form a complex; elongation where amino acids are added one by one to the growing polypeptide chain; and finally termination, when a stop codon signals the end of the protein synthesis process.	8eb5d4e647cdbaaef6a626f54935dc71	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA buggers aff fae the nucleus an trots through the cytoplasm tae meet up wi' the ribosome or it micht dive intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, the amino acids keep on linkin' thegither until a STOP codon is read oan the mRNA in the A site, an' that's when we hae elongation an termination.	3854ff66b26fd456d747bc52e7d6dbb3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and heading to the ribosome where it provides the template for arranging amino acids through a process called initiation, starting with a START codon in the P site. tRNA then carries corresponding amino acids which are bonded together to form a protein chain as per the sequence specified by the mRNA, a stage known as elongation.	ccc3272cc641bff8a752b3c5df36b335	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs from the nucleus, carrying the genetic code in triplets known as codons which are then interpreted by rRNA. This process leads to the stringing of amino acids until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site signaling both the elongation and termination phases of this molecular dance.	f4cbaadef4677636270bb93734f312d2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by each tRNA molecule having a new corresponding amino acid added, enabling the construction of the protein.	2412c74b2b9a0e5d0ae3560b6b97caaa	-1	-1
5	Sure, starting off with the mRNA, it puck out of the nucleus and journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or takes the scenic route into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, as solid as the Rock of Cashel, the corresponding amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA bond together, adjacent to the tRNA’s amino acids, like a community on the never never sticking together.	9932b90b12f59b9c1b8cb42e67fcc17d	-1	-1
5	Well, after that there mRNA fella skedaddles outta the nucleus, he's gotta do a few things for protein synthesis. First off, he hitches a ride on this ribosome thingamajig that reads his message and finds a matchin' tRNA molecule with an amino acid. It's sorta like findin' your dance partner at a hoedown. Then, this process keeps repeatin' till an end signal or 'STOP codon' comes up. It's slower than molasses in January but that's how you get your proteins made, y'all.	6b9216d1bc505c1315a2816892fcdd5e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA escapes nucleus through a nuclear pore. 2. Ribosome reads mRNA's codons. 3. tRNA matches anticodons with mRNA's codons. 4. Amino acids, from each tRNA's other end, bond together.	57cf6a9938bf86d6b5fa1d68499b1cae	-1	-1
5	First, with the START codon in the P site, amino acids start linking up for make protein (dat call initiation). Then, the mRNA bases, dem read in groups of three, we call it codons, and that reading done by rRNA.	31df15b86fd180a9e5c7379f46cf5bf9	-1	-1
5	The mRNA, having exited the nucleus, journeys through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA, which bears the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), identifies and pairs with the matching codon on the mRNA.	df090ba3ac4dcd2089d2be0283637f0d	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exits nucleus, reaches cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Ribosome reads mRNA start codon at P site, tRNA brings corresponding amino acid. 3. Another tRNA with amino acid attaches at A site, peptide bond forms between acids (elongation). 4. Process repeats until STOP codon on mRNA at A site, then protein synthesis ends (termination).	0c7d0a5ddd6ae7e3304ef2421f29dc39	-1	-1
5	Well shoot, this is a bit like makin' cornbread from scratch, ain't it? So, first off, that mRNA skips outta the nucleus faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Now it's gotta go through a process we call translation. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule like you'd read a recipe for grandma's apple pie.  Now, pay attention cause here's where it gets finer than frog hair split four ways: each codon (or three-base sequence) on the mRNA matches up with something called tRNA that's got a specific amino acid attached. It's like findin' the right tool in your toolbox - each tool has its own job.  Once they're matched up tighter than bark on a tree, the ribosome helps bond those amino acids together. Think of it like joinin' hands at Sunday service - all connected in one long chain to make a protein.  Lastly, once that protein chain is done, it goes off to get folded into the right shape. Kinda like foldin' laundry, only much more complicated! If it ain't folded right, it ain't gonna work proper. That there in a nutshell’s how proteins are made.	17fcc310c6316abb4db564bf6c2b42db	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, carrying genetic information, departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This mRNA then guides tRNA in aligning the corresponding amino acids which undergo bonding to form a protein at the ribosome.	3f17a0589c5a2eb2488d806a9483246c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA exits the nucleus and is read in triplets, known as codons, by rRNA in the ribosomes. During a process called translation, each codon on the mRNA matches up with an anticodon on a tRNA molecule carrying a specific amino acid, gradually extending the protein chain as every new amino acid is added.	f3da0e523afdad222b31f459ecce4183	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, which rRNA then reads in triplets known as codons. Following this, tRNA carrying the matching anticodon recognises and binds to the mRNA's complementary codon, essentially decoding the mRNA's information to build a protein sequence.	437f14b93d349237c58f79a006e6ae8b	-1	-1
5	Aight, so the tRNA's like a decoder ring, matchin' up codons on the mRNA. Then, they keep slappin' together amino acids till a STOP codon shows up, faster than a car on the Pike.	8f9be88707a592b51011578f44437f72	-1	-1
5	Okay, so first up, our mRNA takes a gap from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, right? Then, as quick as a hadeda at dawn, a fresh matching amino acid gets added to the tRNA. Eish, bio is deep hey?	52e9aa0beaeaa8fc6e82af75a5b5772d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? It kicks off as swift as a Calgary wind when mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads to the ribosomes. First off, amino acids start banding together at a START codon in the P site - that's initiation. Then it keeps on trucking, adding more amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA shows up in the A site, signaling it's time to wrap things up - we call that elongation and termination. Kind of like how our Maritime weather can suddenly change, right? It's a pretty clever process, just as twisted as Toronto's streets but crucial for life itself!	59da6acff6aba082a4b9ad13359fdfc2	-1	-1
5	1. The Transcript Phase: mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying genetic information from DNA. 2. The Initiation Phase: mRNA attaches to a ribosome and is read in triplets called codons by rRNA, starting protein synthesis. 3. The Elongation Phase: Each codon is met by tRNA bearing a specific amino acid, matching codon to anticodon. 4. The Termination Phase: Amino acids from adjacent tRNAs bond together, building the protein chain until a stop codon signals the end of synthesis.	195b484a1b6f6c84117955069b17a5a9	-1	-1
5	Aye, mRNA maks its way oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, its bases are read in groups o' three, known as codons, by something we call rRNA.	a4384e580927565e2e2af038f6360f6f	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis process begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. As the next step, each tRNA's corresponding amino acids bond with the amino acids on adjacent tRNA, progressively building up the protein sequence.	cec9f6dbdafc4e8a69b956bd28e59326	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it voyages through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus to be decoded by the ribosome in the cytoplasm. The process includes four key steps: Initiation, where the ribosome binds with mRNA; Elongation, whereby tRNA brings in amino acids that correspond with the mRNA codon sequence; this continues until a STOP codon is encountered. The termination phase then ensues, ending the protein synthesis, and a new protein, composed of linked amino acids, is formed.	0f81d691dc80269ff8569c926d2a6b00	-1	-1
5	Isn't it quare? mRNA codons are read by rRNA, just as solid as the Rock of Cashel. The amino acids keep getting linked till a STOP codon puck tells them to halt on mRNA's A site!	aacc4d1b8b3389e4213af906e14f59b6	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. So, it works a little somethin' like this: that ol' mRNA skips outta the nucleus and gets read in groups of three – codons they're called – by the rRNA. Then, tRNA, holdin' an anticodon all ready to match up with the mRNA's codon, comes struttin' in. It’s like findin’ a needle in a haystack, but these molecules manage it every time. Once they pair up, the amino acids ridin' on the tRNA get strung together like beads on grandma's necklace. And there ya have it, that's the gist of protein synthesis laid out for y’all.	cbc7e1519ac1de2b7c879a7fffd46977	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and being recognized by tRNA, which carries the complementary anticodon. This process initiates when a START codon is found in the P site and amino acids start linking together to form a protein chain, which continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site signifies the end of elongation and commencement of termination.	159c0c149f8b8c8fb2f04d214da0da58	-1	-1
5	Alright, protein synthesis kick off when mRNA exit de nucleus through a nuclear pore.

5	Protein synthesis begins with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, initiating the process by linking amino acids together to form proteins starting at a START codon in the P site. This is followed by the reading of mRNA base triplets, known as codons, by rRNA, and the continual linkage of amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read at the A site, marking elongation and termination of protein synthesis.	043a7ea1bc42694404516e5dfaf30d10	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosome where its bases are read in sets of three, called codons, by rRNA. 2. tRNA, carrying complementary anticodon, recognizes and binds to the corresponding mRNA codon. 3. This process continues with amino acids being linked together, forming a chain. 4. When a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site, this signals the end of the protein synthesis process.	6a22549b6559ae08a413e5beb5d6bc1b	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA makes like a bat out of hell from the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Then tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, locks onto the mRNA's codon like white on rice. After that, it's just the process of adding a new corresponding amino acid to the lengthening chain on the tRNA, as regular as clockwork.	7492decdc48462e884fdcc2dcfbb4883	-1	-1
5	Right, so mRNA scoots out the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it's read in groups of three, known as codons, by the rRNA. As each codon is read, a new matching amino acid is hitched to its tRNA partner, which are then bonded together to knap the protein.	df681fe2f414e892c85cd8d38d6abbec	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA has exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it navigates through the cytoplasm and finds its way to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, tRNA bearing the corresponding anticodon identifies and binds to the complementary codon of the mRNA, facilitating U=A, C+G pairings.	f7bef41ea209216fdd908fd892be6cb4	-1	-1
5	Post-nuclear egress, mRNA navigates to the ribosome via the cytoplasm or penetrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where rRNA interprets its base triplets, known as codons. Elongation and termination occur as amino acids are continually connected until an mRNA STOP codon is detected in the A site.	77d695b323737a7629427bbe14e98e79	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when the mRNA, having exited the nucleus, aligns with a START codon in the P site of the ribosome, which is where the first corresponding amino acid is added to the transfer RNA (tRNA). This process of adding amino acids continues, one by one, leading to the formation of a protein chain, up until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified in the A site, signaling for elongation and termination of the protein synthesis.	13e75ebab6e4dbd9b4c2508c1b537003	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA is deciphered in codon triplets by rRNA. Subsequently, the respective amino acids tethered to each tRNA are covalently linked to the amino acids on adjacent tRNAs.	21e6dd7e5983d1186f5d8ea899653e48	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis starts wicked fast with the mRNA bolting from the nucleus via the nuclear pore, right? Now it's out there in the cytoplasm ready to go. Then, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon shows up and acknowledges the corresponding codon of the mRNA, like ""Hey buddy, I know you!"" The next thing you know, the amino acids thrown by the other end of the tRNA are getting cozy and bonding with the neighboring tRNA’s amino acids. It's a whole process -- denser than chowder, but stronger than a Southie dockworker. Gotta love biology, kid!"	67e18d62ea3ab88db0893ec570366611	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA breaking away from the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This is followed by initiation where amino acids are strung together, starting with a START codon in the P site; then the matching amino acids at the culmination of the tRNA are bonded to the amino acids adjacent to other tRNA's.	afca4483ef588ed9213467cdddf63355	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA, which departs from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, we witness the first step of protein synthesis known as initiation, where amino acids begin to connect together at the START codon located in the P site. This is followed by the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids on different tRNA molecules, building up the protein structure in a process as solid as Canadian Shield.	e41a358a767d58540d29fb9b9583286b	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA departs the nucleus via nuclear pore, it traverses the cytoplasm until reaching the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Amino acids are then sequentially linked and protein synthesis persists until a STOP codon is identified on the mRNA in the A-site, signaling elongation and termination of the process.	946a7b099256e93a0ec3a29c94f2309b	-1	-1
5	Efter leavin the nucleus, mRNA makes its journey through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or gans intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, tRNA wi' the complementary anticodon kens the matching codon o' the mRNA an’ links up amino acids till a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, puttin a halt to the process.	c8032d4fb6313ed3a316f5b5250384c7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with the export of mRNA from the nucleus, subsequently getting read by rRNA in codonic triplets, hence guiding tRNA to fetch the corresponding amino acids. Then a peptide bond forms between adjacent amino acids on the tRNA, while a novel matching amino acid is incorporated onto the tRNA, continually extending the nascent polypeptide chain.	007ef34b3e8c615e4e91d650d8560b16	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA's egress from the nucleus, protein synthesis unfolds in four significant stages. First, mRNA base sequences are deciphered into triplets known as codons by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), then the peptide chain initiation is triggered by a START codon in the P site which links amino acids together to form a protein. Subsequently, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) dock onto these codons carrying corresponding amino acids, and finally, through the process of elongation, these amino acids are conjoined to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, thereby extending the polypeptide chain.	b924805568fa1c6243d1e5ae4a59eab5	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the initiation phase, an mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and a protein synthesis is initiated when a START codon in the P site is recognised. This process involves the recognition of the complementary codon on the mRNA by a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), followed by continuous linking of amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected - marking the elongation and termination phases.	b84cfe30de1bd8fe40df12ea76f23d24	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis involves several bang on steps. First, mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA, as solid as the Rock of Cashel. Then a new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, wet as an otter's pocket. Lastly, the amino acids continue to be linked like a well-oiled machine until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and signalling termination.	edd4f8b51e03a42e78448a4be8ed9a21	-1	-1
5	Well now, startin' with that mRNA a-leavin' the nucleus, first thing's initiation where amino acids get to makin' protein at that START codon in the P site. Then we got elongation and termination - that's when the amino acids keep on linkin' till they hit a STOP codon on that mRNA in the A site, each time addin' a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. Like plantin' rows of corn, one after another, till your field's full.	36fba15d86adf28b983281ab0f19f7d6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA moving out from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it then initiates the process as amino acids are assembled beginning with a START codon in the P site.

5	Protein synthesis start when mRNA leave nucleus and rRNA read the mRNA bases in groups of three, we call them codons. Then, tRNA get one new matching amino acid and they link up to make protein, starting at a place with a START codon.	c71dd0aff9c2c7acd38dc99de42d4053	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, which then moves to the ribosome where its bases are read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA.

5	1. Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being read in groups of three bases known as codons by rRNA. 2. Next, tRNA carries corresponding amino acids that bond together on its other end. 3. The process of creating a protein chain begins with a START codon positioned in the P site, linking amino acids together. 4. This continues until a STOP codon is reached, finishing the protein synthesis.	4ecc091fe8259ce8bfbc999833de7721	-1	-1
5	First off, that mRNA skips outta the nucleus and hitchhikes a ride to the ribosome or meanders into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then those tRNA fellers bring in their amino acids and start bondin' them together like a chain. They keep addin' links to this chain till they hit a STOP sign on the mRNA highway, then it's party over.	0507c2104c7a3da505f587c7c23ce8bf	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off wi' mRNA scarpering the nucleus, making way tae the ribosome where it all starts with a START codon in the P site, linking up amino acids to create a protein - that's initiation for ye.

Lastly, a new amino acid gets chucked into the mix, adding on to the tRNA.	04e6b341e59865b87f598d80dadedf16	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it travels either to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and moving into the cytoplasm, where it either travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the corresponding amino acids on one end of the tRNA bind to the adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, forming a chain that eventually becomes a protein.	19bde6f35b79e86c9b67c09a5ab64399	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with a START codon in the P site, setting off a chain of events where corresponding amino acids attached to tRNA molecules are bonded together. The process of linking these amino acids, known as elongation, persists until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, signalling termination and the end of protein assembly.	79265c09752484ec8b453737c3a00e4c	-1	-1
5	First off, protein synthesis kicks into gear when mRNA scoots out of the nucleus and amino acids start linking together at a START codon in the P site - that's initiation for ya. Then, a new amino acid gets added to tRNA, and this process keeps rolling until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site during elongation and termination, creating a shiny, new protein.	454639096a2b5ea24abbc1eb55ca442f	-1	-1
5	After leaving the nucleus, mRNA takes a leisurely stroll, slow as a wet week, through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. This triggers a small-small dance where tRNA's amino acids bond with adjacent ones until a STOP codon on the mRNA, cold as a Jo'burg morning, halts the party, concluding protein synthesis.	ac0d69f1ad69fe9730a8614a3c8a85d2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it hooks up with ribosomes where a START codon in the P site signals the kick-off of amino acids linking together to form a protein. This process, called initiation, continues in an elongation phase until a STOP codon on the mRNA located in the A site is read, marking the end or termination of protein formation.	03bad83dc01825e4e3a1fd975353203c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and initiates the process by aligning a START codon in the P site, triggering the linkage of amino acids.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA, carrying the genetic code, leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. This code is then translated during initiation at the START codon in the P site, linking amino acids together to form a protein, with each new corresponding amino acid being added to the tRNA.	9757d339fae34954d84e6596cdce7047	-1	-1
5	Bang on then, protein synthesis starts with mRNA heading out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It moves on to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm, where its bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA.	e581f8589742c958db86f4bcd4fe2e18	-1	-1
5	"Well, I reckon it all kicks off when that mRNA saddles up and heads on out from the nucleus. First off, these little things called amino acids get themselves strung together into a protein, kinda like beads on a necklace. They start this process with what's known as a START codon sitting pretty in the P site; consider this the ""go"" signal for this whole shebang. Next up, those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, or triplets, which folks round these parts call codons. This job is handled by something called rRNA. Last but not least, there's another player in the game called tRNA. Now, this guy carries what we call an anticodon, and he's got the job of recognizing and latching on to the complementary codon of that mRNA. It's a bit like finding your dance partner at a hoedown - if the fit ain't right, the dance just won't flow. Proper pairing here means U's gotta match with A, and C should be shuffling along with G. And that, my friend, is protein synthesis in a nutshell!"	6cd54e3ef80e219e31e7d79778617154	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it voyages through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum. The process of protein synthesis proceeds as tRNA consistently adds new matching amino acids, and this elongation of the amino acid chain continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is recognized in the A site, signaling the termination of protein synthesis.	662f0df1e9e4a1b50b69f17d19465d7d	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA wey lef de nucleus, it does go tru de cytoplasm tah reach de ribosome or it go een de rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA, and in a process known as initiation, amino acids are linked together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site.	2542e532f470918e83b60b0a0893c7d2	-1	-1
5	Step one in protein synthesis starts when the mRNA departs from nucleus and moves towards the ribosome. Then, the process of initiation begins when the amino acids are linked together to form a protein, starting from the START codon situated on P site. Next, the mRNA bases are interpreted in groups of three, which are also known as codons, with this reading being done by rRNA. Lastly, on the opposite end of the tRNA, these corresponding amino acids are bonded together with the amino acids on adjacent tRNA. This completes the four major steps involved in synthesizing protein.	64e13a797014e140327874dd5ddc700a	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, let's kick this off with mRNA scootin' outta the nucleus. First thing that happens is what we call initiation - that's when the amino acids get linked up to start makin' a protein, all kick-started by a START codon in the P site. Then, these little guys called tRNA, carryin’ the complementary anticodon, recognize the matching codon of the mRNA, faster than a jackrabbit on a date. Lastly, them corresponding amino acids at the tippy-top end of the tRNA get bonded to the neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, finer than frog hair split four ways.	da03dace63a0c9e1187d5f2a68c74eca	-1	-1
5	Right, so let's talk about this wee journey that mRNA goes on during protein synthesis. Firstly, it bails from the nucleus through a nuclear pore and then, quick as a highland hare, it darts through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or heads into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next big step for it is when tRNA comes into play, carryin' the matchin' anticodon – we're talking U equals A and C plus G here – which can recognise and pair up wi' the complementary codon of the mRNA.	081f2201cfb8dcaf2da01968ee814854	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and either reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. This is followed by tRNA, bearing the anticodon that corresponds to mRNA's codon (U=A, C+G), recognising its counterpart on the mRNA, thus enabling amino acids to form links until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA within the A site, signalling the cessation of this extension and termination process.	5d5736c89973e0a9b18aff826116d58e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where mRNA, having left the nucleus, binds to a ribosome and a tRNA molecule carrying a START codon enters the P site, marking the beginning of the protein chain. Following this, in the elongation phase, other tRNAs carrying amino acids recognize and bind to the complementary codons on the mRNA sequence through their anticodons (U=A, C=G), leading to the creation of a series of linked amino acids that will eventually form the protein.	2de6aa6f5f53c9b2fc9f0d21469adef7	-1	-1
5	Starting with the transportation of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplic reticulum, the protein synthesis begins. The process initiates with a START codon in the P site, linking amino acids together to form a protein chain, while concurrently, a corresponding new amino acid is attached to the tRNA, ensuring precise protein formation.	707b83e977e7fb7d98aeab6234ec72b7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA, carrying genetic information, exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and is read by rRNA in triplets known as codons. This sequence initiates with a START codon in the P site, prompting the linking together of amino acids to create the desired protein.	fcf1265953ee77365dfed85df947c6cd	-1	-1
5	Ah right, kickin' off with that mRNA skedaddlin' outta the nucleus, it heads straight to the ribosome or dives into the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, ya got yer tRNA, haulin' the anticodon that's a match made in heaven with the mRNA's codon - we're talkin' U paired with A, and C cozying up with G. To cap it all off, a fresh amino acid is slapped onto that tRNA.	457d04c904c7c9742220ac84236c3b2c	-1	-1
5	Alright, so it starts with the mRNA sneaking out of the nucleus and going on a journey through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, right? Then it's all systems go, kind of like a rugby player breaking from a scrum, as the amino acids start linking in the P site from the START codon, carrying on strong as a lion until they hit a STOP codon in the A site. That's basically how proteins get made, bru - step for step as sure as Table Mountain towers over Cape Town.	4ad191829ea631e0ce762afae32f9145	-1	-1
5	Sure thing! Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA making a swift exit from the nucleus, much like a Calgary wind, and venturing through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, steady as a Canuck's resolve, the tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, identifies the matching codon on the mRNA. To wrap it up, just as cold as a Yukon winter introduces a new season - a fresh corresponding amino acid gets added to the tRNA, moving us one step closer to a completed protein.	0d28b9a95ea68ae23b0fe75402d8204e	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and enters the cytoplasm. The mRNA bases are then read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, which is followed by tRNA carrying anticodons that match the mRNA's codon sequence, allowing the formation of a protein based on this blueprint.	7088edae71166036912e6e521f3c4012	-1	-1
5	Stairtin wi mRNA leavin the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is whan the tRNA introduces a matchin amino acid. Then, these amino acids link thegither, bein bonded til the next ane on the tRNA.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and moving to the cytoplasm where it becomes accessible to transfer RNA (tRNA) which recognizes and binds to complementary codons on the mRNA. The tRNA carries corresponding amino acids, which are then bonded together in a sequence determined by the mRNA code; this process continues until a STOP codon is read, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	acb8243b4f2e64c880f31a0948b263e1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus, where it carries genetic codes that are translated in the initiation process using a START codon at the P site into a chain of amino acids to form a protein. This translation and linkage of amino acids persist until a STOP codon on the mRNA is detected at the A site during the elongation and termination phases; throughout this process, each tRNA's corresponding amino acids are conjoined to those of neighbouring tRNA molecules.	042248bdcd3b453dd5f40bd7750ec901	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves several key steps beginning with mRNA, which carries the genetic instructions, leaving the nucleus. The first step, initiation, sees the mRNA attach to a ribosome and the process begins with a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are linked together to form a protein. This process is known as elongation, and it continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is encountered, marking the phase of termination. Concurrently, each tRNA molecule brings a specific amino acid into position and adds it to the growing protein chain.	360786174f0e3936d91a09ce88b31bb7	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA skips out of the nucleus and its bases are read in triplets known as codons, as accurate as a bullseye. Then, tRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with the complementary anticodon, recognises the corresponding codon of the mRNA. Following this, like a builder at a site, a new matching amino acid is added to the tRNA, solid as the Rock of Cashel.	cdb54579f74fcf746d9c675114d2a491	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin' such a fine question! It's kinda like findin' a needle in a haystack, but I'll give it a shot. Now, the first thing that happens after mRNA skips out of the nucleus is it gets read in chunks of three, sorta like how you'd read a good recipe. These chunks are called codons and they're scanned by somethin' called rRNA. Step two is like a good ole game of match-up. tRNA, carryin' what we call an anticodon, finds its pair on the mRNA codon - reckon it's a bit like findin' your dance partner at a hoedown. Lastly, once the tRNA has found its match, it bonds its own amino acids to the next tRNA's amino acids. This here process can be slower than molasses in January, but it's important as all get-out for making proteins.	9c85b84584c19426e58c72bfbe3da577	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, protein synthesis begins as mRNA reaches the ribosome in the cytoplasm where the process of initiation occurs, this is when amino acids start to connect together triggered by a START codon located in the P site. The journey continues as tRNA carries specific amino acids, linking them together in a chain, this formation is bonded to adjacent tRNAs' amino acids, thereby building a protein, and sometimes this process takes place within the rough endoplasmic reticulum.	e1cb805adea8553d78476d433a0714d6	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and journeying through the cytoplasm to rendezvous with the ribosome, or sometimes it even ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the mRNA's bases which are grouped in triplets called codons, then a tRNA molecule carrying the complementary anticodon recognizes and pairs up with each codon on the mRNA, creating a beautiful molecular dance that results in protein creation.	dc5df680a9aac1369e3ae6e823f1af75	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA exiting nucleus: After being created in the nucleus, mRNA travels into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosome; or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Codon formation: The mRNA bases are grouped into triplets known as codons, which are read by rRNA inside the ribosome. 3. tRNA and amino acids: Each codon signals a specific tRNA molecule carrying a corresponding amino acid to match up with it. 4. Polypeptide chain formation: As each tRNA adds its amino acid and detaches, a polypeptide chain is formed, which folds into a protein.	58510ac6e8da708190ca05fdf6b2bf1a	-1	-1
5	Well now, after the mRNA high-tails it outta the nucleus, it skedaddles through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or that rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, those mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, by our good friend rRNA. Lastly, those correlatin' amino acids at the flip side of the tRNA get hitched to the neighborin' tRNA's amino acids. Quite a process, ain't it?	541bbb0d525f08712f74b89aa3f71d01	-1	-1
5	Alreet, let's kick aff wi' mRNA scramblin' oot the nucleus, eh? Protein synthesis starts when amino acids git stitched thegither, a process kicking off wi' a START codon in the P site. New amino acids are then continually added to each tRNA. Finally, these corresponding amino acids at the other end of the tRNA get bonded together with adjacent tRNA's amino acids, resultin' in a bonnie protein ready for action.	41af3156287ad1c1132e2658db92321a	-1	-1
5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus, where does it go? To the ribosome via the cytoplasm or through entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum, having exited the nucleus via a nuclear pore. Now, isn't it intriguing that tRNA, carrying an anticodon which pairs with the codon of mRNA following a complementary pairing rule (U=A, C+G), recognizes and binds to this codon on mRNA?	3f42a712bbcb4bd7df7cae7cc97bdc7c	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic information.

5	The majestic journey of protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the coded information required to produce a protein. The game of match-making then unfolds as tRNA, bearing the complementary anticodon (with U matching A and C pairing with G), identifies its perfect match in mRNA's codon. Now, comes the magic - starting with a START codon strategically placed in the P site, amino acids begin to link together, forming the intricate chain that will eventually become a protein. Isn't it fascinating how these steps highlight the preciseness and complexity involved in protein synthesis?	230230379add9af336db9f2c79ad1a5d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read by tRNA, which carries the anticodon that pairs perfectly with the mRNA's codon, doesn't it? This tRNA not only recognises and binds to the mRNA, but also brings along a new amino acid which is subsequently added to its structure, aiding in the creation of a unique protein as these amino acids are bonded together on adjacent tRNAs, wouldn't you agree?	c93f2230e7e9eafd5371aae09692160c	-1	-1
5	So, ya know when mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus? First off, it gets read in groups of three - we call 'em codons, like reading a book three letters at a time. Then this lil' guy called tRNA swings by and recognizes those groups of three, kinda like your buddy recognizing your face in a crowd at Fenway. He's packing an anticodon, the exact match to that mRNA codon. Smaller than a clam's hindquarters, but sharper than a Sox fan's wit. Once they've found their perfect match, faster than a car on the Pike, tRNA adds a shiny new amino acid. It's kinda like building a brick wall one brick at a time, each one fitting just right.	acc3d81fcdacf3320ae3a7fc87233ccb	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA says cheers to the nucleus and ambles through the cytoplasm to find a lekker spot at the ribosome or maybe the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where it gets interesting, right? The tRNA, strong as a lion, carries an anticodon that's like a mirror image of the mRNA codon (You know, U matches A, and C pairs with G). And then what happens? Well, just like a leopard doesn't change its spots, these corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA stick together with the amino acids from their neighbouring tRNA - small-small they start building up a protein.	46c5ca2b1f39fd9289d1e1d41ad9ab0d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, eh? It all kicks off when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a Start codon in the P site initiates the process by linking amino acids to make a protein. Then, tRNA with matching anticodon steps in, recognizing the mRNA's codon like a hockey player spotting an open net. Lastly, it's as if these tRNA are linked elbow-to-elbow at a Tim Horton's counter because they bond their carried amino acids together. So, from mRNA leaving the nucleus to bonding of amino acids, protein synthesis is as steady as a Canuck's resolve!	d0d687ca9257bfa0e3c1a9001fbb0796	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus and is followed by initiation where a START codon in the P site triggers the linkage of amino acids to form protein. This process is recognized and facilitated by tRNA that carries the complementary anticodon matching the mRNA's codon, and it continues in an elongation phase until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, signaling termination.	75d9a999fd96d60665ad171c0b406ff3	-1	-1
5	Weel, efter the mRNA's dun an left the nucleus, it makes a beeline through the cytoplasm tae find itsel a ribosome or it micht even pop intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then the tRNA wi' the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) steps up an recognises the complementary codon o' that mRNA. An' as if by magic, a brand new corresponding amino acid gets added to the tRNA, fair do's!	24b5b13db47354029c85c50814c595c1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA moving out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It then gets matched with appropriate tRNA molecules, which carry specific amino acids that are added to the growing protein chain as they bond to the adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	c4166e70fd4870b4b863b396ef1d3ef3	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus, it journeys through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, marking the beginning of protein synthesis. Here, a specific tRNA molecule, carrying an associated amino acid, pairs with its complementary mRNA codon; this results in a new corresponding amino acid being added to the elongating polypeptide chain, and these amino acids are bonded together, gradually constructing our desired protein.	292df4918ffcd28c4ee256d08b424c95	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, heralding a sequential process where corresponding amino acids are continually added to tRNA molecules. This leads to the creation of peptide bonds between these adjacent amino acids, essentially forming the backbone of the newly synthesised protein.	9ccb897ff8a2d1caa60643e327345f2b	-1	-1
5	Well now, isn't protein synthesis as solid as the Rock of Cashel? It all kicks off with our mRNA reading bases in triplets, known as codons, much like looking for hen's teeth. Then it's onto initiation, where amino acids start to get friendly and link up at the START codon in the P site, quick as greased lightning. This party doesn't stop until a STOP codon pops up on the mRNA in the A site, signalling the end of elongation and termination. So there you have it - that's our wee dance of life!	4a1f0fadf2c33768adb873d5909d9963	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for askin'. First off, mRNA takes a trip out the nucleus loaded with instructions. Then, like a well-tuned orchestra, rRNA reads these instructions in threes called codons. When the start codon's at the P site, that's when the protein makin' party starts -- it's like openin' the gate at a rodeo! Amino acids hightail it from one end to the other, linkin' together like a bunch of old pals until they see that stop codon waitin' at the A site. Yup, that's when they know it's time to call it quits - job done!	83ea291b3da24e5dcd8c01e1b5ae6f4b	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then it's decoded in triplets called codons by rRNA. The amino acids linked to the tRNA are subsequently joined with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, completing the protein formation process.	4be677bd25809f7ad7ef25fbee0f1c86	-1	-1
5	"Protein synthesis, dat big dance of life, start off when mRNA breeze out the nucleus. It then get read in three-part beats called codons by the rRNA, and each beat call up a new amino acid to join the tRNA band. The jamming keep on going, one amino acid after another, until a STOP codon show up on the mRNA and say, ""Party done!"" That's how proteins get build, step by step, in the elongation and termination phase."	06b535ad078a9951b012b1768bb1cbaf	-1	-1
5	Once the mRNA departs the nucleus, it voyages through the cytoplasm to commandeer a ribosome or infiltrate the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of threes known as codons and for each codon, a matching amino acid is summoned and tacked onto the burgeoning tRNA.	b660ce4843be48b63106713f24f4445f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs nucleus, traveling to ribosomes in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis process. 2. Transfer RNA (tRNA), with anticodons complementary to mRNA codons, identifies matching mRNA codons. 3. Each tRNA carries specific amino acids, and these are linked together based on match between mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons. 4. This chain of amino acids grows until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered, ceasing the linkage of amino acids, thus finalizing protein synthesis.	691d6ca1071ce631a669a91d1216b619	-1	-1
5	Alrighty then, after mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus, it hightails it through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now here's where tRNA comes into play - it's totin' the complementary anticodon which lines up just right with mRNA's codon. The amino acids that are hitchin' a ride on tRNA get cosy with the ones on adjacent tRNA molecules and they bond together, startin' the process of makin' protein.	95ebf4784c1b8e4208fe6b85884db0a6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off when mRNA bails out the nucleus, starting wi' a START codon in the P site that gets the ball rollin' by hookin' up amino acids to craft a protein. Next, tRNA chums carryin' the matchin' anticodon recognise their pal, the mRNA's codon, and those corresponding amino acids at the other end of the tRNA get all friendly like and bond with adjacent tRNA's amino acids. All as round as pease, ye ken?	62535ecd8b0fd76ccca4f7986abc83ad	-1	-1
5	After its creation, mRNA bolts from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, eager to perform its mission. In the cytoplasm, it encounters rRNA which reads its message in triplets known as codons, and subsequently, tRNA swoops in with a complementary anticodon, ready to recognise and bind with the corresponding codon on the mRNA - an action-packed relay of information leading to protein synthesis!	6d47323c42ba08d661f06b7dafbd970d	-1	-1
5	Initiating with the mRNA's dynamic journey from the nucleus to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, it's then deciphered in triplets known as codons through the rRNA in a vivid dance of molecular interaction. Swiftly after, tRNA enters the scene carrying the complementary anticodon, perfectly matching and recognizing each codon on the mRNA, thereby enhancing this intricate process of protein synthesis.	1b440788c960e24c773b1b268441f2d1	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA, freshly out from the nucleus, where it meets tRNA carrying anticodons that perfectly match its codons, thanks to the complementary base pairing rules (U=A, C+G). This tRNA also carries with it corresponding amino acids which are ready to get bonded to the neighboring tRNA's amino acids. As this process repeats, each new tRNA brings along a fresh batch of corresponding amino acids to be added, leading to the formation of a dynamic, growing protein chain.	09977ae1180b157fc33d3285bf291ce6	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it navigates through the cytoplasm to find a ribosome or it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA molecules, carrying anticodons that match the codons on the mRNA, bring corresponding amino acids which are then linked together until a stop codon on the mRNA is encountered, signalling the end of protein synthesis.	3de1e0c295dc95563e9712e92ca165ce	-1	-1
5	"Boom, outta the gate, mRNA pulls a Houdini and slips out of the nucleus through this tiny window called a nuclear pore; no time to dilly-dally. Then we got this whole dance number going on - the tRNA's bringing the right amino acids based on mRNA's orders, it's like a line of Southie dockworkers passing along heavy crates. They keep at it, tougher than a Nor'easter until some wise guy called a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA A site, says ""That’s all folks!"" and calls it a day."	7100d4931891d8cbad9990c0fc9d45e9	-1	-1
5	In the jol of protein synthesis, mRNA bulls out the nucleus and hits the ribosome dance floor where it sets off the groove with a START codon in the P site, like firing the starting gun at Comrades. Then, each tRNA boogie-master brings their own amino acid partner to the jam, linking them together in a chain as long as the Orange River until a STOP codon pops up, bringing an end to the shindig - this is initiation, elongation and termination. The amino acids at each tRNA's arm lock into a lekker bond with their neighbours, forming a protein as unique as a Protea in full bloom.	c0a84a92da32ce7e47c4d0920d1f16d2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is like a hot game of tag in Toronto in July, beginning with mRNA darting out of the nucleus and a START codon setting the pace in the P site (Initiation). The tRNA, swift as a Calgary wind, recognizes the mRNA's codon like long-lost pals, aligns its complementary anticodon (like U with A, C with G) and promptly brings along a new corresponding amino acid to join this lively protein party!	50d1b6150a64f58acf031a40470b38ed	-1	-1
5	Kicking off the protein synthesis, mRNA audaciously sprints out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. As it races onto the ribosome, an assertive START codon in the P site triggers the initiation of a protein, while each tRNA boldly steps up, contributes its corresponding amino acid and adds to the burgeoning chain, progressively crafting an intricate protein masterpiece.	70910ca2e4e5bd5bc1e05bdc5f4cab98	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA, efter bein made in the nucleus, darts oot through a nuclear pore tae reach the cytoplasm. Then it's a case o' the tRNA wi' its complementary anticodon (mind ye, U=A and C+G), recognising the matching codon on the mRNA, and the amino acids carried by each tRNA start bonding together wi' their neighbours, creating a growin' protein chain.	80077ae3634f92740c6175df04ee742a	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis ignites into action as mRNA, carrying the genetic code, bravely exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore. On its journey through the cytoplasm, it either joins the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, known as codons.	e4c2196f630198990397516acf1a6ff8	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA departure from the nucleus, protein synthesis involves four major steps. Firstly, mRNA bases are examined in triplets known as codons by rRNA—this is an intricate dance of molecular interaction! Secondly, for each mRNA codon, a corresponding tRNA molecule carrying a specific amino acid binds to it, creating an ever-growing peptide chain. Thirdly, this miraculous queue of amino acids continues to elongate until a stop codon on the mRNA is recognized at the A site—think of it like a punctuation mark in our protein sentence! Lastly, the protein is released and the process terminates, marking another successful round of nature's fantastic cellular machinery!	961517d951af8b8bc9e60c656aeaf266	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, the first major step in protein synthesis is initiation, where a START codon is identified in the P site and protein production begins. The subsequent steps involve tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognising the complementary codon of the mRNA, followed by a bonding process where the corresponding amino acids at the end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, thus creating an elongating chain that eventually forms a protein.	f76d4fe9d9f927467a834e6966bb8789	-1	-1
5	Sure, the whole protein synthesis shindig starts off with mRNA sneaking out of the nucleus like a fox in the henhouse. Next, this clever strand of mRNA finds the ribosome where it's read like an open book, in triplicate codons no less! Now comes the interesting bit, tRNA carrying amino acids puck up to the party bringing in their payload. These amino acid lads get cosy and link up, until a stop sign, or a STOP codon, appears on the mRNA putting an end to the festivities. Not as complex as it seems, is it?	72414f719cdd27c049d559a22a12e0a8	-1	-1
5	"Well, here's how this dance goes down, y'all. Once that mRNA scoots on out of the nucleus, it gets read in chunks called codons by rRNA, sorta like deciphering a secret code. Next thing you know, a ""starter pistol"" fires off with a START codon in the P site and those little amino acids get to linking up to make a protein. Just when you thought it was over, a new corresponding amino acid gets added to tRNA, making the chain longer than a Sunday sermon."	50b21574b8d68080e81215770de48209	-1	-1

5	Alrighty then, so y'see that mRNA? It's high-tailing it outta the nucleus through somethin' called a nuclear pore.

Next up, tRNA, which is carrying an anticodon that fits together with the mRNA's codon like a hand in a glove (U=A and C=G), recognises its mate on the mRNA. So, there you have it - the main events in protein synthesis.	26c4aca39a300b5467e9c356879a0e5b	-1	-1

Protein synthesis down pat.	94ba82041295cc5a725aa501c257b678	-1	-1
5	Quick-quick, as the mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, it meets tRNA that's as dry as the Karoo, waiting to recognise its complementary codon. This leads to a veld fire of activity where each tRNA, charged with a new corresponding amino acid, lines up its anticodon against mRNA's codon. After the bonding session, like a lekker braai, adjacent tRNA’s amino acids form a strong link, resulting in protein synthesis.	223ec18aa1b6b327899474766502d359	-1	-1
5	Once mRNA vacates the nucleus, it's read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA.

The protein synthesis process kicks off with an mRNA leaving the nucleus, which allows a START codon to position itself in the P site and initiate the linking of amino acids to form a protein. Then, a tRNA carrying the anticodon that matches the mRNA's codon enters the scene, recognizes this codon and hauls in a fresh amino acid to be added to the budding protein.	80baefc2074c5f16c5a8f74d62889ea1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, a process called initiation starts with a START codon on the P site, leading to amino acids being linked together to form a protein, and each time a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.	21859b14470028061b1fcbdda89a454c	-1	-1

5	Starting from the nucleus, like a veld fire racing across the plains, our little messenger RNA (mRNA) zoots out through one of the nuclear pores. Once it reaches the ribosome, it does a jol of sorts with transfer RNA (tRNA), which is carrying its partner in crime – an amino acid. It's kind of like a relay race, where each tRNA passes on the amino acid to its neighbour until a STOP sign flashes up on the mRNA. This process continues, strong as a lion and persistent as a Jo'burg morning, linking these amino acids together in a chain, until they eventually form a fully-fledged protein.	f5f88625e2915f97e9a30c6b0f609b11	-1	-1

5	Commencing with the liberation of mRNA from the nucleus, protein synthesis encompasses four pivotal steps. Firstly, the initiation event, where a START codon in the P site triggers the bonding of amino acids to form a protein; secondly, tRNA incorporates a new matching amino acid; thirdly, mRNA's bases are deciphered in sets of three, known as codons by rRNA, making way for the final step; and lastly, when a STOP codon is encountered, translation halts and the newly formed protein is released.	fb45f9f2bf92f97c695197e0b699f128	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA scoots oot the nucleus via a nuclear pore, like a loon aff tae play footie. Next, a new matchin' amino acid gets added tae the tRNA, as ye might add milk tae yer mornin' cuppa. Then these braw amino acids get strung together tae make a protein, startin' wi' a START codon in the P site - it's like startin' a ceilidh wi' a good reel.	fa898e00a1cc3301734317b55ed5021b	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis commences when mRNA, armed with the genetic code, leaves the comfort of the nucleus and enters the battlefield of the cell - either making its way to a ribosome or infiltrating the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA soldiers, bearing complementary anticodons, recognize and align with their paired codons on the mRNA message, an operation commencing with a START codon at the P site, effectively paving the way for the assembly line where amino acids are strategically linked together to form the powerful entity known as a protein.	1ca0af1bad1d511c84ad939e46da2bc0	-1	-1
5	Beginning with a START codon positioned at the P site, protein synthesis initiates by linking together corresponding amino acids found on the tRNA. This process continues, with each amino acid bonded to its neighbor, until a STOP codon appears on the mRNA at the A site, signifying the elongation and termination phases of this intricate biological dance.	77d7f238444c70d9e5d66ceea8aa48cf	-1	-1
5	In the grand dance of biology, the mRNA, having bid farewell to the nucleus, waltzes through the cytoplasm and finds its partner - the ribosome or perhaps it enters the stage of rough endoplasmic reticulum. As the music swells, each tRNA twirls into the spotlight, flaunting a freshly attached amino acid which then elegantly bonds with its neighbouring tRNA’s amino acid, creating an intricate chain of connection and growth.	15c54abf0ab11749fe9a546cc4791ef4	-1	-1
5	Like a letter flying out of its envelope, mRNA bolts from the nucleus as fast as greased lightning through a nuclear pore. It then takes a jaunt through the cytoplasm, heading bang on to the ribosome or dipping into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and then it's off to the races linking amino acids together to form a protein, kicking off with a START codon in the P site, wet as an otter's pocket in initiation.	34aa3cda50cf1dc10e6831170d547f01	-1	-1
5	Well now, first things first, that mRNA has gotta skedaddle on outta the nucleus through a little door we call the nuclear pore. Next up, we got this here fella called tRNA, who's sharp as a tack and spots the matching codon on the mRNA just like findin' a needle in a haystack. Now it's time for tRNA to show off its other trick - it carries along an amino acid that's just perfect match with its anticodon. Last but not least, these amino acids start stickin' together like two peas in a pod.	39776a53b001a54b111f3d7ca7f40c45	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA departing the nucleus and being read by rRNA in sets of three bases known as codons. The process continues with tRNA recognizing and binding to the complementary codon on the mRNA, and amino acids are then assembled into a protein chain, starting from a specific START codon in what is known as the initiation phase.	03ca043a700647c2620d6811685b983d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis, it start when mRNA leave de nucleus and kick off wid a START codon in de P site linking up amino acids fi make a protein - that's initiation. Den, dem amino acids weh deh pon one end of the tRNA, dem get bonded to di amino acids 'pon neighboring tRNA. After that, di mRNA bases read in groups of three, we call dat codons, by rRNA.	559bf202f07304a3841d656a7c31a61f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with initiation, where a START codon on the mRNA in the P site signals the linking together of amino acids which forms a protein. This process, known as elongation, continues as each new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read, indicating termination or the end of protein synthesis.	cdb7ff75d6d5b32107bceca157681d5f	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA, carrying the genetic information for protein creation, leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore. The process of protein synthesis starts with initiation where the START codon is recognized and amino acids are linked together in the P site. Then, tRNA aids in linking corresponding amino acids to adjacent ones, progressively creating a chain that eventually forms a complete protein.	8941f92f1e55da5e0ab7a780e9b74670	-1	-1
5	Well, once that mRNA skedaddles outta the nucleus, it makes a beeline for the cytoplasm and hitches a ride on either a ribosome or takes a detour into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, like herding cats, the tRNA with its matching anticodon (where U pairs up with A and C with G) recognizes the same codon on the mRNA. With everything lined up tighter than bark on a tree, the tRNA's amino acids get friendly, bonding with their neighbors.	9928701a6867f36b4fd62c6f9d945a06	-1	-1
5	Well, hing oan tae yer hat 'cause this will be a braw journey! First off, mRNA flits oot the nucleus like a wean chasing a footie, making tracks tae either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. There, it's as busy as a wee bee, each mRNA codon getting paired up wi' its matching tRNA anticodon and in doing so, a fresh amino acid gets added to that tRNA. It's nae wind, nae wave 'til the corresponding amino acids at the other end of these tRNAs bond wi' the amino acids on adjacent tRNAs - just like pals linking arms at a ceilidh! Nae mair, nae less, that's how proteins get synthesized.	c138f67c3fb671272c73655290c15d19	-1	-1
5	Embarking on its journey from the nucleus, mRNA voyages through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a critical part of protein synthesis. Here, a fascinating process unfolds as each corresponding amino acid, located on the far end of the tRNA, is bonded with its neighbouring tRNA's amino acids, initiating the formation of a protein that begins with a START codon in the P site, thereby linking together a string of amino acids.	bcc930827e347791dae17d35fdd9ca1f	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA journeying from the nucleus to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The tRNA, carrying corresponding anticodons, recognizes and pairs with the complementary codons on the mRNA strand, which then enables the amino acids on the opposite ends of adjacent tRNAs to bond together, thus forming a protein.	68391a9cea41f3f7033fed967aec3827	-1	-1
5	In the process of protein synthesis, mRNA, having exited the nucleus, journeys through the cytoplasm to find the ribosome or to enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The next stage of this intricate process involves tRNA, armed with a complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G), identifying a matching codon on the mRNA. This is followed by a fascinating bonding event where the amino acids situated at the other end of the tRNA bond with those from adjacent tRNAs, forming a chain that eventually becomes a protein.	ee0578b08e99975cc61e11b0ce6877cc	-1	-1
5	Commencing with mRNA's journey from the nucleus, it traverses through the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This sets in motion protein synthesis where amino acids, determined by a START codon anchored in the P site, are subsequently bonded together, while each tRNA molecule further acquires an additional corresponding amino acid.	d51481fdf2ec8d12018d2e3b036b294a	-1	-1
5	Alright, protein synthesis, right? So fuhst off, the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus like a car on the Pike and it gets read in triplets called codons by this thing called rRNA. Next up, these fellas - tRNA - they got what's called an anticodon, right? And these anticodons find their matching codon on the mRNA. Last but not least, we have a party of amino acids coming together to make a protein - this all begins with a START codon in the P site, sorta like dropping the puck at a Bruins game. That's the gist of it!	fe4b8239172176d266535392d15bd718	-1	-1
5	Sure, bru. Here's the gist of it - when mRNA heads out the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's like leaving the comfort of your Jozi home on a frosty morning. Then the tRNA steps in carrying the complementary anticodon, no different to the fact that a leopard won't change its spots. Finally, amino acids are strung together to form a protein from a START codon in the P site, reaching as high as the Drakensberg.	74cfdcfed86a6e5b14921432403bfb21	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus like a Toronto commuter during rush hour, the protein synthesis process is as involved and intricate as a prairie square dance. First, transfer RNA (tRNA) with matching anticodons, similar to a Vancouverite recognizing their favourite sushi roll, identifies the complementary codon of the mRNA. This tRNA carries the corresponding amino acids, which are bonded to neighbouring tRNA’s amino acids as swiftly as a Calgary wind. The sequence continues in this fashion, as changeable as Maritime weather, until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA — marking the end of the elongation phase and the beginning of termination.	66af5376a794ad4e18437e02a233d368	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences when mRNA, originating from the nucleus, journeys through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Following this, tRNA, carrying the anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA (U=A, C=G), identifies the corresponding mRNA codon, leading to the addition of a corresponding new amino acid to the elongating peptide chain on the tRNA.	03b9391f626bd076c7debf2c9bcb6015	-1	-1
5	First aff, mRNA bides its leave fae the nucleus an' heids towards the ribosome tae kick aff protein synthesis. Next, we hae the initiation phase whaur a START codon in the P site signals that it's time tae set about linkin' amino acids intae a protein. As the process goes alang, new correspondin' amino acids are added tae the tRNA. It keeps on in this road until a STOP codon crops up oan the mRNA in the A site, signalin' it's time tae halt the elongation an' termination phases, bringin' aboot the end o' protein synthesis.	54fc58f4f35a30fa77b5bd9f091a0ea5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences as mRNA leaves the nucleus, journeying to the ribosome located either in the cytoplasm or within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, a process known as elongation takes place, during which corresponding amino acids on tRNA molecules are linked together in a sequence determined by the mRNA until a STOP codon is encountered - this signifies the termination of this intricate and crucial biological procedure.	6b78154a5c6893f195e83c78aded5511	-1	-1
5	The journey of protein synthesis commences with mRNA exiting the nucleus then being read by rRNA in groups of three bases known as codons. Subsequently, these codons signal the initiation of protein production at a START codon in the P site and compel amino acids to link in a chain; each amino acid on one tRNA molecule forms bonds with those on neighboring tRNA molecules, thus fabricating the final protein structure.	13e3622f07e78d4505d91d177085f629	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with mRNA venturing out from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, which then facilitates the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA. The process proceeds further when these corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded together with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids, thereby constructing the protein chain.	21e92889623ca1249266e3e7df3982e8	-1	-1
5	Well, the mRNA makes a dash as fast as greased lightning from the nucleus packing codons, groups of three bases. Then, as sure as eggs is eggs, tRNA with its complement anticodon steps up to the plate recognising the mRNA's codon, bang on it's like seeing double; Finally, the matching amino acids on the tRNA are bonded together, wet as an otter's pocket, forming a protein.	f5e1fa4e78526748ec4c83888bfa911e	-1	-1
5	"Well, sugah, here's how it goes down: That mRNA first scoots on out the nucleus through a lil' ol' nuclear pore. Then, like a good Southern potluck, all sorts of amino acids start to gather 'round and link up starting with a ""START"" codon in what we call the P site (kinda like the kick-off at a football game). Then, wouldn’t ya know it? Those mRNA bases get read in groups of three, sorta like us reading our bingo numbers, and this is done by something called rRNA. That's your protein synthesis in a nutshell, darlin'."	196ea5e8c254aa4ae08bf65005c47c40	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore and ventures into the cytoplasm, either finding a ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, transfer RNA (tRNA) with complimentary amino acids connect and bond to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, orchestrating the formation of the protein.	e6bf6673ad7b09cdef823a72996425c6	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA exits nucleus through nuclear pore and it then travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. Next, the mRNA bases are read in groups of three, called codons, by rRNA in a process known as translation, which initiates protein synthesis.	20592dad85ae249b040c55137ce186ba	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis process begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and traveling through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, then recognizes the corresponding codon of the mRNA, leading to the linking of amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is read - signaling the termination of protein elongation.	9162035cdc12180b7d2b403e2871f02e	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to ribosome where rRNA reads its bases in groups of three known as codons.  2. tRNA brings an amino acid that corresponds with each codon.  3. Starting with START codon in P site, these amino acids are joined together, creating protein, a process called initiation. 4. The process continues until a STOP codon is reached on mRNA bringing an end to protein synthesis (this step known as termination).	b8cb2a80a84ecae9f2382acb1536966d	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, so once that mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's read in groups of three bases called codons by the rRNA.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and migrating to the ribosome through the cytoplasm. At the ribosome, tRNA molecules add individual amino acids in a sequence determined by the mRNA, while also creating bonds between adjacent amino acids, thus forming a protein.	ef03e738b7a7cfdea576015333a7e373	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds to ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which reads the mRNA's codons, or base triplets.  2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) carrying corresponding amino acids attach to the mRNA at these codon sites. 3. Adjacent tRNAs bond their respective amino acids together, forming a polypeptide chain. 4. As the ribosome progresses along the mRNA strand, new tRNAs arrive with their attached amino acids, continuing the process of protein synthesis.	9d7e0c4ce0f419a2726fc8f56af78a73	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and then, in the process known as elongation, tRNAs with complementary anticodons recognise the corresponding codons on the mRNA, linking the carried amino acids accordingly. This continues until a 'STOP' codon is encountered, signalling the termination of this process, resulting in the formation of a complete protein.	a03b0bb7e35a1e73a963f981ab609721	-1	-1
5	Alroight, in the first step, aftah the mRNA scoots out from the nucleus, it gets read by rRNA in triplets, those are called codons. Then for each codon, there's a matchin' amino acid added to the tRNA - this pahrt's smaller than a clam's hindquarters but stronger than a Southie dockworker. Eventually, all these matchin' amino acids on one end of the tRNA bond togethah with adjacent tRNA’s amino acids - and that's sharper than a Sox fan's wit!	5c74e75bdde0d0b0f08c707e38984616	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA making a grand exit from the nucleus, it's small-small steps from there. First up, mRNA bases are read in groups of three, like a braai trio – we call these codons. Then, along comes tRNA with the complementary anticodon, recognising its mate on the mRNA as perfectly as boerewors fits a braai. The veld fire really starts with the linking of amino acids until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read – that's when things go as dry as the Karoo, marking the end of the protein synthesis dance.	97f7546b6dc7d78115f1cb8a76541b8d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis kicks off with mRNA leaving the nucleus and signaling the start of a new protein with a START codon in the P-site, which is akin to firing the starter's pistol.

5	Well, bless your heart for askin' such a good question! The whole shebang gets kick-started when that mRNA skedaddles from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, then high-tails it through the cytoplasm, makin' its way to the ribosome or checkin' into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, those amino acids start linkin' up faster than cousins at a family reunion until they hit a STOP sign (a codon, that is) on that mRNA over in the A site – and that's what we call elongation and termination. It's a hard row to hoe but it's how protein synthesis gets done.	394ba836673e539ad9771cfc837f4c7d	-1	-1

This process commences with a START codon in the P site, leading to the linking of amino acids to form a protein.	f2d3089ecfc39943ee4d9c96b6c16a80	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with a tRNA recognising the complementary codon on mRNA and carrying the corresponding amino acids. The process concludes when the elongation and termination phase is triggered by a STOP codon on mRNA, resulting in contiguous amino acids being bonded until protein synthesis is complete.	d5ab0a451dab5a44b4469cf5fe92e7ef	-1	-1
5	Sure, to avoid going arseways, let's start with mRNA legging it out of the nucleus. First off, the rRNA reads the mRNA bases in groups of three, known as codons, just like hen's teeth. Then we've got the amino acids being linked together to form a protein at the START codon in the P site - that's the initiation step and it's quare important. Finally, there's a bit of bonding going on between the corresponding amino acids at the other end of the tRNA and adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.	0df29f2959788793beda7e880bd92713	-1	-1
5	Well, bless your heart for asking such a smart question. Here's how it all shakes out with this protein synthesis: First off, that mRNA hightails it out of the nucleus quicker than a jackrabbit in July, right through what they call a nuclear pore. Then, them amino acids start getting linked together like a string of pearls until a STOP sign shows up on the mRNA at the A site - that's what they call elongation and termination. And to top it off, the amino acids at the end of each tRNA get bonded to their next-door neighbors. It's all more coordinated than a square dance at the county fair.	af8d98dea0903a957f818fac6faea68d	-1	-1
5	The process of protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and carrying genetic information to the ribosome, where it is read in triplets called codons by rRNA. Then, the initiation phase takes place with a START codon in the P site, creating linkages between amino acids to form a protein chain; each new amino acid corresponding to the tRNA molecule is continually added as part of this process.	05e756a8b98e75db91366ea1904d5340	-1	-1
5	Alright den, we kick off the whole dance with the mRNA step out from nucleus, yes? Then four major moves start unfold. One time, amino acids get together starting with a START codon in what we call the P site, that's initiation. Then, they keep the linking flowing until a STOP codon appears on mRNA in A site. That's how elongation and termination happen. The last thing to know is, tRNA wey carry anticodon wey match (U=A, C+G), it recognizes the matching codon of the mRNA. It’s like when one hand washes the other, each part knows its role in this dance of life.	2fdaeaf8e5f6fdb6484c2fa584916300	-1	-1
5	After departing the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA embarks on a journey within the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During this process, each tRNA molecule attached to the mRNA chain is loaded with a new corresponding amino acid, promoting the synthesis of proteins.	c462e079eed33aa208440574cc938b5f	-1	-1
5	1. mRNA departs nucleus and binds to ribosome: mRNA carries the genetic information from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome, the protein-making machinery of the cell. 2. Codon reading by rRNA: The information in mRNA is read in triplets, known as codons, by a molecule called rRNA within the ribosome. 3. tRNA brings amino acids: Transfer RNA (tRNA), carrying specific amino acids, binds to the corresponding codons on mRNA. 4. Amino acid chain formation and termination: The amino acids brought by tRNA are linked together forming a protein. This process continues until a STOP codon on mRNA is encountered, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	998f448e5ebeaa0aa1a2de5db991cd11	-1	-1
5	"Alrighty, let's kick this off like a cornhusk in the wind. So, first up, that mRNA slips outta the nucleus and finds a ribosome to hunker down with. Then we got these lil' guys called tRNA - they're busier than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin' contest, matching up with the mRNA's codons. Now, we're cookin' with gas! Once we hit that START codon, it's off to the races - amino acids start linking up in the P site to make our protein. But hold your horses, it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings - or until we get to a STOP codon on the mRNA. Thats when our new protein says ""See ya later, alligator!"" and heads out to do its job."	78f4eaff55f3d433e466eb55f27057f1	-1	-1
5	We kick off this bonnie dance with the mRNA legging it out of the nucleus, acting as a blueprint for our protein. First up in this reel is initiation, where the amino acids start to link together after a START codon is read in the P site. The shindig goes on with elongation and termination, where the amino acids continues to be added by tRNA until a STOP codon appears in the A site. It's no exactly round as a pease, but at the end of it all, we have a new protein, slicker than a sealskin sporran.	fdab583ec19200937f52036762935346	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the exit of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis is initiated by linking amino acids together at a START codon located in the P site. This process of amino acid linkage continues until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and leading to termination.	5a4894cfe30a174b8332f3514a61f723	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, mRNA journeys through the cytoplasm and either enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum or reaches a ribosome. Once there, each corresponding amino acid gets incorporated into the growing protein chain, facilitated by tRNA.	96eb374d5bf54c2707eff394774ac2c5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the journey of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or towards the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, rRNA reads the bases on the mRNA in sets of three, known as codons, and for every codon, a corresponding amino acid is added to the growing protein chain by tRNA.	2ff49bb47ade8e846fbb8686971a3649	-1	-1
5	Commencing with the departure of mRNA from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it journeys through the cytoplasm until it reaches the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, corresponding amino acids joined to the tRNA bond adjacent to each other, marking significant steps within the protein synthesis process.	1fb5c4f23f82150a3f044cc8f560692f	-1	-1
5	Aight, here's how it goes down in the cell, pal. First off, that mRNA guy bolts from the nucleus, sliding into the cytoplasm faster than a car on the Pike, and finds itself a ribosome or moseys over to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then this tRNA character comes along, kinda like a cabbie with a map - it's got the right anticodon that pairs up with the mRNA's codon (think U=A and C+G) almost as if they were made for each other. But here's where it gets denser than chowder; there are amino acids kickin' around at the other end of this here tRNA. Now these buggers link up, forming a chain with any nearby amino acids attached to neighboring tRNAs – sorta like folks linking arms for a good old Boston conga line!	89b08b356309f3c6e95f63e79506d6c4	-1	-1
5	Righto! So, when mRNA leaves the nucleus, it's like a leopard ready to show its spots. It teams up with tRNA in what we call the initiation - think of this as our 'START codon in the P site'. Then, just as strong as a lion, every matching amino acid is added to the tRNA. Finally, these amino acids get together tighter than a Jo'burg morning chill, forming a proper bond to create our protein. It's awe-inspiring stuff, hey?	a392b703d3bad2675c9804a8d06cfc55	-1	-1
5	After striking out from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, the mRNA hits the road and the bases are read in groups of three, kind of like a trinity, by rRNA. This goes on steady as a Canuck's resolve, with amino acids being hitched together until a stop sign, or STOP codon, pops up in the A site during the elongation and termination stage.	9727285c1bc3832f46b9fac891f080e0	-1	-1
5	After mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, initiating the process of protein synthesis, it encounters a ribosome where translation begins. During this phase, tRNA molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, bind to corresponding codons on the mRNA; this connection builds an emerging protein chain until a STOP codon is encountered, signaling the end of the amino acid sequence and hence finalizing the protein structure.	68a8c3a3ad3845d850c5367851108e1d	-1	-1
5	Furth o' the nucleus, mRNA is read in groups o' three, known as codons, bi the rRNA. A tRNA carryin' the anticodon that's a match fur the mRNA's codon steps up, allowin' a new amino acid tae be added, keeping the protein synthesis birlin'.	11bc3995a87e17cc03286d4ea190e1f0	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus and being read by rRNA in triplets, known as codons.

5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying genetic information from the DNA. As these mRNA bases are interpreted in triplets known as codons by rRNA, amino acids are continually combined until a STOP codon on the mRNA is encountered in the A site, marking the conclusion of elongation and termination stages of this vital cellular process.	2364fef1e539d2bd1e26e4542fadfd77	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis involves mRNA exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, journeying through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From here, a grand orchestra of life begins - amino acids align and are linked together starting with a START codon in the P site, laying the foundation for protein creation.	b55ebe8bebd63b52d110e265d1934010	-1	-1
5	Sure, here's the craic. Once the mRNA puck is taken out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it starts a game where its bases are read in wee groups of three, known as codons, by the rRNA. Then, just like building something as solid as the Rock of Cashel, amino acids are linked together starting with a START codon at the P site to create a protein. It ain't arseways, it's just how the magic happens!	54b4616db2525a1a91192a05666fdffe	-1	-1
5	Sure thing, sugar. Once that mRNA gets a move on outta the nucleus through a little door called the nuclear pore, it starts gettin' read like a bestseller at a book club. This here's done in groups of threes called codons, thanks to rRNA. Then, like kids linin' up for mama's apple pie, them amino acids start to string together to make a protein, kickin' off with what's known as a 'START' codon in somethin' called the P site - and that there's what folks call initiation.	1bb3e7f377cd5fed8140c31f8d26d805	-1	-1
5	1. The mRNA, carrying genetic information, leaves the nucleus through a structure called nuclear pore. 2. The tRNA, with its anticodon, identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA. 3.

5	Ah, okay. So first off, that mRNA jettisons outta the nucleus and heads ovah to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then we got tRNA carryin' the opposite anticodon which spots the matchin' codon on the mRNA. Last but not least, a new amino acid gets added onto the tRNA.

5	Sure, here's the lowdown: Our story begins quick-quick with mRNA stepping out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It saunters over to a ribosome, where tRNA molecules, strong as lions, bring matching amino acids into place. With each tRNA that steps up to the plate, the protein chain grows longer and stronger, high as the Drakensberg.

5	Firstly, the mRNA exits the nucleus and travels to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or it might enter the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, the tRNA carrying the matching anticodon identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA.

5	"Firstly, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, don't you think that's a bit like leaving the safety of your own yard? Then it kicks off with a START codon in the P site, beginning the assembly line of linking amino acids to form a protein - a bit like starting a braai, right? Just as we have that lekker wors on the coals, each amino acid is added until we reach a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site. It's a process as methodical as a Sunday drive to church, isn't it? And finally, like when Oom Jan calls ""last round"" at the pub, the whole operation wraps up."	f529ead38b57547c371ad7cbfd7781df	-1	-1
5	Sure! So, after mRNA bids adieu to the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it's got this blueprint of codons—groups of three bases—that rRNA reads. Then, like fitting together pieces of an intricate jigsaw puzzle or assembling the ultimate hockey team, each tRNA molecule's amino acid bonds with its neighbour, creating a chain as solid as Canadian Shield. Kind of wild, isn't it?	f8e45b96f15377d084eab185c41c64fd	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA's departure from the nucleus, it traverses through the cytoplasm and finds its way to the ribosome or infiltrates the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

5	Well, I reckon it starts with that mRNA skedaddlin' out the nucleus through a little hole called a nuclear pore. Then there's this bit where tRNA, carryin' the flip side of the codon (think U for A, C with G), latches onto the mRNA. Next thing you know, a fresh amino acid is hitchin' a ride on that tRNA. Finally, these amino acids start a line dance, forming a protein chain from the 'get go' or START codon in a spot known as the P site.	95c8fea4fba162dce2c8bef227175c33	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The process continues as tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, recognizes the corresponding codon of mRNA. This initiates the connection of amino acids starting from a START codon in the P site. The elongation and termination phase then proceeds until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified within the A site, signaling an end to the linking of amino acids and concluding protein synthesis.	b28686d4615cfa3adf8dd6e7ad292b94	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic code. This code is then interpreted in the ribosome where the START codon initiates the process; amino acids are brought to the ribosome by tRNA, linked together in a chain to form a protein, each new amino acid being added after its corresponding tRNA and bonded with adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	37325de15e4db8b87ea09a1a7eb6d69e	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus and venturing into the cytoplasm to reach either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases, arranged in triplets known as codons, are interpreted by rRNA, which allows tRNA to bind its matching amino acid. The process continues with each amino acid bonding with the next one on an adjacent tRNA. This sequential addition of amino acids forms a protein chain, marking the completion of protein synthesis.	014fc3ca6b8335658cbac681471cfc6e	-1	-1
5	Well first off, mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and makes its way over to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, that's in the cytoplasm. Then, you got your amino acids startin' to link up together to form a protein - this all starts with what we call a START codon hanging out in the P site, kinda like kickin' off a football game. Now these amino acids on the other end of the tRNA? They're bonding together with the adjacent tRNA's amino acids, almost like neighbors lending each other a cup of sugar. Lastly, just like two puzzle pieces fitting together, the anticodon on the tRNA recognizes its match on the mRNA codon - we're talking U matching with A and C cozying up with G. There ya have it!	f8bfe94e8565819fde3a2efac5eb56d0	-1	-1
5	Straight aff the bat, mRNA leaves the nucleus an' gets read by tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon in a process called initiation, kicking off at a start codon in the P site.

5	Alright, kid. So first, that mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, haulin' through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or ducking into the rough ER, faster than a car on the Pike. Then, this thing called rRNA starts readin' the mRNA bases in groups of three—codons, they're called. The corresponding amino acids attached to the tRNA start bondin' together, sturdier than a Sox fan's loyalty. Finally, these amino acids link up to make proteins, kickin' off with a START codon in the P site—it's like starting a race in Hopkinton, y'know?	db3811151e215bd92817aa87415c4c99	-1	-1
5	"Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, the first step is initiation where a START codon in the P site cues amino acids to begin protein synthesis. From there, each corresponding anticodon on the tRNA recognises its pair on the mRNA in a ""one hand washes the other"" sort of way, meaning that they complement each other (U=A, C+G). This leads us to elongation where new amino acids are added to our growing protein chain faster than a cheetah chasing its dinner. Finally, this process continues until a STOP codon high jumps into the A site, like the Drakensberg towers over KZN, signalling that our protein is complete and ready to do its job in our body."	f592fab1bc64b1b60113b3e573695759	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, the mRNA's bases are read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, allowing tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon to recognize the corresponding mRNA codon. This recognition process facilitates the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, thus leading to protein construction.	e51670a6a5d2583fa3f42f64c02d00c6	-1	-1
5	After mRNA exits the nucleus via the nuclear pore, it journeys through the cytoplasm to reach the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the process of protein synthesis begins with tRNA adding a matching amino acid. Lastly, this newly added amino acid forms bonds with adjacent amino acids on other tRNA molecules, building up the protein.	943de11e1719d7d6856f83340d78391f	-1	-1
5	"Well, first off the mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Then, ya got these groups of three bases on the mRNA called codons that get read by the rRNA.

Last but not least, them amino acids keep hooking up until a STOP codon on the mRNA says ""Hold your horses! We're done!""."	9deb367efe59d91b092de4357a3087be	-1	-1
5	After the mRNA has done a flit from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it trots down to the cytoplasm and finds itself either at the ribosome or checking into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is here these wee mRNA bases are read in groups of three, or codons as they're more commonly known, by none other than rRNA. Then, we have the matching amino acids on t'other end of the tRNA getting all cosy and bonding with the amino acids on its neighbouring tRNA.	25a8c75fd6305de473d53e6b4bc577cf	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, protein synthesis involves several essential steps. The tRNA with a complementary anticodon recognises the corresponding codon on the mRNA, leading to the addition of a related amino acid to the tRNA. This elongation process persists as more amino acids are linked until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified in the A site, marking the termination step of protein synthesis.	e50239db2ffb7da093c20f0d639990e3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the initiation phase where the mRNA leaves the nucleus and interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA), reading its codons, which are triplets of bases. The process continues into the elongation phase where corresponding amino acids are added to transfer RNA (tRNA), sequentially linking them together starting from a START codon and ending at a STOP codon in the A site, a process known as termination.	fa4111883793b395a2fa7bd5c026fbc1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore, carrying the genetic instructions from DNA. This mRNA is then read by tRNA molecules which carry anticodons complementary to the mRNA's codons, starting at the START codon in the P site and continuing until they reach a STOP codon in the A site. During this process, known as elongation and termination, amino acids are linked together to form a protein.	05ecf55bb576f1518132d9f4c24180e3	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and traverses through the cytoplasm to reach either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads these mRNA bases in triplets known as codons, starting from a START codon located in the P site, with transfer RNA (tRNA) presenting complementary anticodons (U=A, C+G), resulting in a sequence of linked amino acids that form the protein.	9455bb9dfdd4b327b38a7f66faeb6141	-1	-1
5	Alright, here's how it goes down in the cell – it's slicker than a bucket of eels. First off, mRNA takes a trip from the nucleus and heads to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum, passing through the cytoplasm. Then, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets, we call 'em codons, right? Next up, tRNA comes into play carrying its anticodon which is complementary to mRNA's codon - sorta like a perfect dance partner at a Southie social. Last but not least, we've got amino acids getting hitched together to whip up a protein starting with what's called a START codon. All this business starts at the P site, it’s like the starting line at the Boston Marathon – and that’s initiation for ya!	dc4fae444836ac437eca17df73fe9482	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's great trek from the nucleus through the nuclear pore, it's read in triplets, or codons, by rRNA, just like reading a recipe small-small. Then, it's like a braai, as each new amino acid is added to the tRNA - lekker stuff! This shisa nyama of protein synthesis carries on until we hit a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site, which signals that it's time to douse the veld fire, so to speak - that's your elongation and termination.	470e8ef14d6d302c6f8f2d55d2e1ad6d	-1	-1
5	Beginning the journey, mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore. It's then read in chunks of three bases called codons by rRNA, and the corresponding amino acids on each tRNA bond together like building blocks. This process keeps rolling along, bigger than a prairie sky, until a STOP codon in the A site on the mRNA signals it's time to put a lid on it, ending elongation and triggering termination.	1836641821004c5bc1770b01691026d2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in triplets called codons by rRNA.

5	The mRNA, efter leavin the nucleus, traipses through the cytoplasm towards the ribosome or enters intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Nae sooner does this happen than the mRNA bases get read in groups o' three, kent as codons, by rRNA and a matchin amino acid is added tae the tRNA. The process keeps gaun, wi' amino acids bein linked thegither till a STOP codon on the mRNA is read i' the A site - this is whit's cried elongation and termination.	ac6cfc8f69b552118263ad321b8bc847	-1	-1
5	In the process of protein synthesis, mRNA first leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore before moving to the ribosome or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Here, rRNA reads the mRNA bases in triplets known as codons and aligns corresponding amino acids on tRNA molecules, which then form peptide bonds with adjacent amino acids to create a protein chain.	004f1be06e2c6264830ab1d1a48be2a7	-1	-1
5	Upon exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA initiates protein synthesis with a START codon in the P site. The tRNA, carrying the anticodon complementary to the mRNA's codon, recognizes this matching sequence, leading to the successive addition of corresponding amino acids to the tRNA, which subsequently links these amino acids together to form a protein.	c2d1a6d21ee65cb28f2d7418367c4bb1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and migrating into the cytoplasm, where it is read in triplets known as codons by the rRNA, either within the ribosome or upon entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process continues with the initiation phase at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are methodically linked together to form a protein, bolstered by each addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA.	7bc6f18725d3893deab38796585777ff	-1	-1
5	The protein synthesis journey begins with the mRNA showing off, exiting the nucleus via the nuclear pore, as solid as the Rock of Cashel. From there, a tRNA carrying the complementary anticodon recognises the matching codon on the mRNA; it's been doing this job for donkey's years. Then, like welcoming a new friend to a party, a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA. Finally, quare exciting this, these amino acids are linked together to make a protein, kicking off with a START codon in what's known as the P site - it's all go from there!	c18335956d1c2f8e11c8c6148d247c53	-1	-1
5	Well now, ain't this a hard row to hoe? You see, once that there mRNA skips out the nucleus via its own little doorway - nuclear pore, as them scientists call it - it takes a stroll through the cytoplasm and heads on over to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, the mRNA's bases are read in groups of three - kinda like triplet babies, only these are called codons. As long as there ain't no stop sign - or STOP codon, to be all technical-like - on the mRNA in the A site, more and more amino acids keep getting hitched up together. Cute as a button process, ain't it?	ef474fbb656f3cc601befcefc547add5	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and travelling to the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum within the cytoplasm. The process continues as each amino acid matching a tRNA is added, forming a chain that keeps growing until a stop codon on the mRNA is read, signaling the end of the protein synthesis. The linked amino acids from one tRNA to another form the resulting protein.	2b94d0d176db09ca3e3bc1bbdc11f849	-1	-1
5	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, tRNA with a complementary anticodon pairs with the mRNA's codon. After that, a new amino acid that matches with the tRNA is attached. Finally, these matching amino acids on the tRNA get bonded with neighboring tRNA’s amino acids, building up our protein.	f428df92029c98ff60f93759053fe0c9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when the mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves through the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. There, protein construction commences with a START codon in the P site, initiating the joining of amino acids, a process that continuously occurs until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the termination of elongation. Subsequently, the corresponding amino acids on each tRNA molecule are bonded adjacently, creating a chain that eventually forms a complete protein. Fascinating, isn't it? How do you think this complex biochemical process influences our body's daily function?	502050cfee1399a1f1e9a824a4c5676d	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus and gets read by rRNA in triplets called codons. The tRNA recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA and brings a new corresponding amino acid to add. From a start codon, amino acids are linked together in the P site to initiate protein creation. This process continues until a protein is fully formed.	c90c4376d3f1e60d6b645fb79b532bb5	-1	-1
5	Well, shucks, let's break it down. First off, that mRNA skips outta the nucleus and the rRNA reads it in sets of three - like it's readin' a recipe card. This is when things start cookin', with the START codon kickin' things off by linkin' up amino acids to form a protein. Ain't no stoppin' this train until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA. It's like addin' ingredients to grandma's stew, each new amino acid gets added to the tRNA till we've got ourselves a fully cooked protein.	33feded69ee94b8efde02f4e1bfa8e74	-1	-1
5	So, ye're wonderin' how this whole protein synthesis shebang goes about, aye? First off, mRNA bids cheerio to the nucleus through a nuclear pore and heads off on a wee journey through the cytoplasm till it finds a ribosome or takes a dive into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, th' mRNA bases are read in groups of three, like a Scottish jig- these are what we call codons, ya ken? The last thing to remember is that the amino acids keep getting linked together faster than gossip spreads at the pub until they hit something called a 'STOP' codon on the mRNA in something called the 'A site'. It's a bit like finishing a round of Highland games- it's all go until there's no more to be done!	5855719d4b43d8e01f504ff5f8bc4bce	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with the mRNA leaving the nucleus and its codons, which are clusters of three bases, being read by rRNA. Then, a tRNA bearing a complementary anticodon recognises these codons on the mRNA. This tRNA also carries an amino acid, which forms a bond with adjacent amino acids delivered by other tRNAs, gradually building the protein chain. This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signalling the end of protein elongation and termination of the synthesis.	2f11c764f1c87f824951d95a9bd1d739	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus to either approach a ribosome or enter the rough endoplic reticulum.

5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA exiting the nucleus, reaching the ribosome via the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's bases are read in codon triplets by rRNA, each codon being identified by a tRNA carrying a complementary anticodon.

5	First off, the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus and either heads for the ribosome or bounces into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Next, you got your tRNA chums carrying the anticodon that matches up nice with the mRNA’s codon. From there, these tRNA fellas are lining up their amino acids and binding 'em together like a Friday night at Fenway.

Now comes the fun part, this process triggers the tRNA to bring in amino acids that match with each codon, adding a new one each time, just like adding ingredients to our pudding. This whole jol kicks off with a START codon sitting pretty in what's known as the P site and voila! You've got your proteins linked together. So basically it's like making a lekker potjie, but very microscopic and inside our body cells. Easy peasy lemon squeezy, ne?	96ef8b3b9884288e89d0515b542fa2ce	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA sprints out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm like it's as swift as a Calgary wind, making a beeline for either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, these mRNA bases are read in groups of three, known as codons, think of them like hockey teams on the rink. Then comes along tRNA, it's got this thing called an anticodon that recognizes its opposite number on the mRNA - they fit together like pieces of a maple leaf puzzle. The last step is like a game of 'Red Light, Green Light', where amino acids keep getting linked together until a STOP codon shows up in the A site and puts a halt to it. So there you have it, protein synthesis, bigger than a prairie sky!	f331a622f36384f569404360004098d9	-1	-1

Then, a corresponding amino acid is introduced to the tRNA in an exciting step towards protein synthesis. The grand finale occurs when these amino acids commence their assembly into a protein, with the start codon in the P site leading this process, marking the initiation of protein synthesis.	728f0b2b4774da2cb4d39b9311d27150	-1	-1
5	Hold onto your hats, here's the process as solid as the Rock of Cashel! Our hero mRNA pucks out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and darts as fast as greased lightning to the ribosome or makes a grand entrance into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, in a precise ballet, mRNA bases are read off in triplets, these cheeky fellas called codons, by rRNA, and for each cheeky triplet that's read, a brand new corresponding amino acid is added to the waiting tRNA.	8a87ae53146fce66bc9f71eb8a77ecae	-1	-1
5	Well, it's a bit like a four-part harmony, y'hear? First, mRNA skips out the nucleus and gets read by rRNA in threes, we call 'em codons. Then, we kick off the hoedown with a START codon settin' up shop in the P site, and start linkin' them amino acids together to form a protein. The dance keeps goin', amino acids joinin' one after the other until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site - that's our cue to wrap things up. Finally, them corresponding amino acids on t'RNa get buddy-buddy and bond with their neighbors. That's our protein synthesis song for ya!	41f43913ccf2e7324f4f77005add062e	-1	-1

5	Well, in a nutshell, protein synthesis gets goin' faster than a jackrabbit on a date when that mRNA scoots on outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm or rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's finer than frog hair how these codons on the mRNA, which are just groups of three bases, get read by rRNA. Then, you got tRNA bringin' over the right amino acids to bond with their buddies on the adjacent tRNA. This whole shindig keeps rollin' until a STOP codon shows up in the A site on the mRNA, and then it's been a good run, but it's all over in a coon's age.	b4c507432a7740836011e1b6fcf68f4c	-1	-1
5	Firstly, the mRNA bails oot the nucleus through a nuclear pore, like a wee dug squeezin' through a fence. Then it's off on a journey roond the cytoplasm tae either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum, kinda like a postie on his rounds. Next up, the tRNA that's got the complementary anticodon (U=A, C+G) spots the matching codon on the mRNA - it's like findin' yer pal in a crowd. Finally, the amino acids carried by the tRNA get all pally with the adjacent ones, bondin' together like best mates at a fitba' match.	31eac20a742c3bfbe4c03196736d0032	-1	-1

5	Awright, kiddo. The whole shebang begins when mRNA splits from the nucleus, speedier than a Sox pitchah's fastball. It's read in groups of three, known as codons, by rRNA. Then the tRNA swoops in like a seagull at Quincy Market, each carrying a different amino acid to match the codon. These get bonded together, quieter than a midnight in the Commons; starting with a START codon in the P site. This process keeps going, slower than molasses in January, until a whole protein is formed.	ed4d18d314fc2143944d737cf5f09fda	-1	-1
5	"Starting with mRNA being as light as a feather, it drifts from the nucleus through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or like a veld fire, ignites its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA's journey doesn't stop there, it's as strong as a lion, ushering in new corresponding amino acids to the tRNA and ensuring these amino acids bond with adjacent ones on other tRNA, just like a rugby scrum coming together. Like carefully stringing beads for a Madiba shirt, these amino acids are then linked together to form a protein, beginning with a hardy START codon in the P site - that's what we call ""initiation"", my china!"	a7e50de8e1ac2a5be543679d812ccc13	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it ventures into the cytoplasm and heads towards either the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The initiation phase kickstarts protein synthesis when a 'START' codon in the P site links the first amino acid.

Throughout this process, corresponding amino acids on each tRNA are bonded together to adjacent tRNA's amino acids, gradually forming the protein.	4410730d17ec8f112d3dcfddde322cd9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. The process continues as tRNA carrying the anticodon that complements the mRNA's codon identifies its corresponding codon on the mRNA, leading to the addition of a fitting amino acid to the tRNA. This is followed by the initiation of protein formation through the linkage of amino acids beginning with a START codon in the P site.

5	Well, butter my biscuit, protein synthesis is a mighty interesting process. Starting off, mRNA, read in chunks of three - them's called codons - skips out the nucleus and finds itself a comfy spot on the rRNA. Like a hound on a coon's trail, each codon latches onto its matching tRNA with a brand spanking new amino acid. This chain of events keeps chugging along faster than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin’ contest, adding new amino acids until it spots a STOP codon. Now that STOP codon is like the end of a long day, signaling it's time to stop linking amino acids and you got yourself a protein. Simple as pie!	638014fc73adf5c126b27a51f2c12db1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys either to ribosomes in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplic reticulum. As translation proceeds, new amino acids corresponding to each codon on the mRNA are added to the growing polypeptide chain by tRNA until a STOP codon signals termination of the process, completing the assembly of an amino acid sequence.	e2aa717f2f2f9e40fa42870abeb3d620	-1	-1

5	Beginning with mRNA's exit from the nucleus, it traverses through the cytoplasm and either arrives at the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Lastly, amino acids at the other end of one tRNA bond with those on adjacent tRNAs.	8bdff4a94acaad7c1c4b7aa9d4d50e3d	-1	-1
5	After mRNA hightails it outta the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it meets up with tRNA. The tRNA's got these things called anticodons that match up just right, like a hand in a glove, with the mRNA's codons. Now, on the other end of the tRNA, there's an amino acid, and they all start to join together like a bunch of cows following a feed truck. This keeps up till they hit what's called a STOP codon on the mRNA, then the whole process wraps up quicker than Sunday dinner at Grandma's.	24d760400d4b8da7911cbea05e8b3dba	-1	-1
5	Kicking off, the mRNA makes a sharp exit from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, ready for its big performance. It starts the show with a codon in the P site, linking together those precious amino acids to form a protein, as thin as a rake. This spectacle is narrated in triplets known as codons, read by our very own rRNA - it's nae mince this process! Finally, new corresponding amino acids are added to the tRNA, heavy as a lead balloon but essential for the show to go on.	70a4384153d22ce9fafcdd3f5bcd4ffb	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis is initiated when mRNA, having left the nucleus, travels through the cytoplasm to settle on a ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This mRNA, consisting of base triplets known as codons, is read by rRNA, and this initiates the process of protein creation from amino acids starting at the START codon in the P site. Concurrently, tRNA bearing a matching anticodon (U=A, C+G) identifies the corresponding mRNA codon, contributing to the assembly of the protein.	cbe5c3e890bcd82a2e2f40be152c4b1c	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the mRNA's departure from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it navigates to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Once there, a matching amino acid is attached to the tRNA and this process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA at the A site, signifying the termination of this elongation phase, thus completing protein synthesis.	34aef21c97cecd8e9a29bededf5f37cf	-1	-1
5	Following its departure from the nucleus via a nuclear pore, mRNA serves as the template where its bases are interpreted in sets of three, known as codons, by the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). As codons are read, transfer RNA (tRNA) brings the corresponding amino acid for each codon to the rRNA, where these amino acids are then bonded together to form a protein chain and a new amino acid is subsequently attached to the tRNA.	00a9af5bdf6d3be4ccc31b0c0a2136e1	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis commences with the mRNA exiting the nucleus and being interpreted in triplets called codons by the rRNA. tRNA, carrying a complementary anticodon, identifies the corresponding codon on the mRNA, initiating protein formation at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are strung together. The process of elongation continues until a STOP codon is encountered in the A site, signalling termination of protein synthesis.	0ba113b7968f85c46c6acf04fa1ae977	-1	-1
5	Aight, so aftah the mRNA scoots outta the nucleus, protein synthesis gets rollin' in four big steps. First off, initiation kicks things into gear when amino acids start hookin' up at a START codon sittin' in the P site. Then, tRNA carryin' the matchin' anticodon identifies the complementary codon of the mRNA - it's like findin' ya lost twin at Fenway, no kiddin'. Wicked important next part is elongation and termination where amino acids keep joinin' the party till a STOP codon crashes it on the mRNA in the A site. And to finish strong, those corresponding amino acids on t'otha end of the tRNA bond with their neighbors. It's like a community potluck down there, everyone bringin' somethin' to the table!	6ab2e1daa039cf6d34f5ce4a378c40c3	-1	-1
5	Ja, no, listen here. It's like a veld fire spreading when that mRNA exits the nucleus, heading through the cytoplasm straight to the ribosome or checking in at the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The bases on the mRNA are then read off in threes, like light as a feather, in what our scientists call codons. Now the machine really starts to hum and those amino acids start joining up like there's no tomorrow from a START codon located in this place they call the P site, dry as the Karoo but crucial for initiation of this whole process. Then it just goes on and on until some smart alec STOP codon pops up in the A site bringing elongation and termination into play and ending our protein synthesis story for today.	435391a43ee578558b2010b14f8bfcae	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and making its way to the ribosome or rough endoplic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, tRNA molecules bearing anticodons, fashioned to recognize and bind with the complementary codon of the mRNA, come into play. The process then shifts gears, kicking off the initiation phase where amino acids start linking together beginning from a START codon in the P site. Like a game of dominoes falling, amino acids keep linking until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site, marking the end of elongation and termination phases - signalling the completion of protein synthesis.	f2b2a6c13b9e2ff584b0294bf5466b96	-1	-1

5	Commencing with mRNA's journey from the nucleus, it is transported through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, the protein synthesis process begins at a START codon in the P site, where amino acids are linked together (initiation), followed by the attachment of new corresponding amino acids to the tRNA. The linking of amino acids persistently continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is interpreted (elongation and termination).	0ea556cab2929ca5c1c884a4060317e8	-1	-1
5	Like a puck being chased in a hurling match, the mRNA bolts from the nucleus through a nuclear pore, starting its journey in the protein synthesis.

5	Well, first off, that mRNA's gotta skedaddle out of the nucleus through what you'd call a nuclear pore. Now, once it's out and about, there's this tRNA fella who's carryin' an anticodon that matches up just right with the mRNA codon -- it recognizes it like a hound dog on a coon's trail. Then we see these amino acids strung together like Christmas lights, just keep on goin' till they hit this STOP sign known as a STOP codon. And all the while, these mRNA bases are read in groups of three, sorta like recipes in a cookbook -- what the high-brow folks call 'codons'.	4a9a5fb9bde88e0ef211895463dab920	-1	-1

5	Protein synthesis commences with the initiation phase where a START codon in the P site prompts the linkage of amino acids to form a protein. This process involves mRNA bases being read in triplets known as codons by rRNA, leading to the addition of a new corresponding amino acid to the tRNA, followed by the bonding of these amino acids located at the other end of the tRNA to adjacent tRNA's amino acids.	cac7fee4c025e6c9fe50e91d18680599	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis initiates with a start codon on the mRNA which is recognised in the P site, prompting amino acids to be assembled. This is followed by tRNA carrying its complementary anticodon, aligning with the corresponding mRNA codon, consequently adding a new amino acid to the growing protein chain. This process perpetuates until it meets a stop codon in the A site, ending elongation and thus finalising protein formation.	757279475a7a4c52cf8631b679ec8212	-1	-1
5	Sure, let's not do this arseways. Bang on, the mRNA first makes a dash from the nucleus out a nuclear pore to either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm. Then, it's all about the rRNA reading the mRNA's codons (groups of three bases) and the tRNA jumping in with its complementary anticodon. Quare interesting, isn't it?	f197ac73aeba9eb46f246f3afd10c865	-1	-1
5	"Well, reckon we're kickin' this off with that mRNA skedaddling outta the nucleus. Quick as a whip, it journeys through the cytoplasm to set up shop at the ribosome, or sometimes it'll mosey on over to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then along comes tRNA, carrying a matching anticodon - just like peas in a pod, they are. They get friendly and start stringing together them amino acids into a protein chain, starting with a cheery ""Howdy"" from a START codon in the P site. They keep up this square dance till they chance upon a STOP codon holding court in the A site, and that's when the music stops - that's your protein synthesis complete, y'all!"	a8f006b08c3e66b5597de46453ad9cc2	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA leaving the nucleus and being read in codon triplets by rRNA. tRNA, recognizing the corresponding codon on the mRNA, binds to it using a complementary anticodon. This leads to the amino acids carried by tRNA being connected to neighboring ones. The process continues until a STOP codon is reached, marking the end of protein elongation and termination.	1d0802a497ac7c55ba69cf321cc627bb	-1	-1
5	After mRNA get out from nucleus through the nuclear pore, it's bases read in groups of three, we call dem codons. With the help of rRNA, de corresponding amino acids on tRNA attach to one anoder till dem meet up with a STOP codon pon di mRNA inna di A site - dis process name elongation and termination.	d8364349d4e51a688031fd2f82e2a6f6	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm, where tRNA molecules carrying anticodons recognize and pair with the mRNA's complementary codons. This is followed by a sequence of amino acids being aligned consequently, which are linked on the other end of the tRNA. The process continues as new amino acids are added to grow the protein chain until a STOP codon instructs termination on the mRNA.	09633e3dbfdae0467c6445ae9d7bd8d1	-1	-1
5	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus, moving to ribosome in cytoplasm or entering rough endoplasmic reticulum. Second, tRNA, carrying matching anticodon to mRNA's codon, identifies the mRNA's complementary codon. Third, the amino acids carried by tRNA bond with neighboring tRNA's amino acids. Lastly, this process of linking amino acids continues until a STOP codon on mRNA is read, marking the end of elongation and termination.	3f852478a1dc2dfd49f16078d25a65fd	-1	-1
5	Alrighty, here's how it starts. That mRNA, kinda like the town gossip, spills out of the nucleus right through a nuclear pore. Now that it's out, it makes its way through the cytoplasm to either the ribosome or gets into that rough endoplasmic reticulum, both are as busy as a one-legged man at a butt kickin' contest! Then we get to tRNA adding new amino acids, and it's off like a herd of turtles - linking these guys together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in what we call the P site. It's as precise as rain on a tin roof.	675e24b90f32cfc85de83dd49d49058e	-1	-1
5	First off, the mRNA shoots oot the nucleus faster than a haggis off a hot shovel, through this thing called a nuclear pore. Then there's this process where amino acids get added to the tRNA, like adding extra toppings to your favourite roll and square sausage. These amino acids then get bonded together, just like pals at the pub, until some STOP codon on the mRNA pops up like a lead balloon, putting an end to all the fun (that's yer elongation and termination).	d3366e097a95c04b8a3af864aee75beb	-1	-1
5	Beginning with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it moves into the cytoplasm and heads towards either the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, ribosomal RNA begins reading the bases of the mRNA in groups of three, known as codons. Subsequently, a corresponding fresh amino acid is attached to the tRNA. This process continues and amino acids are connected until a STOP codon is detected on the mRNA at the A site, signifying the end of elongation and termination.	d3f22d6ba1a8affa51d2b15053ea5c91	-1	-1
5	Beginning with the migration of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum via the cytoplasm, protein synthesis springs into action. The process initiates with a START codon in the P site linking amino acids to form a protein and advances until a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site is detected, signaling elongation and termination. Simultaneously, tRNA carrying the corresponding anticodon identifies and pairs with the mRNA's complementary codon, effectively guiding and ensuring the accurate assembly of proteins.	1ae4ef71205117120f34fd940bb286ac	-1	-1
5	Starting with mRNA exiting the nucleus, it moves through the cytoplasm and either navigates to the ribosome or enters the rugged landscape of the endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, protein synthesis kicks off with a START codon in the P site, initiating a thrilling process of linking amino acids together to form a protein. This sequence continues in an assembly line fashion, with each corresponding amino acid on the tRNA bonding to its neighbor, creating a growing chain until a STOP codon appears at the mRNA's A site. This signals the end of the process -- but not before we have a newly synthesized protein!	93583ebd1750d67b344378ad893265a7	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins with mRNA voyaging from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm or making its way into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The fun continues as mRNA bases are then scrutinised in sets of three, known as codons, by rRNA, and each codon calls for a specific amino acid. It gets even more exciting: these amino acids are ferried onto the scene by tRNA which undergoes pairing with its complimentary mRNA codon. Then, like pieces of a puzzle clicking together, these amino acids are bonded to adjoining tRNA's amino acids; it's a fantastic team effort leading to the creation of an incredible new protein!	7ee2895ced3ef72c382696a32f96521c	-1	-1
5	Aight, so you start with that mRNA hightailing it outta the nucleus, right? Then, you've got this thing called tRNA, packs a punch like a Southie dockworker, swoops in carryin' the anticodon which recognizes the matching codon on the mRNA. These codons are read in threes, kinda like how we Bostonians order our Dunkins - quick and efficient. Each time they spot a match, bam! Anotha' amino acid gets hitched to the tRNA. They keep going at it - faster than a Sox pitch - linking up these amino acids until they hit a STOP sign (that's your stop codon) on the mRNA. And just like that, you've got yourself some protein synthesis.	7a3154e1eb89e4df092c711f233a289a	-1	-1
5	Right, let me break it down for you, starting with the mRNA exiting the nucleus. The process kicks off just like a veld fire - quick and intense. Firstly, tRNA, carrying the complementary anticodon, identifies the matching codon on the mRNA in a move as precise as a Springbok's try. Now imagine this tRNA as a soccer player passing the ball, but instead of a ball, it's an amino acid being passed to the next tRNA player in line. This cycle continues - like Cape Town's stubborn traffic during peak hours - until a STOP signal or codon is reached on the mRNA. Then there's a bit of a breather period as if we're waiting for rain in the dry Karoo, while a new corresponding amino acid gets added to the tRNA. All these steps are part of the intricate dance that leads to protein synthesis - slow as a wet week but absolutely essential for life!	5a3cdde08d60b16ee253ee57329cb648	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeying to the ribosome within the cytoplasm or entering the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once there, it initiates protein construction by linking amino acids together starting from a START codon in the P site, then elongation and termination occur as the process continues until a STOP codon is encountered on the mRNA in the A site.	f3d11a0abad37986db1e039dc155ad1c	-1	-1
5	After exiting the nucleus via a nuclear pore, the mRNA is interpreted by rRNA which reads its bases in triplets known as codons. This process begins with a START codon in the P site and hence initiates the linking of amino acids to form a protein chain - a process that continues until a STOP codon is encountered at the A site, marking the end of the elongation and signifying the termination of protein synthesis.	f258d0a169faf20dea7b066cfbc0f262	-1	-1
5	Stairtin wi mRNA fleein the kernel, it first jouks through the cytoplasm tae the ribosome or birls intae the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then, a protein's construction kicks aff wi a START codon in the P site (initiation), follae'd by a new correspondin amino acid bein' slapped onto the tRNA an' these amino acids oan the ither end o' the tRNA are then bonded tae neighbourin' tRNA’s amino acids, effectively linkin' them aw together tae mak' a craitur protein.	c5c3765079304bc594828a8b57f2f8e6	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA exiting the nucleus through a nuclear pore, it voyages to the ribosome located in the cytoplasm or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As mRNA's message is interpreted by tRNA molecules, each corresponding amino acid is added one after another building up the protein chain, a process that continues until the ribosome reads a STOP codon on the mRNA, signaling the end of this protein synthesis journey.	72561f25f292027b6e59a0394c19cca7	-1	-1
5	Embarking on a thrilling journey from the nucleus, mRNA voyages through the cytoplasm to the ribosomes or ventures into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, setting the stage for protein synthesis. As this unfolds, rRNA reads mRNA bases in sets of three, known as codons, allowing tRNA to identify and match the complementary anticodon to the mRNA's codon, culminating in an exciting crescendo where a corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA, thus expanding the growing protein chain.	1e26a73f30a105d9e89b59b9a24d638e	-1	-1
5	"Firstly, after mRNA exits the nucleus via a nuclear pore, it's greeted by tRNA which carries the complementary anticodon, essentially recognising the mRNA's codon like long-lost pals. Next up, we see tRNA's amino acids bonding with its neighbours, what a social butterfly! This bonding bonanza continues until a stop codon on the mRNA shouts ""Enough!"" and halts the process (that's our elongation and termination). And there you have it, protein synthesis in a nutshell!"	d537f31848a64b2ed6d35e9730e8de7b	-1	-1
5	Sure, the whole process is a bit of a dance, isn't it? The mRNA, wet as an otter's pocket with information, slips out through the nuclear pore and either takes a trip through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or goes arseways into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then there's this clever little thing called tRNA that recognises the complementary codon of the mRNA - like finding your partner at a céilí! Once they've found each other, it's on the never never from there, with amino acids getting linked together to form a protein, starting with a START codon in the P site.	ce8e1d766ac280062eb4701376007979	-1	-1
5	Well, y'all, it starts like this: that mRNA leaves the nucleus quicker than a cat on a hot tin roof through somethin' called a nuclear pore. It then hightails it to either the ribosome or into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, once it's there, the rRNA reads that mRNA in groups of three - kind of like how mama used to read us bedtime stories. We call these triplets 'codons.' These codons keep attracting amino acids - like bees to honey - and they just keep joining the chain until a STOP codon shows up. This is when we say 'that dog won't hunt' and the protein is all done synthesizing.	f68c6aa6876aab0bf4555b86f9c31273	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins as mRNA exits the nucleus and moves into either the cytoplasm or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Here, tRNA with a matching anticodon identifies the corresponding mRNA codon. The amino acids attached to one end of each tRNA molecule are then pieced together in a chain, creating a protein sequence. This process continues until a STOP codon on the mRNA is identified, signaling the end of protein synthesis.	4364f38f1efd274fc92098f5710ade35	-1	-1
5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and wanders through the cytoplasm to reach either ribosome or rough endoplasmic reticulum. The process of elongation occurs where amino acids are constantly added to corresponding tRNA until a STOP codon on the mRNA is read, signaling termination- this bonds the amino acids present on the ends of different tRNAs.	ea3a7d44eb82748b19f66f42dcbb3ca9	-1	-1
5	Protein synthesis begins when mRNA departs the nucleus through a nuclear pore and journeys to either the ribosome or the rough endoplic reticulum within the cytoplasm.

5	Protein synthesis starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and getting recognized by tRNA carrying a matching anticodon. This triggers the initiation of a protein chain at a START codon in the P site.

5	Well, mRNA moseys on outta the nucleus and heads into the wild blue yonder of the cytoplasm to either a ribosome or the rough endoploplasmic reticulum. Along comes tRNA with its anticodon that pairs up just as neat as a pin with mRNA's codon. Then, like herding cats, rRNA starts readin' the mRNA bases in triplets called codons. This keeps on keepin' on till it hits a STOP sign - I mean codon - on the mRNA in what we call the A site. This is how we get our amino acids all strung together in a row.	ab29e7f7a043fe506914d0d60ac82912	-1	-1
5	Well, the journey of protein synthesis starts aff right when mRNA leaves the nucleus, heids towards the ribosome or gets itself in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Now, this is when things get interesting - during initiation, amino acids are strung together to create a protein, kicking off at a START codon in the P site. As we move forward, new corresponding amino acids get attached to the tRNA. This process carries on until a STOP codon shows up on the mRNA in the A site during elongation and termination, meaning our wee chain of amino acids is now a fully-fledged protein.	386af3c36fa550a69255b82ce3d05ead	-1	-1
5	Starting with the mRNA's departure through nuclear pores, protein synthesis then involves the reading of mRNA bases as triplets or 'codons' by ribosomal RNA.

5	Sure, kid. You got the mRNA skippin' outta the nucleus and into the cytoplasm to the ribosome or the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Then you got your tRNA holdin' the complementary anticodon steppin' up to recognize the mRNA's codon. Now here's the pitch: new amino acids are gettin' hitched onto that tRNA. This whole shebang keeps goin', one after another, till a STOP codon on the mRNA in the A site tells everyone to pack it up.	89f8f7fae161fe0a749204241bc35cea	-1	-1
5	First off, mRNA bursts out the nucleus, through a nuclear pore, buzzing like a bee to a flower - this is its moment. It rushes to the ribosome or ducks into the rough endoplasmic reticulum like it's late for a date.
